If you would like to ask me a question, either about one of my blog posts or another matter, here are a few ways you 
can reach out to me.

The easiest is via email. You can contact me at raymondcamden@gmail.com. If it involves my work at Adobe, my work email address is jedimaster@adobe.com. 

I'm also available on Mastodon at @raymondcamden@raymondcamden.com. I still have a Twitter account at @raymondcamden, but I don't check it often. My DMs are open though so feel free to send me a message there as well.
