		<div class="comment_text"><p>In moving to a flat file approach, what options are there for search other than Google? I guess the main key here is outsourcing any "moving parts"? Could you still roll your own search and incorporate that as a basic feature?  Note - the Google search seems to work well, but thinking about uses where customers may not want to depend on external sources.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few months ago I saw a JavaScript-based search engine. It kept an index of data in memory and you were responsible for generating that index yourself. I didn't try it, but it would be one way of doing it. I'd only recommend it if your site was - static (heh) - ie, like a company web site or some such and not a blog which would grow in content over time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think many of us were a bit colour blind in the 1990's when designing websites! Back then I think the technical achievements were more appreciated than they are now. Too many things taken for granted now.<br>For a recent client I started using <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.keyCDN.com%3A2ojUiQeibCcjvUyapczejVoTlNQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.keyCDN.com">www.keyCDN.com</a> to automatically pull static files published to my server. The CDN caches the files for as long as you specify so hits to the original server can literally be nil while the CDN takes the full hit until you update any content. It even works with cfml pages and downloads (docs, videos, etc) too. They can set up a free SSL cert and of course you can use a CNAME to make the URL fit with your own domain. It's only 4c per GB/month for bandwidth. No cost for storage. Incredibly easy to set up and very fast. I just thought this was a relevant plug, well worth looking at. Connects to blogging apps too.</p></div>
