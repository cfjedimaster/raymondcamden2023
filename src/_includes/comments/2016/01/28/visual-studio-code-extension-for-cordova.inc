		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice addition.  Thank you for posting about it.  I've been pleased with VS Code.  It is fast and stays out of your way.  I've not tried the Mac and Linux versions yet, but that's on the list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I develop with visual studio (vb and aspx) and I used eclipse for cordova/android. Since this post I try some project using VS. It is quite valid, but didn't find how to add references needed by some plugin (for eaxample admob need google-service) what if plugin setup doesn't set the reference on android project</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not 100% sure I get what you are asking, but it sounds like you want to know if the extension can handle plugin specific mods. If so, the answer is no, and I honestly don't think *any* IDE could handle a random plugins specific instructions. Basically, if cordova plugin add X by itself is not enough, I think you will need to just follow the directions and do it by hand. To be clear, Code won't make this harder. It won't stop you.</p></div>
