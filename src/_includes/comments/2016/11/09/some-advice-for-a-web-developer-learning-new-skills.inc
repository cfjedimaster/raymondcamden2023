This could be done at a granular level to the point that as a newbie is trying to learn something, they would know how much mental energy to devote to each concept.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is what I'd do. If I'm looking at X, my first job is to determine what problem it solves. If I don't have that problem, I walk away. (Assuming I'm too busy for just random research, and obviously I try to remember X has a solution.)</p></div>
