		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not just the blog owner, but Google, too. This is a practice known as Freebooting. Usually I've seen it discussed around video content, but it's the same for written stuff: Someone stole your content and is running ads on it. The longer it remains online, the more money the freebooter and the ad company (e.g. Facebook, Blogger (Google)) reap from it. It incentivizes dragging their feet.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itsokaytobesmart.com%2Fpost%2F108548517677%2Ffacebook-freebooting-video%3ATKYcA7O6vbU4PmQiErnbQ_vnt_o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.itsokaytobesmart.com/post/108548517677/facebook-freebooting-video">http://www.itsokaytobesmart...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wouldn't even know who to contact. Do I contact AdSense, or Blogger? And with Blogger, there wasn't any way to reach a human directly, so how would I even begin.</p><p>I love all my Google services, but the number one issue with them is that as soon as one thing goes wrong, you end up against a giant wall of nothingness. I know I pay nothing for my Google services, but it's times like this when I wish there was a simple way to pay to get to a human. I'd gladly pay money to help protect my contact, even if I shouldn't have to pay. (Or perhaps they could use a system where you pay for support, and once they determine it is their issue, they refund the money.)</p></div>
