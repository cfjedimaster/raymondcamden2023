		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unless everyone is viewing the presentation full screen (which usually isn't the case), their viewport is going to be a scaled version of your desktop.</p><p>I think 1920x1080 is really the max resolution I'd use--unless your scaling is bumped up. I find it's usually easier to bump the resolution down, then to start adjusting font sizes everywhere.</p><p>I think ultimately the best size depends on the audience, but I don't think you'll ever have issues dropping the resolution down. Larger is always going to be better than too small.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another topic is scheduling. I see you used Evenbrite to do this but I am guessing this was because it was a work thing? I signed up and Eventbrite said it would email the link 30 min before the presentation. I signed up 10 min prior and never received the link to view the presentation. I know with hangout I can schedule the webinar but I would also like to have people signup for this. I was thinking of just creating a form, having them signup and collect those email addresses to a mail chimp list that I already maintain. From there I could auto respond with the location / date / time and probably a way for them to add to their calendar. Sound about right?</p></div>

Basically they came to us and asked for a LoopBack presenter.</p><p>As to why you didn't get a notification, there was a mistake with the timezone due to Paris entering/exiting/whatever DST.</p><p>If you do Google Hangouts on AIR, folks can RSVP and specify if/when they would like to get warned.</p></div>
