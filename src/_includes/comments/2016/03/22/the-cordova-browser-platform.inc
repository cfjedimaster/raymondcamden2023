		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for this post Raymond. FYI: I logged a JIRA bug report on the subject of the Cordova documentation makes NO mention of "Browser" platform support a few days ago.  I got a "thanks for telling us - we have never documented this" but no sense that it would be addressed at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rather off topic:  I have an older existing web application for which I want to write mobile friendly screens.  I could write some HTML/CSS/js screens (putting them into a mobile app using PG), using jQuery to call the existing server functions, or, write mobile specific screens (in addition to the existing old-school screens) and just keep everything on the IIS web server.</p><p>For several reasons I am leaning towards the latter approach.  However, I would like a web app (essentially a welcome/log-in page) so that it could be part of the Google and Apple application world.  That is, the app logs you in but you then are experiencing the web site.</p><p>Do you have any articles that cover this?  (sorry for the long post).</p><p>Thank you</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, I believe I have the gist.  Your mobile pages are part of your codebase that is PG'd into an app.  The js requests data, and the server side code was modified to serve back data in JSON for this purpose.</p><p>My quest would be to not write client side pages, but rather write the new pages on the server, albeit in a \Mobile directory.  These new pages would make the same calls that the non-Mobile friendly pages currently do.  When a mobile device hits the website everything is beautiful as they are directed to the \Mobile directory.</p><p>However, I want this as an app so that I can put it into an app store.  So my thinking was to have a 1 pager PG'd into an app, but when the user went past the app greeting screen they were actually web browsing the site.  Am I over-complicating things?  I could simply load my site up with one of the PG browser components once thru the front door of the app?</p><p>Thank you</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In general - most folks don't do "if your from a mobile browser, go to this subdirectory" anymore. You can, but I don't think I'd recommend that. If you want to use "just regular web pages", I'd look at a responsive design so your main dot com works well in multiple form factors.</p><p>As to your second idea - again - you *can* make a PG app hit a URL and browse there, but I would not recommend that either. It "works", but is clunky and not really intended use of the app platform. (Apple may even reject it.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are some issues with using the browser platforms as a way to test the apps though - first, it does not have the same cordova.js that say android and iOS apps will have. This could put off frameworks like Ionic that rely on cordova.js to get the platform that the app is running on, to display the UI.</p><p>Also, the plugin support on browsers is also not 100% uniform. If you are using it as a way to test your apps, would you rather have a better, working Ripple platform - with things like live reload, hot module replacement, debuggability, plugin simulation, etc ?</p><p>Plugin simulate could be particularly interesting - instead of giving you real data, the UI could have ways for you to "mock" the return values. The mocks could double up as objects in a test code. </p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>These are definitely valid concerns, and I think I brought them up - except for cordova.js differences. To be fair, that's how *all* platforms are - the cordova.js for Android is not the same as iOS is not the same as Windows - etc.</p><p>If I were doing Ionic only, I'd probably just use ionic serve, but honestly, I don't care if the UI breaks typically. Normally I'm more worried about some other aspect, so if the UI defaults to the wrong platform, I'm ok with that.</p><p>Ripple: I like Ripple, I'm happy there is some life in it, but right now, the browser platform seems a bit more stable. I'm not sure why you say debugging is Ripple only, you can definitely debug w/ the Browser platform, and as for "platform simulation", thats kind of what is going on here too anyway.</p><p>For example, you say "the UI could have ways for you to "mock" the return values", but that's *exactly* what I said it does in some regards - like the barcode plugin.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For the mock part, some plugins allow mocking, others don't. I think the confusion here is - is browser a testing platform, or a real deployment platform - and all plugins need to be consistent with that.</p><p>If it is indeed a testing platform, do we need a "platform" specifically for testing ? Testing on code as real as possible is the best option, and maybe mocking iOS and Android builds should be the way to go ?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think a lot depends on how you build, what you build, etc. For me, a lot of my experience has been with doing "Cordova + X", for example, a camera demo showing some other library. In my case, I know the camera works. I don't care if I'm faking it with a input[type=file]. So for me, the Browser platform could be really useful.</p><p>Did you know Ripple was - kinda - relaunching? You may want to check with them before replacing it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, thank you! But no, it didn't simulate the vibration. Anyway navigator.vibrate is returning "true" so I assume it's doing what it should. AVD emulator neither seem to even mention vibrating. Strange that I haven't find in any website people trying to test that feature, since there's a module for it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had no idea you could build a Cordova app natively to run in the browser!!  This is going to save me so much time!</p><p>One quick note about the 'filewatcher' utility.  I found that the command you used did not watch the root of the www folder -- it only watched the subdirectories underneath the www folder.  So when I changed my index.html file, it would not automatically catch that and run the "cordova prepare browser" command.</p><p>So I changed the filewatcher command to the following:<br>filewatcher -s -l "www/*.* www/**/*.*" "cordova prepare browser"</p><p>This watches the root of the www folder in addition to the subdirectories inside the www folder.  The -l option (that's a lower case L) makes filewatcher list out each file it's watching (which could be a long list, so feel free to leave that one out if you want to) and the -s option makes it display "Watching" with a spinny asterisk-looking thing next to it, instead of a blank line, so you know it's actually still running and hasn't locked up.  That's literally just a cosmetic thing, so feel free to leave off the -s parameter if you don't want that.</p><p>Thanks for this post! It's been very helpful!</p></div>
