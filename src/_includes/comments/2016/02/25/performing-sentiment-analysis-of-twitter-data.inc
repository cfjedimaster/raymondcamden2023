		<div class="comment_text"><p>As I mentioned in the CFML slack, I tested it with 'Scottish Independence', which brought back general Twitter user sentiment of 45.2% negative and 54.8% positive. The most interesting thing about that is that it almost exactly equaled the exact result of the independence referendum - the actual result was 44.7% for and 55.3% against - in reverse.</p><p>Again the interesting thing about that result is that during and after the whole campaign it seemed to almost everyone that the Yes campaign would win because of the strength of the online presence of the Yes campaign. Sadly reality didn't pan out like that but the data provided by this experiment is, as I said, interesting nonetheless!</p></div>
