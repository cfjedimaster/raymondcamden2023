		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sigh... Event though we migrated to Node after more than 10 years CF development a couple of years back. A fantastically easy transition by the way, even for a very large platform.  I always kept my soft spot for CF.  It had its flaws and quirks, but overall most people that gave CF an honest try could see it as good tool for building web apps and I could counter to misconceptions about CF with conviction.</p><p>Sadly like you and Adam, I no longer believe in CF or it viability over even the next couple of years.   I think by now Adobe has managed to isolate every CF single supporter through years of horrible product management.   My theory is that Adobe is fully dedicated to milking the final value of the government  / Defense Contractor install base.  Couple years back I had conversations with some of their business folks and they were making a hefty profit off CF.  Since those orgs move at snails pace Adobe will keep pretending to release new versions with the least amount of effort until those licenses dry up before giving up the ghost.  But for the rest of us CF is dead.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"It was the norm, not the exception, for forum posts to be ignored." It seems like a trend... ...and about the doc... oh my... well.<br>I started downloading coldfusion yesterday (I'm in the middle of the process of trying new tools). But I was fresh out of an installation VS2015, and then I realized that... no. CF is so "niche". Basically what I want to do (moving to a new workflow) will be easier out of the Adobe ecosystem. And that's a sad statement.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, thanks for the writeup, including the pros and cons.</p><p>George: sorry but you're "theory" is wrong (that the only folks still using it are "the government / Defense Contractor install base", and that for "the rest of us it's dead"). I know you sincerely believe that, and others parrot such sentiment. But it's just wrong.</p><p>How can I say that so confidently? Am I a misguided Adobe shill?</p><p>No, I'm a consultant who serves CF folks all day every day as an independent consultant, serving folks something like a doctor helping them solve problems and make the most of CF (just like there are such consultants in about any IT field).</p><p>And on top of about a thousand clients the past 10 years, I can report that I have had at least a hundred new clients in the last year alone, who are not only using CF (and it's significant to them), but they're using or have upgraded to CF11 (just to show it's not all just people "keeping it alive on old versions that they don't want to pay to upgrade").</p><p>But the key point, in reply to your theory, is that NONE of them are defense contractors, and only a few are in federal govt. The rest range from small to huge, commercial to non-profit, and everything in between.</p><p>So please stop perpetuating this myth that somehow those two groups you mention are the only folks using CF anymore. It just is NOT true.</p><p>Anyway, I don't begrudge people who choose to move on to something else, but I wish they would all slow their roll in wanting to pronounce to the world that CF is dead, or even dying. It's definitely not dead, and even whether it's dying is just an opinion (and really, just a matter of perspective).</p><p>Is it maturing? Sure. All technology does. Heck, some are declaring PHP's long in the tooth, or that Apple is in trouble, which again is just about perspective. But the people asserting such things believe it to be absolutely so, whether it truly is or not.</p><p>Is CF facing challenges for the reasons Ray pointed out? Sure. And it's troubling, but not enough to be the "final nail in the coffin", whatever prognosticators think.  I say this as someone on the ground, interacting with more CF shops than about anyone out there.</p><p>And should that day ever come that Adobe DID abandon it (which I don't see coming, because as you said it is profitable for Adobe), or for those who don't like giving money to Adobe, there are of course the other open source CFML engines. And there are certainly many other platforms to choose from if people do finally get totally fed up with CFML. You guys are there, and that's cool.</p><p>But please just don't make it like "nobody uses CF" anymore. It just is not true. Or that "the only people using it are stuck doing so". That's also just not true. Plenty of people either love it (but don't feel compelled to shout it from the rooftops) or they just do it as their job (and go home at the end of the day, also making no noise about it).</p><p>What we hear from mostly these days are people, often who have moved off of it, ringing the death knell. It may be "dead to you" (in the relationship sense"), or even "dead to the world" (in terms of overall IT popularity), but it's not dead in the sense that "no one uses it", or as you say except only lumbering federal agencies and contractors. That is just a myth, and an unfair one to perpetuate. And my contemporary experience absolutely counters it.</p></div>

See the support matrix here:</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fpdf%2Fcoldfusion2016-support-matrix.pdf%3AcMp50esoQt7CnjSw5WoluOJjahs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://helpx.adobe.com/pdf/coldfusion2016-support-matrix.pdf">https://helpx.adobe.com/pdf...</a></p><p>And yes, Adobe did in fact update CF11 to work with IIS 10, though it seems you missed it (in Nov 2015). It was CF11 update 7 and CF10 update 18. More at:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.coldfusion.com%2Fpost.cfm%2Fcoldfusion-11-update-7-and-coldfusion-10-update-18-are-now-available%3AgdEIkXj6IPAqbsgfVPh8qjYT9N4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/coldfusion-11-update-7-and-coldfusion-10-update-18-are-now-available">http://blogs.coldfusion.com...</a></p><p>It was also mentioned in the update mechanism, for those that keep an eye on that. But it would be in the interest of anyone running CF to follow that Adobe blog, as they do share such info (and not much other fluff) there.</p><p>Hope that's helpful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i'm a little late here but still want to ask if somebody knows about this:<br>I installed Coldfusion 2016 (developer edition) on Windows 10 / IIS 10.<br>I setup the websites as usual and created the CF virtual directories with the "CF Web Server Configuration Tool".<br>Also I modified the hosts file with my local hosts..<br>But now I still can't access the websites in the browser. I receive either error 401.3 (that i have not enough rights) or 500.19..<br>Does somebody know what I can do? maybe something is missing in "Windows Programs and Features" for CF2016. Does somebody know the requirements there? thanks!</p></div>

I'd even say that if I couldn't solve this problem in less than an hour, you would not pay for any of the time. I'm afraid I can't propose all the possible explanations here.</p><p>This would be done via safe, secure shared desktop access (no need for you to grant me remote access, nor create an account, nor open any firewall holes). If you're interested, see the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carehart.org%2Fconsulting%3AfFTFQ74cxTTc_ncGk_lTxSSKNko&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.carehart.org/consulting">www.carehart.org/consulting</a>.

I started and ended with free resources. I only posed the direct help because some problems are simply too complicated (too many variables, and likely something very environmentally-specific) to resolve easily in blog comments like this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you're whole article is worth the read, however, I wanted to comment about "your little secret". I don't know what that was like for you to make that public, however, thank you for doing so. My son is borderline autistic (some say "on the spectrum") and you just helped me understand him a little better. I would encourage more people to speak up about things like this, because it brings us all a bit closer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I remember reading this a while back, thinking it explained a lot, about myself.  Though never diagnosed in my family, I and my son have what appears to be social anxiety.  His has been crippling.  He is better as a 35 year old adult.  The diagnosis of high functioning autism didn't really exist then.  I never heard of Asperger's until I saw Boston Legal.</p><p>There are many work tasks I struggle with.  I work in a cube environment with interruptions every 15 minutes while I try to code.  I had one just now, and derailed the frustration by looking for this old blog post I read.  I took one of those online autism test yesterday and scored pretty high.  Who knows, you might have something there about coders being on the spectrum.  :)</p></div>
