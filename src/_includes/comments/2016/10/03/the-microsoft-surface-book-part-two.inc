		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had my SB for a couple of months now and I generally like it. It's connected via the Surface Dock to a pair of LG 34" external monitors. I disable the SB display in this configuration. Works great. However, disconnecting the SB from the Dock to take the SB mobile results in some resolution issues for running apps. The SB prompts me to log out and log back in again to correct the problem. The reverse is also true, when reconnecting to the dock and going back to dual external monitors. App window size is weird (usually tiny windows with hugely outsized contents) and seemingly randomly placed across the monitors.  Icon arrangement on the desktop randomly switches around, too. I'd think there'd be a mapping somewhere in the OS that would keep track of the monitor configurations and app and desktop icon locations and ensure things get restored as reasonably as possible.  This user experience, however, clearly needs some attention!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So not exactly scientific testing, but when I disconnected, everything was fine. Some windows needed to be maximized since they were big enough on the external monitor but not the SB screen. And when I reconnected, the same - I had some apps I had full screened that I then reduced in size.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You mentioned GitHub and Dropbox for backing up development projects... why not BitBucket? It's free for unlimited private repositories. It's fabulous, and SourceTree is very nice too, which works well with it (though you can of course use any Git client). Come to think of it, most Atlassian stuff is (no I don't work for them). :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not saying it makes sense, but I just don't feel right making a repo for every dumb thing I make. Maybe I need to get over it. For my Cordova demos, I made *one* repo and use a bunch of folders, but even then, I put things that end up in blog posts there.</p><p>Maybe I can start a new repo for "RandomWebShit" to cover my HTML/JS experimentation.</p></div>
