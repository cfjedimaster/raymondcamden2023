		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond...this is one of the best articles I have read about this device.  I get so tired of reading things that sound like they are copy and pasted from one review to another ( so so unoriginal they are) and this was very entertaining as well and some good down to earth information and user feedback!  Here are a couple of things I wish you would have talked about, and maybe I missed it...but what you think of the hinge gap and moving the device around the house for work and travel, i.e. size and portability and lapability?  Did you have any problems with it?  (I read horror stories about it but we all know there are a lot of people who don't even know how to turn ON a computer so we should all take those with a grain of salt!)  AND...could you use this or will you be using this as your daily driver?  Great article..Im jealous you got to test and review it!  Wish I had that opportunity you had. HINT HINT MICROSOFT!  Call me! <br>Thanks a lot once again</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the kind words. :)</p><p>Keep in mind my normal laptop is the 15 inch MBP, so the SB is definitely lighter and easier to port around. If you are *coming* from a 13 inch model though it may not be the same.</p><p>As for my 'daily driver' - still figuring that out. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Shrug - it's different - it looks cool - but... it's a hinge. Not sure how folks could feel *anything* about it if you get my meaning.</p></div>
