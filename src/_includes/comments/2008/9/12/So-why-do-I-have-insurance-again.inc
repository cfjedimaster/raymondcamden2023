		<div class="comment_text"><p>I feel for you man, I do, but the cynical part of me can't help but think that people who choose to live in disaster zones like NOLA in a sense deserve what they get. Kinda like building your house on the side of a mountain in a major earthquake area, then being all upset when your house comes down in the quake.</p><p>I know you're not one of them, but how many times do some of these people need to lose everything before they say, "Hey, maybe this isn't the best place to live."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When some damnfool trashed the driver-side mirror on my car a few years ago I had a similar moment. $350 damage, $500 deductible -- I was out of pocket for the whole thing. Kind of annoying.</p><p>Although to be fair, when another damnfool rear-ended the car and the repair bill was close to 5K, Allstate paid without a problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The answer to Anonymous's question, for me at least, was once. I lost my home and everything in it to Katrina. Dealing with the insurance agencies then was a real barrel of laughs... Good luck Ray. Oh, and if you really serious, when you talk to your insurance company be sure to mention that you think they are operating in "bad faith."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm feeling you. Insurance at times seems such a waste of money. There have been some times in the past where I never bought car insurance and I would have no issues for the whole year but there are times I would have insurance and totally get screwed cause the other person wasn't paying attention. I like to live on the edge sometimes. Keeps the blood flowing.</p><p>Maybe have a "Donate to my house fund" on your page? Instead of wishlist stuff you get money for your place. Just an idea. Some guy want a new macbook and had a button on his site and people paid man. you should try it.</p></div>

And even more sorry to hear that your wife doesn't love you enough to let you get the bigger TV. :-) I was pretty shocked when mine agreed to the 65" monster we have, although there are still times that she looks at it and says, "It's just too big."</p><p>And to @Anonymous: You've already been called out as an a$$hole, which you clearly are ... but Max forgot to also point out that you're a coward, too. At least man up enough to not post anonymously. And by the way, if you're a regular reader of Ray's blog, you now owe him a big fat check for all of the free help he's offered you, you ungrateful SOB. I know that Ray doesn't mind providing the help, but you could at least have the grace to say "thank you" and "I feel your pain", instead of showing your true colors.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Honestly, I agree a bit with Anonymous. Not so much for  coastal cities, but people who live on flood plains, fault lines, etc, where it's pretty much guaranteed their house is going to have serious damage every few years. All in all, most hurricanes just don't do that much damage.</p><p>And it's only right that insurance costs more and has higher deductibles in higher risk areas, including coastal cities.</p><p>What I really wonder, though -- when the state changed the deductible for hurricane damage (do they even have a right to modify the terms of a contract between two private entities in that way??), did your insurance company adjust your payments to account for the tremendously increased deductible?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - boy I feel for you man. With me, it's health insurance. When you're self-employed, and have had ANY health problems at all in your life, you are pretty much stuck with what the state guarantees, and that is generally very high deductible, high co-pay. So I avoid going to the doctor's much more than I should as I know unless something serious happens, it's all coming out of my pocket...even though I've already had to pay $4K+ for the coverage! Sucks big time.</p><p>I also agree that I think anonymous was talking more about living someplace where disasters are kind of commonplace. I have to admit, I never particularly understood that myself (we just really don't have many problems where I live), but then look at all the people that retire to Florida! Every time a hurricane came through there we had to worry about my grandmom in her little mobile home. Often it's the places that are the nicest to live 99% of the time that are at the highest risk.</p></div>
