		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good to know you're ok. I just rode out Tropical Storm Fay (live in Port St. Lucie, FL).  And we're now expecting possibly Hannah, Ike, and Josephine...Had some water damage myself. Luckily it's a new structure and the builder is fixing it (some bad caulking). No flooding by us, but many people had new swimming pools around the city.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to see you're ok.</p><p>We teach ColdFusion to some of our students who work in our computer labs at our University.  This should come in handy not only for teaching purposes, but also to let the students continue using ColdFusion on their own after the classes are over.</p></div>
