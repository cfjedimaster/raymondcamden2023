		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I was young I got in trouble with a group of other kids and we were told we had to write some sentence over and over 500 times (you know, something like "I will not be an annoying kid"). So the next day everyone brought in their handwritten papers and I brought in a printout that my dad had made me on some old dot matrix printer that printed the sentence 500 times. I don't think that got me out of trouble, but it certainly taught me to never put up with repetitive BS when you don't have to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>lol.  I don't think it's cheating at all.  The assignment was something the child was supposed to do with their parent(s).  Whether this is the first time you've exposed your son to CF programming, or you've done it before in the past, this proves that you're helping to improve his learning skills which I'm assuming is the whole point of the assignment.</p><p>If he goes on to learn programming (whether in CF or something else) and you've helped give him the nudge he needs, is that a bad thing?</p><p>Hopefully the teacher/professor will see it the same way :).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>IMHO it is not cheating as you walked your son through the code and he understands the steps needed to solve the problem and he could apply those steps at a future date without access to a computer (albeit in a more time consuming way).</p><p>As you say he had found one on his own, learned that random guessing was not the most efficient method to solve the problem, and that using the right tool (computer  programming) can save time - time that can be used to finish other homework.</p><p>By the way, I work for a K-12 distance education organization and find that students whose parents play an active part in their children's education generally do much better :-).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&lt;rant&gt;<br>Heh, it's this sort of thinking that made programming a reality in the first place. Afterall, what really is technology other than finding cheaper, faster, and more efficient ways to get more accurate results? As long as our kids learns the foundations that these technologies rely on, then kudos to those who use technology to accomplish their goals!</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>LOL, this is great. It actually reminds me of when I was a kid and had a similar situation where the problem was extremely difficult in a repetitive way and parents were supposed to help. In hindsight, I've thought how inconsiderate the teacher was, for student and parent, to assign such a time-consuming assignment. After all, not everyone's parents are programmers, and there's no reason they or their children should be penalized for that.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p></div>
