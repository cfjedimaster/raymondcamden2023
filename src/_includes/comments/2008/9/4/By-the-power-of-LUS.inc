		<div class="comment_text"><p>yeah, good to hear things went pretty ok for a hurricane.  Having grown up in FL and been through a few myself, let me just say, I prefer the variety of hurricane that comes in a glass.</p><p>Now comes Ike and he's looking strong, might have relatives staying with me if they have to evacuate south FL.</p><p>DK</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi from down the road in New Iberia. We did fine also, and I have to say that one reason is that after Lily we cut out the big water oak in the back yard. Live oaks seem to do pretty well, but those water oaks, yikes!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray<br>I watched your video clips - pretty cool.  As someone who has survived a few tornadoes I must agree that the whole power outage thing after the storm really does suck.  On a related note it also looks like we both studied at the Blair Witch Film Academy.<br>Glad you guys are ok!  I have a family of five too and that is a major pain when you have to restock 400 dollars of groceries.  At least insurance will help out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Two kind of funny/interesting mail related notes:</p><p>1) The US Mail actually went out on Tuesday and Wednesday. I couldn't believe it when I saw the mail man driving down my road on Tuesday. I mean even though things were calm then, there were -many- road closures.</p><p>2) I had a UPS package that was to be delivered on Wednesday. I certainly didn't expect it, but I found this note in the tracking info pretty funny:</p><p>Delay in delivery due to external factors</p><p>Yes, external factors as in a big honkin' hurricane. ;) (To their credit, the package is arriving today, all of one day late.)</p></div>
