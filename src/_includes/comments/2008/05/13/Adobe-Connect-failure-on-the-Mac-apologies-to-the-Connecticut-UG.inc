		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not to start a flame war here, but I really don't care for the Connect/Breeze product.  I understand the need for it for giving live presentations, but for recorded presentations, I would rather not have to sit through a poll and watch people post messages.  Isn't there a way to just show the video for recorded presentations?  At least then, it won't resize my Firefox window.</p><p>There are too many CF/Flex presentations on the web that are in this format.  Why?  How come I can watch screencasts recorded by individuals with nothing more than software like SnapzPro or iShowU that are of higher quality with better audio and video?  Is it Flash itself?  Does Adobe prevent presentations in other formats?  Does Breeze/Connect support h.264?  Do I have the capability to download a flash video and watch it offline?</p><p>It gets very annoying when I try to watch an Adobe sponsored presentation for some ColdFusion or Flex topic and I can barely watch it because of the choppy audio or video from Connect.  Please Adobe, after the presentation is over, go back and make a real screencast in a high quality format.</p><p>By the way Ray, you could use iChat for presentations.  Not sure of the limit, but I think you can connect up to 3 people at a time.  And you can record your presentation.  It will ask the other people in iChat for their permission.  When the presentation is over, it saves your audio chats as AAC files and video chats in mpeg-4 files.</p><p>Ok, I'm done. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just an OT observation.  When m$ windows flakes out people love to point out how crappy it is (myself included), but when a mac is the culprit there seems to be no fault.  Is it that mac users just expect things not to work all the time?  Like your comment Ray: "but mainly just random crashes 2-3 times an hour" - you say that like that's ok.</p><p>I've seen a few of these presentations go south when the presenter was on a mac.  Maybe you guys could sell your mac toys and buy a big-boy computer? :)</p><p>For the record, vista sucks just as bad as any mac OS.</p></div>
