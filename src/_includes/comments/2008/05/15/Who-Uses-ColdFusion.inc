		<div class="comment_text"><p>What happened was a new CIO started and came from an environment where he had 100+ dotNet devs and didnt really understand CF and pretty much made his mind up that CF was not enterprise enough which I and the rest of the CF community know is not true.</p><p>The end result was a decision behind closed doors that made the entire CF redundant :( :(</p><p>Thankfully most have got new roles, but CF was deemed a hobbyist language and anyone who had any relation to it would be replaced by dotNet developers.</p><p>One of the calssic arguments being that CF costs to much etc...that old line.<br>I pointed relevant peeps at various presentations by Cutter and Forta outlining CF and its benefits but the decision was made and that was that.</p><p>So the current situation is a complete replacement of the cf team with c#.net developers. The fireing process included 5 permenant members of staff.</p></div>
