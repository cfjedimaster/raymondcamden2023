		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm sure those tips will help some folks, Ray. Thanks for sharing. Since your blog gets so many readers, I'd like to just throw out there that these and dozens more such tips can also be found with still further explanation in my my 4-part series of articles on the monitor at the Adobe Dev Center, starting at:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fdevnet%2Fcoldfusion%2Farticles%2Fmonitoring_pt1.html%3AECT9lLHcuFq09srYOi4-gDEggJk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/monitoring_pt1.html">http://www.adobe.com/devnet...</a></p><p>I realize some (including Ray) may have read them and could have not noticed these little gems at the time, or may have forgotten them since. There was a lot to digest and there's certainly never anything wrong with repeating them.</p><p>Just saying that if anyone has other challenges with using the CF8 monitor, or just wants to learn more about what it can do beyond the obvious, that's the point of the series. It even covers some things not discussed in any docs I found. Hope that's helpful.</p></div>
