		<div class="comment_text"><p>Walking on a treadmill. For me this was great as I couldn't use weather as an excuse. I have been increasing the speed for a while now. I do 30 minutes. 5 minutes at a light job and 5 minutes at a steep incline. All in all I walk about 2.1 miles five days a week.</p><p>M/W/F I do pushups - on my knees - but I can now do a grand total of 3 "real" pushups. I also do stomach crunches as well. To be honest, if i didn't lose another pound I'd be happy, but I really want my stomach flatter. Not flat. Just flatter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congratulations Ray.  Sounds like you are almost there.  I'll have to stay tuned for CFBL 2.</p><p>Last time I went on a crash diet I dropped 75lbs in about 4-5 months.  However, I've let the good ol' LBs creep back in the last 3-4 years.</p><p>I blame RSS and IDD (Internet Deficit Disorder).  I'm guessing things will be a lot harder this time around now that I've exited my 20's.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice job on the weight loss Ray. I missed out on your CFBL, but my wife did get me to join a gym a few weeks ago and I'm already down a few pounds, the CFBL has been a nice motivator for me, seeing other out of shape programmers get off their butts and losing weight. It's cool seeing results even after just a few weeks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well done Ray!</p><p>I have had a similar experience. Makes me feel good when I wake up in the morning. Lost about 2 stone through CBFL.</p><p>I found that a reasonable amount(1-2 hours a day) of walking is good. Coupled it with resistance sessions in the gym. Eating smaller portions, and eating less potatoes and white bread helped a lot.</p><p>Joel</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Kudos to all the CFBL folks!  I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 3 years ago.  The doc put me on a strict low carb/low cal diet (as I sit in front of a computer all day long) coupled with a low impact exercise regimen. In three years I have dropped 75 lbs and managed to keep it off (from 250 to 175/170 depending on the day).  The stomach still isn't as "flat" as I'd like either - so I hear ya on that one Ray - just know it can be worked on.</p><p>Again - Congrats to ya'll.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lighthouse Pro will not work with BlueDragon out of the box, but with a few quick changes, you can get it working:</p><p>1) In Application.cfc, on line 134:</p><p>        &lt;cfschedule action="update" task="#taskname#" operation="HTTPRequest" url="#taskurl#" startDate="1/1/1999" startTime="12:00 AM" interval="600" requestTimeOut="600"&gt;</p><p>All you need to do is change the start date to 4 digits, and viola.</p><p>2) On the project_view.cfm page, around like 181:  Look in the javascript for the function "displayData".  All the JSON data coming back from CF7/8 is uppercase.  BD for whatever silly reason, decided to do them lowercase.  Simple change the case of all references to DATA.whatever in here and you're good to go!</p></div>
