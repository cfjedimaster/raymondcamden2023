		<div class="comment_text"><p>It could most definitely be done easier... where is the graphical IDE for this stuff? Compare editing databases with graphical UI to doing everything in code. (Especially relationships.) I will enjoy seeing what Joe or someone can do with AIR or another tool to come up to speed on this way of making it easier.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not with Model Glue. Someone should do a YouTube or hook up with Charlie on that if it can do the job. It would be a big boost for the MG community. :)</p><p>Later we may extend D2O to support some of those types of features... but that will be after 1.0 for sure. I think it is the way all of our IDE tools should move when able. We need some more advanced tools that go beyond text editing. Of course keep the text stuff friendly. This is a great post on that. My long term concern is always not what can be done friendly... but rather what won't be. (standard programmer paranoia.)</p></div>
