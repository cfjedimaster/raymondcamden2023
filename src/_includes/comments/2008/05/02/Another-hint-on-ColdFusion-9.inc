		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Paul... learn Flex / Actionscript and you will start to understand. Or learn JS and DOM and that might help. CF started (in some peoples opinion) a good thing with version 5 and script. Yet, the feature set has always been limited. This means the full argument for the benefits (not exclusive use) of script cannot be made. We do get more and more with each version and the arguments are getting better as the script gets better.</p><p>@Dale... I think there is still a good place for tags. Uniquely the concept that CFCs are not a place where you should require tags is a good thing IMO. Tags are great for view based logic.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK, it seems a group of developers who do CF and Flex love ActionScript even more than CFScript.

This should have been in 6 and every year never seems to make it.<br>-Expand CFExchange giving access to setup and manage accounts not just use them. Another automation tool CF lacks. I wonder how many developers building big systems out there want to have to manually key in every request to make a mailbox.<br>-CFDeploy, another huge automation feature that doesn't exist. This takes a zip file deploys it to a specified location AND can automaticly can set application variables to make the site useful in an automated envirnoment.<br>-Force Flash to add the Flash Remoting libary back into Flash so developer can use CF web services in their apps again. It assumes quite a bit to think everyone uses Flex or is willing to use AS2 and take a huge performance hit to use Flash Remoting. This is one of the worst release decsions I've seen ever.</p><p>With out these features any upgrades for CF are worthless to me</p><p>- CF8 Enterprise Developer</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>1. I'm building an online service with CF8 Ent now and I've been searching high and low for ways to automate site creation for trial/paying users. There are a couple of questional custom tags out there, and they all go well out of the scope of XML to get the job done. I'm also on IIS 6. Specially since I'm an enterprise developer, I really expect CF to cover me on being able to automate processes. After all thats what programming is all about. Right now its a HUGE hole in our app. If CFIIS was the only feature in CF9, its enough for us to upgrade. Its that important to our project.</p><p>2. Yeah there are tools out there, but like CFImage, its time to get with the times. Some things just make sense to have in there.</p><p>3. I've been searching since AS3 release for Flash Remoting solutions for Flash CS3/4. After so much searching and I've had encounters with many other developers with the same gripes that claim the reason it doesn't work is the libaries don't exist and thats why the same classes that work in Flex don't work in Flash. I have CF8 WACK all 3 books, and it covers it in the Flex sense, it does not crack an .fla and show you how in AS3. All the demos seem to be like this everywhere, and it has a lot of devlopers frustrated. There are a couple that haven't, but they also don't work.</p><p>Outside of the automation tools and the Flash issue, which I think is Flash after talking with the dev team at MAX, CF has been great for me until I got into complete automated site deployment and management.</p><p>I dropped my real e-mail this time. Let me know if you know of anything that can help me out in that department.</p></div>

Seriously - Adobe pays attention to the form and will at least process it.</p><p>3) Maybe I don't quite get your issue here then. I remember working on a chapter for the WACK that did a quick FR test using a simple FLA to show movie titles. It has been a while, but I seem to remember. Flash Remoting, as far as I know, has NEVER been Flex only. FR _predates_ Flex, so I'm not sure how it could be.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Shawn,</p><p>FYI, in CFWACK back in CFMX days we did indeed have a chapter on using Flash Remoting and ActionScript to connect to ColdFusion from Flash. That was before Flex days. Since Flex was released most ColdFusion coverage has moved from CF/Flash to CF/Flex because, well, Flex is typically more appealing to coders like CFers. The same CFC calls via Flash Remoting can be invoked from Flex or Flash, at the end of the day it's the same Flash Player. But, yes, there is going to be far less content out there on using Flash versus Flex.</p><p>--- Ben</p></div>

Between 1 and 2, that means our new app as complex as it is, it can be completely built and automated from CF and that makes me happy and says a lot about the platform.</p><p>3. Yeah, from my experience even though they should be interchangable, they aren't. At first I thought maybe I was crazy and just wasn't finding it, but then as time went on I found a lot of people with the same issues and at MAX I asked a lot of questions and Adobe developers wouldn't confirm or deny, all I got was "NetConnection has to be reworked in a future version of Flash."</p><p>PS - Yeah I was a closed Beta tester for CF8 and x64 and I didn't want to get my app shot down for Centaur cause they know I'm bringing all the automation complaints.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also to comment on Flex/Flash and Coldfusion. I've been a Flash developer since 1999 and a CF developer since 2001. Flex is pretty good on the CMS side, and to mimic that in Flash would be a lot of work so, I do agree Flex is something to be excited over, but our client's require way too much customization on their projects and Flash is that ultimate tool for building "whatever" they need down to the pixel, and CF is our data component to it. Its really important that Flash keeps its flexibility in that regard, so I hope the community doesn't leave it behind.</p><p>Thanks for all the interaction by the way.</p></div>
