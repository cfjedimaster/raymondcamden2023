		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love Eclipse but Eclipse does not manage all my connections and site defs. DW CS4 has to be the best release so far, it fits perfectly with Adobe's other products and I love the new dual screen function.:) the only issue with CS4 is some CF8 tags were missing and i has to download a plug-in. you would think a newer version would have been up-to-date.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Francois: To be fair, I didn't buy DW, but 400 is not expensive. It may be for a college kid (although I'm sure they have educational discounts), but for a serious development tool, it's very fairly priced. Good tools are worth paying for.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Note: Students can get the entire Web standard suite at their universities for +- $250 (includes Fireworks and Flash).</p><p>$400, for a career developer, on a tool that will save you measurable amounts of time (assuming you actually learn how to use it), enhance your productivity, and make your full-time job more enjoyable, is a bargain.</p><p>The argument that your company not paying for something is an excuse not to use it to me seems a little limiting. It's your life. Probably 8 hours a weekday of your life. That's roughly 36% of all of the time you spend awake. To not invest some of the money you make at that job into improving your enjoyment and performance at that job is, well, self-deprecating on so many levels.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice to hear some positive comments about DW. I've been using it for years (in code view, mostly) and saving time all along. My buddies who don't use it are amazed whenever I show them a little nugget of the power of DW. They still don't think it's "cool" to use it though, so I happily finish work early while they work into the wee hours...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love DWCS4.  The linking of files is simply too cool.  If I'm working in an HTML file the linked CSS and JS files show on a sub menu.  I can easily toggle between all the linked files without manually opening each one.  Make a change in one and it automatically appears in the live preview.  Slick.  I haven't seen the unobtrusive js development yet, but will investigate more.</p><p>I just have a question.  I'd like to add a new keyboard shortcut but it won't let me.  I want to add CTRL-A to add &lt;CFABORT&gt; but I can't add a menu item to the keyboard dropdown.  Is that possible?</p></div>
