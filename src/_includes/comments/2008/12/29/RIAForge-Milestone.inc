		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been inflating your statistics. ;)</p><p>I log in every day to check the comments on my blogs, just because I'm not getting the email notifications... I don't mind, just saying. :)</p><p>Granted, I also watch the # downloads on my projects every day. Makes me feel good to see those roughly 2-3 downloads per day on my two main projects. Feels like I'm really contributing something of value to the community. :)</p><p>I also grab a calculator and do the quick math of dividing the number of downloads by the number of views (conversion rate). If you have an extra minute, that might be a cool stat to add -- that and possibly average downloads per day since the project was created. Just 'cause those are both easy calculations based on data that's already in the RIAForge db.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congrats on the new milestone! As far as the monitoring app, have you ever tried Nagios? <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nagios.org%2F%3AV6K83rf29IPQKTfqtRMEShNSrks&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nagios.org/">http://www.nagios.org/</a> It's what we use at work, and we moved to that from Servers Alive (probably for similar reasons!).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I agree it's not very obvious. I guess the closest they come to saying it's free is at the bottom of their about page:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nagios.org%2Fabout%2F%3AKtFcrTWRGBLctLEsHhtDK3-bH3k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nagios.org/about/">http://www.nagios.org/about/</a></p><p>    *  Open Source Software<br>    * Full access to source code<br>    * Released under the GPL license</p><p>I just verified with our network engineer that runs it that it is free software.</p></div>
