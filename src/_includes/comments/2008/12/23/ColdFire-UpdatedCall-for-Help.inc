		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just to follow up a bit on what Ray said above, what I'm hoping to do is add something like ServiceCapture to Firebug. At this point it is just an idea. I'm actually not sure it's even possible with Mozilla's scriptable (JavaScript) interfaces, but it is something I'm exploring. While I'm looking at the BlazeDS code now, this is my first deep dive into AMF, so if anyone has experience parsing AMF and would like to lend a hand that would be great.</p><p>Also, if you would like to see what can currently be done with Flex and ColdFire check out my latest blog post: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mischefamily.com%2Fnathan%2Findex.cfm%2F2008%2F12%2F23%2FDebugging-Flex-with-ColdFire%3AaAoA5FPwJbxhgPBCWTtZmR3r7_w&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mischefamily.com/nathan/index.cfm/2008/12/23/Debugging-Flex-with-ColdFire">http://www.mischefamily.com...</a></p></div>
