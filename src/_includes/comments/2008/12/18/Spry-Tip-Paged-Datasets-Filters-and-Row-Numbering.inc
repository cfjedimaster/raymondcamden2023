		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Jimmy. Not really sure this is on topic. I replied to the forum there. I was thinking of doing a 'How am I doing' type survey at the end of the year. This is in regards to the person who said my blog was too basic. Most of my content is driven by the questions sent in, so not sure what I can do about that. As to person who said I was writing too much about myself... I'm lost at that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, the description for ds_PageItemNumber used to be accurate up until the point I made it so that the PagedView supported filtering (due to popular request). :-)</p><p>I guess I forgot to update the description after that fix. I'll correct the description in that sample so it doesn't lead people astray.</p></div>
