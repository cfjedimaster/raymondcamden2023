That's an equal indictment of myself and OO there ;-)</p><p>It was an interesting quiz in its intent, but I found the it to be somewhat poor in a few areas:<br>- "none of the above" (the correct answer is that it's none of the other options presented) is a completely difference concept to "pass" (I don't know or am choosing not to answer the question).<br>- Some questions are based on opinion (and Helms' and my opinion differ).<br>- I claim my points for saying "equals()" in Q3, because the Q explicitly says "class", so it's clearly not a CF-oriented question, because CF doesn't have classes, it has CFCs.  *A* "way of determining ~" is definitely to use the equals() method if one implements it in one's classes (say in Java, for argument's sake).<br>- it seems the questions have been updated since Rick's comment: Q25 says "explicit" for me.</p><p>But anyway... it kept me occupied for 5min, I suppose :-)</p><p>-- <br>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't written any CF code in about 3 years, so I'm probably a bit rusty.</p><p>I got 64.something and I have to say that the explanations for the incorrect answers definitely come across as a marketing exercise.</p><p>I counted about 6 questions where I would genuinely agree with Hal that my answer was wrong. Pretty much all of the the rest of the *incorrect* answers were trick questions as indicated by Hal in the explanations. I don't put much value in a quiz that uses tricks to make you pick the wrong answer, so a few demerits for Hal on that front IMHO.</p><p>All in all, an interesting quiz, but very heavily weighted towards people who have read Hals writings and opinions. I'm not saying that Hal's opinions are bad. They are generally very good, but they certainly aren't necessarily widely recognized in the form and language he uses to present them.</p><p>I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the test is designed to make you fail if you don't subscribe to Hal's particular choice of language and perspective. That's fine, but it is important to recognize that Hal's perspective (while well worth listening to) is just that, a perspective not an immutable rule of OO programming.</p></div>

I'm sure the argument can be made that part of an OO lifestyle is becoming familiar with standardized and popular OO design patterns, but at the same time if you're an incredible ColdFusion prodigy it's a lot more appealing to just use the design patterns without studying them, and therefore learning their standardized names.</p><p>Also, answering "There is no such principle" even when I knew there probably was one was REALLY REALLY FUN for some reason.</p><p>Great quiz.

Hell, anyone who scored higher than 85 is now my guru if they weren't before (Michael Steele, fess up - did you google any of the answers?).</p><p>Coupla things suprised me:<br>Q5 decorator pattern: answer was #2 but this is also true for inheritance, mixins, composition, you name it, so it didn't seem specific enough to be the right answer.  I chose #3. Even though I know that's not right it seemed righter.</p><p>Q9 lazy loading: of course you don't to use stub objects to do this, but "loading variables as they are needed" could almost be a definition of variable scoping.</p><p>Q11 Aggregation vs composition: don't get this at all.  does this make sense to anyone else?  I see what Hal's getting at, but firstly I thought it was the other way round (composition implies independant objects, aggregation implies strict lifecycle dependance - as in DDD's "aggregate root") and secondly it's the member that's dependant on the parent, not the reverse.</p><p>Q13 subclass madness: I'd never say a class is a "subclass" of an interface, I'd say "subtype".  Is that just me?</p><p>Q44 what will this code do: LOL.  Sneaky...</p></div>
