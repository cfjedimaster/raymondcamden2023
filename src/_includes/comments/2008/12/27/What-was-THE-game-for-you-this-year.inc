		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agreed, this was a very fun year for gaming.  Out of the many blockbuster titles and highly-anticipated sequels, I think Portal was the one that stands out to me.  Cool story, integrated puzzles and neat graphics without a huge learning curve - which is important because I feel like an 8-bit gamer at heart in this crazy 3D gaming world!</p><p>Halo 3 is fun online button mashing, especially with our east-coast friends.  Did you check out Spore also?  That seems like a very conceptual game that you would digg.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Bliss: Civilization - I was disappointed in some of the design decisions of that game. I think they did a good job translating it to the console, but I hate the fact that there is a turn limit and you can't play past the end of the game. My OCD nature led me (in older Civ games) to completely take over the world and build everything out. You can't do that with the BTS version.</p></div>

Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2 have to be up there as well.</p><p>Fable 2 looks really nice, but at this stage I'm more into games that I can jump into for half an hour or an hour and then put the controller down (willingly).

That being said:</p><p>Fallout 3 - best game of 2008.<br>Fable 2 - very, very good.  But the lack of online/multiplayer killed it.<br>COD5 - not horrible, but not even close to being the game COD4 is. 7 out of 10.<br>Bad Company - fantastic.  <br>Gears2 - excellent, but I got tired of it very quickly.<br>Madden 09 was pretty good, maybe a 7 out of 10.</p><p>Did I miss anything?  All of the above games were played (at least in my house) on a 360.  We have a PS3, but my kids only play the 360, and I can't figure out how to do have the crap on the PS3, so for the most part it simply gets used as a DVD player.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Thomas: Ray, if you do ever unlock the secret to a 36-hour day, let me know. (When some people think about living on Mars, they think of Edgar Rice Burroughs or Ray Bradbury myths. I think of the extra 39 minutes.)</p><p>I have been cutting back on my spending - somewhat - so I don't have some of the new releases I'd otherwise have played (Fable 2, Saints Row 2, KR:AI 2 - don't laugh, I like to sing).</p><p>GTA IV wasn't what I hoped it would be ... there were a lot of annoyances about it that I thought they would have improved from San Andreas. Pretty much all EA sports titles (EA Sports titles?) are disappointments any more. GH World Tour was all right, but a lot more linear than we'd hoped.</p><p>Rock Band 2 is really good. It's the same in a lot of ways as Rock Band, but it added a couple of features and fixed a couple of big issues ... I guess that's THE game for me?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>With all the coding and writing you do for the community, your regular job, and your family, you still had time to spend on gaming?  I get it, you don't sleep.  That is it.</p><p>Anyway, I don't necessarily have much to comment specifically on the games.  My eldest Son is a big WOW fanatic.  The younger two are more game console players, not PC, and to them it has been Guitar Hero, mostly since they have been using my younger son's PS2.  We add a Wii for Christmas, so I expect we will see new games this coming year.  For me, give me the old retro-games of the late 70's and early 80's.  I know their graphics where cheap compared to today, but they were fun to play.  At least some arcades, like the one at Seaside, OR, still have these old games, along with Air Hockey, where you are much more active than just using your thumbs and a few fingers.  At least Wii can get you off your rear-end.  So far, I have only played the bowling game (we got the Sport Pack with the console).</p><p>On the Internet connection standpoint, I was impressed with Wii's out-of-the box connectivity to our Home Wireless setup, with recognizing/handling the updated encryption algorithms.  Something that the Tivo, Series 2, DVR didn't do with its USB adapter.  It was stuck with WEP as its highest level.  The "geek" side of me is also peaked at the Wii's built-in Internet capability.  By Christmas night, my younger son was watching You Tube video's on the big screen via the Wii.  So, we as Internet developers not only now need to consider the various browsers, I guess we need to also convince our employers to code for the game consoles.  Let's see, how can we justify a Wii, XBox, and PS3 as corporate coding platforms?  Now, that is a challenge.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree 100% that compared to 2007 this year was kind of a let down in gaming (because of COD4, Assasin's Creed, and BioShock). Overall it is getting harder and harder for me to find games that even keep my attention long enough to get past the first few levels.</p><p>This year there are only two games that really stand out for me: Dead Space and Mirror's Edge. Dead Space completely redefines Horror Survival Shooters for me (I have not played Left for Dead yet though), and I was engaged the entire time. The 3rd person view is great, with "organic" indicators such as the health meter being the spine of your protective suit. The missions do not seem contrived, and most of all -- the PUZZLES are not contrived. The level where you have to plant the beacon on the meteorite and release it was both frustrating and fun at the same time.</p><p>Mirror's Edge is new and different, and I really liked its "style" and the music is awesome. The better I got at it, the more I enjoyed it. But be warned that if you don't like having to do things over and over again to get them just right, it is probably not the game for you.</p><p>I still have high hopes for a few games released in the past few months that I simply have not had the time to play yet this year: Left 4 Dead, Prince of Persia, Far Cry 2, and Gears of War 2 top my list.</p></div>

I used to play the old Mortal Combats a lot, so just hearing "GET OVER HERE!!!" puts a smile on my face.</p><p>Guitar Hero World Tour is interesting, but the difficulty isn't as tough as Rock Band.  Plus, as a musician, I was irritated by how most game "notes" do not follow the rhythm and harmonies of the actual songs.</p><p>But, THE game for me is Tomb Raider: Underworld.  Another throwback game, and I realize that most folks are done with the TR franchise.  But, they greatly improved on Lara's animation, and they've given her a few new movements.  TFU will collect dust until I'm done with TR.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've only had my PS3 for about a month, but I already have a crapload of games for it - so many that I'm in this schizophrenic state of trying to play about 5 games at once.</p><p>So far, I think the best game I've played is Metal Gear Solid 4.  It has ridiculously long cutscenes (we're talking multiple iterations of two or three &gt;20 min scenes back to back), but they're incredibly well-done and if you can tolerate sitting through them, you're in for some seriously kickass gameplay.  I found myself awake and still playing at 4am more than a couple times.</p><p>Also a big kudos to Little Big Planet.  It's a cute, family-friendly game that is both fun and challenging.  And the fact that you can play with up to 4 people simultaneously is just awesome (though we rarely get anything accomplished as we spend much of our multiplayer time goofing off)</p></div>
