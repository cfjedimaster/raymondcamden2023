		<div class="comment_text"><p>I believe the FuseBox community still uses FuseDocs although I've worked on a lot of FuseBox projects where nobody bothered with them. Actually I'd say most of the Fusebox projects I've worked on didn't have any FuseDocs, but there have been a few.</p><p>When I first started putting together the onTap framework (several years ago), I wanted something similar that could be used to describe projects independent of the particular framework or even the language in use and after looking around a bit and not really finding anything (at the time) I created an XSD for something I called Simple Programming Environment Catalog (SPEC). What was different about SPEC in particular compared to FuseDoc is that it was tech-agnostic, so there were tags and attributes for describing things like files, objects, functions, custom tags, databases and their entities (tables, views, etc) whereas FuseDocs at the time only described the purpose of the current file and its input/output (i.e. no way to describe functions, custom tags, etc).</p><p>SPEC really should have been a separate project and should have been promoted more widely but I never really did that and nobody else took up that torch either, so ultimately as of yet it's only been used to document the functions and custom tags in the onTap framework. In theory however the XSD should provide the ability to create a simple "map" of any given software project end-to-end with information about all the dependencies between objects, etc. So you should be able to use it to fuel for example the creation of UML diagrams. The down side of course is that there's not been adoption in the community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For my current project, I have actually downloaded and am using Canvas Wiki.  I figured this way, I could just bundle the final product and all of the documentation into a single site (it is to be hosted on an intranet).  This way, I also thought that the users could expand on the Wiki with various other notes and concerns, etc. as the program was adopted... Sounded like a good idea in my head, and in execution it hasn't been too bad, just have to keep remembering to go in and document the different areas as I develop them</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Rob on having an "encompasing" documentation site.  To me, an application's documentation is more than just documenting the source code/api's.  A wiki (or portal) site for the application does seem to be a good model to use.  As to what to put into the site, I would think at a minimum the documentation should include: Installation/Upgrade instructions, Changelists, API documentation (if project includes a library of components/services that can be used separately), and a Basic User's guide, if usage is not intuitive enough, which can often be the case.</p><p>Optional documentation, to me, would include: Advance Users Guide, Requirements/Specifications (although this may be a mandatory, if you encounter requirements constantly shifting), Test Results, and Issue/Bug Tracking/Reporting.</p><p>Of course, Gary does have a good point, even if in made in light-hearted mode.  If you are developing the documentation for the organization, then you may want to off-load to a good technical writer in your organization/group.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read the original post and thought he was asking for "my app is done; now I need to write docs for my user".  In that case I use Microsoft word and would distribute docs as PDFs.  Whether that is good or bad is open to discussion.</p><p> However, many of the responses seem to be from the stance of "developer documentation" for the pre-development stage of the project. In that case, I'll use mind maps and often use <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomapping.com%3AHusZg3TMVRiJW8crAy6a8cu82Mc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="comapping.com">comapping.com</a>.  Freemind is a good desktop tool.  I like enterprise architect for class diagrams / UML type of stuff.  And at this stage, writing stuff in a word doc is not uncommon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I usually get me requirements through discussions.  I transfer those discussions to a flow chart.  A buddy of mine turned me on to using excel for this.  I usually have a mock up of any gui, the flowchart of business logic, any db info (i.e. stored procs, tables, fields), and any other dependencies.  Each piece of the puzzle gets it own tab.  I include a db tab that has my schema layout.  In excel you can place links to goto other tabs.  I have a table of contents that allows me to quickly jump to any content I need.</p><p>For my release notes, I have this information in Trac.  For my user documentation, I have a separate Trac site. The users aren't as enthusiastic about using the wiki to help others as I am in supporting the applications.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Pretty sure I have it worst than most. My company has specific documentation standards.</p><p>New systems are fully documented:<br>A document for the database description - a single large database structure diagram - I use Dia - and a description every field, documented for type, column description and PK/FK/Nullability, etc.</p><p>A document for object structure, smaller object relation diagrams, also made with Dia, duplication of field descriptions from the database document. This document is typically 3 pages per aspect of the application.</p><p>Each major area of the system is given a detailed document in the repeating format, per screen, of: general description of area, screenshot with highlighted areas, description of each area including every field visible, processing logic of each exit point. These documents are easily 25+ pages</p><p>Each major area is also given a test case document, instructing a tester in how to test each and every aspect with different environmental options toggled in various ways. These documents are typically 10 pages.</p><p>There are also other documents, but I'll try not to get into them...</p><p>Small changes require me to make a service request document that explains everything we're trying to accomplish - it's about 15 pages long, and the contents vary greatly based on complexity, writer, caffeine amount, etc.</p><p>Any changes to database or screens or functionality in the application requires that we update any legacy documentation, have it re-approved by the users, including test docs re-ran, and then those are all re-published.</p></div>
