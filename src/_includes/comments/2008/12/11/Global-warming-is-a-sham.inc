		<div class="comment_text"><p>Boy Ray, first hurricanes and now snow.  What's next, earthquakes, volcano's erupting, cats and dogs (well you know)?</p><p>Out here in the great Northwest, it is in the 40's to 50's.  So, it is now into the rainy season, but at least we don't get monsoons (e.g., hurricane downpours, that is unless you live on the ocean side of the Olympics, like say Forks).  The snow stays (for the most part) up in the mountains, which are only an hour or two away, and then we can come back to mild climate.  Of course, there is word this week that we may have a chance of temperatures getting down in the 30's here and for snow.  We usually get one or two weeks a winter where there is a storm.</p><p>Ray, maybe, you should break the Inconvenient Truth to Al Gore.  He may want to update his slide show.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, it is a sham. Less than a 1 degree C global rise in 100 years. I can feel my skin blistering with that huge increase! &lt;rant&gt; This sort of change is nothing and to believe an entire planet is supposed to maintain the exact same temperature for 100's of years is ridiculous. It's impossible to maintain exactly 21 degrees C in my little house with a digital thermostat, so how the heck is a whole frigging planet supposed to do the same with 1000's more variables in play! &lt;/rant&gt;</p><p>That's a lovely snowgargoyle, Ray.
