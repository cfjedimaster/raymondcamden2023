		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sure it does work. But you know what I mean, it is not considered a good practice anymore to mix HTML and Javacript code. It is not difficult to achieve, specially with libraries like jQuery.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I don't think it's the point though. If you know jQuery, and feel comfortable using it, you aren't the target for this feature. Know what I mean? For a guy who knows little to no JS, you have to admit this is -very- powerful for such little code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is there any reason why we wouldn't just use the html format cfgrid to do this?  Lots of built in sorting and other functionality is already built in.  Plus it is extremely easy to add listener style "find as you type" searching to that grid.  I know that you were going for simple but I'm just throwing this out there as another simple idea that gets the job done with very little code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jean: It depends on who you ask. A lot of people think that the "unobtrusive Javascript approach" is a crock of horse and does little more than add extra maintenance and scavenger-hunt-like round tripping to an AJAX app.</p><p>It's easy to make the argument that interactivity and mutational and reactive interface programming is fundamentally different than visual skinning and presentationing. That interactivity is immutably tied to the structure and layout of an interface, and that it therefore makes more sense on all levels to an appropriate portion of Javascript live nextdoor to and among the markup it's managing.</p></div>
