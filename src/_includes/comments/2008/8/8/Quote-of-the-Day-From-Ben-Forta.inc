		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just sharing observation, nothing more.  I run CF Standard @ Home on my CentOS server.  I realize my domain doesn't have a lot up on it at the moment, but I went digging through logs and I didn't find a single sql injection.  None of my main pages or a hrefs link to a single *.cfm file and that's because I use Apache's mod_rewrite to pass traffic where I want it to go.</p><p>It's not that difficult to figure out that my server is running CF, but you can keep those pesky *.cfm links out of the google searches and such, you won't be picked on as much.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Lance: If my understanding of bot net attacks is correct (which it certainly might not be), the attacks will continue until the affected computers have removed the malicious script that is sending out the requests.  If this is hundreds or thousands of computers, I suspect it could take a long while for the attacks to cease.  Hopefully someone can weigh in with more information about how the attacks work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi everyone.</p><p>Not glad that other people are having the same trouble.</p><p>One of my clients sites was being hacked yesterday and they were able to piggy back the sql code in a query string on a simple select query. As I'm no expert, it took me a while to figure out how they were updating fields in tables where no update query existed in the site.</p><p>What I landed up doing was adding a filter in the Application file to look through all query strings and check for the words "Declare" or "Exec". If found, route the request to a page where there is no query to execute.</p><p>&lt;!---Catch SQL Injection attacks via url---&gt;<br>&lt;cfif ReFindNoCase("Declare",#cgi.QUERY_STRING#) GT 0 OR ReFindNoCase("EXEC",#cgi.QUERY_STRING#) GT 0 &gt;<br>	&lt;cflocation url="/deny.cfm"&gt;<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;</p><p>I was using queryparam in the query to check for an id field but the query made it through. Here is what the request looked like originaly:</p><p>bookdetails.cfm?id=132';DECLARE%20@S%20CHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x4445434C41524</p></div>
