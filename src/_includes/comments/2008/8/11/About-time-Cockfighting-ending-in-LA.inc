		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Tim - your understanding of the term evolution is incorrect, I'm afraid. Evolution is is the process of change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. The changes from one generation to the next could be minuet, and given that a generation in e.coli is much shorter than a generation for humans, its much easier to observe.<br>The common falsity is that humans "evolved" from primates - we didn't, we had a common ancestor, and at some point in time, our inherited traits went one way, and led to humans. Primates and Humans share 97% of the same DNA, but it is that minuet difference over a very long period of time that  has made a massive difference.<br>There is still evolution within the species - only at some point and time, we became so different that we stopped being the same species.</p><p>Look, I also know that no amount of reason or science will suffice for you. I know that holes in scientific theory will be enough for you not to believe it. And thats cool, really, it is. However, that doesn't make Creationism science. It's faith, and that's great - religious faith has a very prominent place in our society, and I believe it can be the basis for great good in our world today. Let's just keep it out of the science class room, and lets keep science out of the church sermon.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hang on a second - creation wasn't witnessed at all, by anyone on the earth, so, "more or less" is not correct, "less" is.</p><p>Evolution is a theory, but one supported by discovery. An initial comment (not by you) was that evolution "has never been observed in nature or in a lab", and when it was pointed out that it was, now we're looking for non-lab examples. I could point to species of fish that have grown "legs" and the ability to breath out of water, but I doubt that would suffice to your needs, because such observations would be less than iron clad. Its an amazing catch-22 you present, "make an iron-clad argument with all of the conditions I apply to the argument or you are wrong". The fact that there has been evolutionary progress made in a lab is one level of proof of the theory, and it can be applied to complimentary levels of science.</p><p>Controlled lab experiments are required, in order to provide documented conditions, start points, end points, etc (just like software testing!). If we discovered an "evolved" plant, animal, reptile, protozoa, etc, the argument would simply be "that's not evolution, that was there all the time, and you just found it for the first time". I envy you - it's a great situation to be in.</p><p>I'm willing to question science at every turn - the whole nature of science is to question. You stated "if the religion is truth" - and that is where I think we differ. Creationists start with "the truth" and tie everything back to that. There can be NOTHING that differs or defers with the written word - I mean, it just CANNOT happen. I think when you study everything within those confines, you will find a "rational" argument for every natural occurrence. That, however, is not science.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>LOL, you would be good at dodge ball if your as good on your feet as you are with your keyboard. (How about a direct answer rather than changing the subject.)</p><p>Bacteria exchanging genetic material with other bacteria that currently exists in the other bacteria is NOT new genetic information. Let me help, for it to be evolution what is required is new genetic mutations that are favorable to the species that 'add genetic code'. There have been bacteria and others that loose genetic information that is beneficial. Sometimes it takes genetic information to react to poisons and such. In these cases a loss of genetic information can make a species appear to 'evolve'. See how they now can resist the offending element that they could not before. Of course the fact that there is a loss and not a gain in information isn't actually 'evolution'. LOL</p><p>So, once again... realizing you are just repeating the faith chants of those who trained you to think as you accuse others... how about just answering about this.</p><p>(And you showing a fish grew legs... that isn't actually what evolution teaches. Perhaps you should go back and get refined on that. It should be a species that evolved legs. You would need a continued chain of fossils not a unique example matched to another unique example from different parts of the world. That just isn't definition 2 of science. Of course it works for a 'study'.)</p><p>Bottom line is even Dawkins in the newest hit Evolution movie (just having fun) confessed he didn't have any proof for evolution. He even went as far as to say it was even acceptable in his thinking that some alien entity could have triggered evolution here on earth.</p><p>Of course to each of us is the weight of choosing what we believe and why. You are not accountable to me. Your only accountable to God if He (or he depending) exists.</p><p>Funny is how "humans" (those who believe in either view) are to people who think different. Years ago the monkey trial questioned teaching evolution in school. The point of the case was they thought alternate views were healthy. Now people are against the views once taught in school, even with more mature understanding they are not allowed. What a fork tongue people from any camp can show. The bigger question is not what your 'religion' is... but where are you as a human. Let's all play nice and smile, eh? 100 years ago it would be cool to bad mouth evolution rather than to just disagree. Now the new cool is to bad mouth ID or creation thinkers. Bottom line, it's not about science in those regards. It's about chest beating hostility to show someone fits into a camp saying the other view is stupid. How about sharing views without  character slurs, eh? After all, use science or just drop it. There is an offer for science we would accept and you totally avoided it. Increase of genetic (new) information.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I like your question. :)</p><p>Personally my belief is a strong belief in Jesus Christ as God. (So no one will accuse me of hidden agenda.) Now with that said, let me ask a question that I ask other 'believers'. Why or how did we come to the conclusion that the actions and nature of God are not scientific? Where did we get the idea that things God does are not according to the same universal truth of how things work as we also deal with on a day by day basis? (He just may know more about how things work than us... ruling him out isn't even scientific. We don't rule out aliens but we rule out God. LOL... let's not get off on that.)</p><p>My point is we should teach in science class what we can prove as reproduced 'science'... and the rest if we allow it in a 'science class' should be taught as either theories or different interpretation on the residual evidence since conclusive 'science' (number 2 above) is not available. What matters in 'science' is that we know how things work, and how to discover things. There is a set of ethics taught in the unproven realms of evolution that goes beyond science. So I have no problem removing religion from the class... but that would include a majority of evolution using the same standards of what we remove concerning 'God'. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray/John,<br>    I've changed my mind - I think you are 100% correct. We cannot prove many aspects of science, just as we cannot prove creationism and/or ID. We should stop teaching that which we cannot prove....in Public, tax paying schools, that is. Ray, I'm sure your state will have a referendum on this long before mine (CT) will, and I would encourage you to listen to Johns argument and see that the right thing is done. Don't limit it to just evolutionary theory - make sure all "science" that cannot be reproduced in an effective manner be struck from the curriculum. I'm not sure what that will include, but I'm quite sure a certain amount of astrology will fall into that category, for example. Let me know if I can help with any letter writing campaigns, or anything like that.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Vince</p><p>First, no one said science should not be taught in school.</p><p>Second, when you can't prove scientifically something to be so it is a religious belief. For me the eye as we humans enjoy is something beyond the reach of evolution. Yet, the eye being formed can not be proven as created. At the same time there is no science to even approach it's function. It depends on several complex relationships that science has no explanation for how it could have evolved. My point is simple. Now if you will be gracious for me to explain one more thing... it takes genetic information (code) to allow things to 'evolve'. Teaching evolution without showing a genetic chain of information being added because of external appearance or some common traits is a religious belief. Possibility or appearance of truth isn't truth. In our courts we call that circumstantial evidence, but it should be proven before a verdict is passed. (Just like my belief that the eye is created.) At the end of the day, it's not about science but about our belief system beyond the science.</p><p>Third, I am for additional research (scientific) searching for what we can 'prove'. But the concept of the bacteria brought up earlier. Yes, there are single cell organisms that exchange existing genetic information. If multi-cell organisms did this then men would have the ability to form wombs by touching women. :) (Gotta love that one, any guys want to get rich making that happen!) The point is the information already existed within the same kind. It wasn't an amoeba getting information from bacteria.</p><p>So... my request is to put science back in the science room if we are going to kick out religion. For some reason we tend to think as long as we don't say "God" it's not religion. Here is the number one definition from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.com%3Ak8BTTuZFmIThpWVzTzanuV4VFOY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="dictionary.com">dictionary.com</a> for religion ....</p><p>1.	a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.</p><p>You can see it expressly concerns superhuman agencies... but certainly in no way exclusive. It also applies to unproven beliefs of evolution. Religion isn't just about God. People who reject God, including Dawkins in the ID movie has express beliefs about the nature of God. And since in his mind God doesn't express his religious belief structure he rejects his existence as being true. Again, not based on science but the religious dogma of Dawkins.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi John, you said your definition of a religious belief is: "Second, when you can't prove scientifically something to be so it is a religious belief." and that lends so context to your argument. However, the generally accepted definition of a religious belief is one that is centered on a supernatural or divine being. So, when I or someone else uses "religion", that's where we are coming from.</p><p>What Vince is saying is what you are saying - don't teach what you can't prove. We can't prove the existence of a lot of science, so don't teach it. We can't prove the existence of a God, so don't teach religion (as defined by the etymology of the word). You're not saying "don't teach science" just "don't teach what we can't prove and/or observe", right?</p><p>That was your "had be at hello" moment - I'd even go so far as to say that at a public school level, we just teach Math and English (ok, maybe a little Geography, since we know where countries are, for the most part!) and leave all of the rest optional. Heck, the less school you have, the less tax you pay. Why not? That way, if you believe in creationism/evolution, you can enroll your kids in one (or both) of those classes.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@John Farrar</p><p>I appreciate your follow up.</p><p>To me, so many of you ARE saying to remove science because tainting it with creationism is effectively removing science from the picture in my opinion.</p><p>At least in my country (US).  Religion IS INDEED defined with GOD in mind implied, written, or otherwise.  I really don't care how <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.com%3Ak8BTTuZFmIThpWVzTzanuV4VFOY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="dictionary.com">dictionary.com</a> or Websters or wikipedia or my neighbor defines religion.  What I'm saying is that this movement towards requiring the teaching of creationism alongside the traditional science classes is based upon a disingenuous motivation to push one religious belief upon the masses.</p><p>Science is not founded upon the principal that there is a higher being.  At least it's never ever ever been mentioned in my classes and for good reason.  Religion...Creationism is.</p><p>If you choose to interpret this agenda driven belief differently or if you are taking this suggestion and running with it for honest reasons after the fact, that's fine but it's based on religion and was cooked up for the sole fact to counter what the schools are teaching because it goes against what is taught in SOOO many religions.</p><p>I'm OK with allowing an OPTIONAL ELECTIVE for creationism but it MUST, at least in America, be called religion and their must be additional Religious ELECTIVE choices if you allow creationism.  Each Religion teaches a different interpretation of how we got to where are are today.</p><p>We are constantly correcting ourselves with our science because it's not perfect.  I get that.  What I don't get is how the legislation allows the passing of creationism in the classrooms.</p><p>I'm sorry if we disagree.  It is clear that our differences to me at least are irreconcilable.  I would be willing to take the blame for not being more open-minded but then I suppose you could shoulder just as much blame.</p><p>I'm happy to allow you the final word.  I will doubtfully reply but I will certainly read.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Vince,</p><p>So the bottom line, you stated no matter what (or by virtue of a lack of counter point... not at all offended, just stating my understanding)... you don't care what a dictionary says the word religion means. You are using religion by your private (or socially applied) definition to mean anything that includes supernatural beings with systems of worship. That is what you want out of the class room. It doesn't matter to you if individual points of evolution are unfounded and taught as fact... as long as they are not religious in your expression of the term. Do I understand?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John,<br>    I'm not sure, based on Vince's prior email, that he will be responding. I don't believe Vince is using a private meaning for the word "religion" - the generally accepted (or socially applied) meaning of that word is in reference to a supernatural being and a set of beliefs that includes a system of worship. Vince isn't out of order using the word in that context. I think Vince was pretty clear that he wanted that out of the classroom as a *mandatory* part of education. Personally, I think it should be taught outside of school altogether, but thats a personal preference.</p><p>Now you get onto another point - a lot of science isn't based on fact, it's based on theory, and there are holes those theories - and its not just evolution.</p><p>Now, it seems to me, and correct me if I am wrong, that you are arguing for parity. If we can't prove supernatural forces, and thus can't teach it in a classroom, and we can't prove an aspect of science (I'll let others argue whether we can or not) don't teach that either. Right? Would that suffice?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

I have so much work to do but I feel you deserve a response!!! :)</p><p>I really really need to get some work done but I'll continue to follow this thread...However, to (semi) quickly answer your question...</p><p>Religion _I_ believe is interpreted by most everyone that above all, it's a belief in a higher being.  There are some who disagree but most are defining it differently to suite their purpose or point.  Thus being less than honest.  Science is not based on the belief of a higher being.</p><p>I get the fact that we all define things differently.  I'm just bummed that the legislation in LA passed to allow creationism in the classroom.  That doesn't mean they are wrong to do so.  It means that _I_ think they are wrong.  The wrong-proving is subjective of course.</p><p>My experience in the classroom was always that the theory of evolution was taught as such...a theory.  Most all of my teachers would mention that some scientists disagree and some religions disagree.  That is was I expect to continue.  I don't expect to ever have to deal with my kids being subjected to in depth talks about the theory of creationism as if it is science.  It is religion.</p><p>We just fundamentally disagree with the definition of Creationism, Science, and Religion and are splitting hairs trying to define the difference.  Different dictionaries define words differently.  Yes, even words can be a subjective subject when two people are reading them from two different viewpoints.</p><p>By picking just the part about how I define religion, and not responding to my last post, I'm wondering if you too are too busy.  ;)</p><p>Back to work...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Vince,</p><p>a theory no matter how you slice it is not science any more than your definition of religion.  Perhaps I should state it this way, science class is no more a place for philosophy based on unproven 'science' than for points of religion that are not scientific. (Unless your saying there is "NOTHING" scientific about religious beliefs.)</p><p>I do actually respect that if you don't want your children taught my religious beliefs it is IMO wrong for me to use the public school to get around you as their parent. That point we are in agreement on. I would ask you a question now. Does the teaching on creation present it as a 'fact' or a theory/belief of others? Why is it wrong to present one scientifically unvalidated  theory but not another? Why do you believe (if not religion) that it is OK for anyone to teach philosophy in a science class rather than using our tax dollars to teach children in a class what we do know? Why not teach more about essential fatty acids and such? Let me correct that question... do you believe it is OK because the word God isn't attached to push unvalidated history as fact when we know it is 'intolerant' of social groups?</p><p>My thought is in a day to day social function it isn't benefited by believing in evolution. That isn't what makes a man a good employee, neighbor or citizen. In fact disbelieving evolution doesn't make a man a bad accountant, doctor or police officer. I don't require an answer... and don't care to debate the subject till you agree with my long winded discourse. I appreciate the time and answers you have given even though we don't agree. I do believe you to be sincere though it humors me deeply that your view is that nothing of God is scientific, and that anything that would support the concept of God or creation is obviously contrary to good science. That seems somewhat close minded. That is the whole part of the anti-ID/creation side of the fight that is IMO failing in logic. That isn't meant to be slighting. Seriously that is just me being honest about how it sounds hearing the anti-religion intolerant attitudes. Intolerance is no excuse for intolerance. Yes some religious groups are not tolerant. So we solve them by social intolerance doesn't sound like we actually 'practice what we preach'. :)</p></div>

By your own arguments in this thread, it cannot be presented as science.</p><p>"Why is it wrong to present one scientifically unvalidated theory but not another? Why do you believe (if not religion) that it is OK for anyone to teach philosophy in a science class rather than using our tax dollars to teach children in a class what we do know?"</p><p>OK, so you're agreeing with a previous statement I made - we shouldn't be teaching EITHER creationism OR any other subject that is not iron clad in its proof (that would include, but not be limited to evolution and other scientific topics - I think subjective history would also be included). Correct? You agree with this?</p><p>"anything that would support the concept of God or creation is obviously contrary to good science. That seems somewhat close minded." In my case, its not close minded - I've heard the arguments, I've read the literature. I don't believe it. That's not close minded, that means you have to make a better argument.</p><p>No one here is intolerant - I personally am not anti-religion. I really take exception to that John. This has been an above board conversation where some disagreements have been aired. There really is no need to call those that disagree with you intolerant. People such as myself simply believe that creationism should not be taught in a science class. That's not intolerant. I simply believe that specific religious beliefs should be taught in a private setting. THAT is not intolerance.</p><p>David</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Humanism is a religion in my opinion. Science that is a study and not a fact is my problem. It is amazing how our courts cannot tell what OJ was doing the night his wife died but we can come up with a few bones and we know SOOOoooo..... much about the cultures of ancestors and animals. LOL, it's like story time for kids who out grew Dick and Jane. :)</p><p>If you are agreeing that this type of silly teaching has no place then we both agree. The consideration that science cannot prove evolution doesn't prove it didn't happen any more than science proves the earth wasn't 'created'. It just is not the job of the public school system to fill in the blanks for the parents on these areas. They should not fill in the blanks with unproven concepts of evolution or religion. They should stick to what they can prove rather than what the current curriculum board can agree on by majority vote. (I will say we agree if that is what you are saying in regards to a 'science' class.) :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John, I understand *you* may consider humanism a religion (nice tangent by the way, not too bad at dodge ball yourself), but in the general acceptance of the term "religion", or even the strict etymology of the word if you prefer, it is not. There is no supernatural deity being worshiped. You are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts. LOL.</p><p>I'm not sure what you are asking me to agree with - <br>I asked you a question, to get some clarification on your position, here it is again, in case you missed it:</p><p>&gt;OK, so you're agreeing with a previous statement I made - we shouldn't be teaching EITHER creationism OR any other subject that is not iron clad in its proof (that would include, but not be limited to evolution and other scientific topics - I think subjective history would also be included). Correct? You agree with this? &lt;</p><p>I'm not talking about "this type of silly teaching" - I'm talking about *all* subjects that are subjective, not iron-clad, etc. A huge swath of history will go out the window too, believe me. I'm sure many subjects will become optional in that scenario.</p><p>If we live in a country where all education is available, and *I* personally (and you, by natural extension) get to choose the education my child receives, then sign me up! Personally, my child will see no difference in her education. You can go on calling me intolerant, silly, anti-religious, whatever you want, sticks and stones man.</p><p>David</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No... choosing to not expose your child to my religious beliefs is something I agree with. Throwing out private interpretations of history, science and more from our school system (or making them electives the parents can agree to like field trips) would be a great thing IMO. Imagine that a child went to college and studied their vocational subject rather than say "English". We study English in college because they claim we don't do a good job in high school. That is another tangent... but it is yet one more way for me to say, YES! :) One of the best ways to solve the budget crisis of our public schools it to make the public schools focus on education again. (And I will stop there on the public schools, lol.)</p><p>My thought on intolerant is that anyone who allows philosophy that aligns itself with a religious group but not another is intolerant. (And yes, I know that is an over simplification... but don't want to go down that tangent online in text.)</p><p>Now ref. you so called dodge. It was actually not a dodge, it was meant to be inclusive for your topic of what is 'religion'. See:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHumanist_Manifesto%3AfjdFFtV9QFFYNf3wc9NM99ACHRA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Manifesto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a><br>(esp. see the American Humanist view of the term 'religious' in this article on their site. They are not using the term religious the same as you would for someone following a God, but they believe the term and application does apply to the belief system of 'no belief' also. So the point is this, our court systems have over and over for years under the definition of religious beliefs allowed conscientious objectors, and many other things where theistic ties are not the basis of religious freedoms. These are not unique individual interpretations of people like me.)<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanhumanist.org%2Fpress%2FNJ_harassment.php%3Acegebsb3MaS7gPPGXlaxNtCJI7o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.americanhumanist.org/press/NJ_harassment.php">http://www.americanhumanist...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Does No+Yes = Maybe?</p><p>Again, you are using your interpretation of what a religion should be, to supplant what a general understanding of what religion actually is. A religion without a higher being to worship? Don't be ridiculous. OK, Humanists are wrong in their use of the word too - happy? That's like calling Communism a religion - which maybe it does fit your particular definition of that word.</p><p>I don't know about you, but I feel we've reached the limits of this conversation. I think you have presented a text book argument for the Creationist side - present no fact, use misdirection at every turn, hope that the other side gives up first. Its the classic "last man standing" approach - when all other arguments are not met to your specific standard, there can only be one argument left, "mine" and it must be right. You'll be glad to know that you are not alone, fundamentalist religions all over the world use the exact same strategy, time and time again.</p><p>Like Vince, I'll let you have the last word, as I am leaving for a well earned (that NOT open for debate) long weekend early, and probably won't have the interest in picking this up when I return.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>People have there opinion. I raise them and treat them better than alot of animals have it. Some women told me I should be ashamed of teaching them to fight....wo to much credit if I could teach an animal with a pea size brain to fight to much credit definitely to much credit. My grandpa raised them for 62 years. He was a good man. He raised seven chidren who are all good people. Just because some people are raised in a different world than you doesnt mean it needs criticizm but feel free. Cockfighting is never going away and will only get more elusive because it mostly is just getting with your friends and having  a competion and good time something that most of or relatives did a hundred of years ago.</p></div>
