		<div class="comment_text"><p>What sucks is I could really use some Flex training and I live here (well Indianapolis actually but it is only about 45 minutes from my house) but alas I cannot go.  Our first true family vacation in 2 years in scheduled for that day.  Oh well, if you see somebody passing by conference south bound in a gray MiniVan full of kids shouting "Go CF!" it was me!  Have fun at the training sessions everybody!</p></div>

Make sure your MiniVan has its "Got ColdFusion?" bumper sticker in case you run into Ben!</p><p>We hope to catch both you AND Ray at BFusion/BFlex '09!</p><p>Bob<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbflex.info%3AYTotyJXxwCcgaDlSqioJwtMvkuM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://bflex.info">http://bflex.info</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy M</p><p>Oh yeah, we are just about at capacity. We had to raise the limit yesterday. We know that there will be some no-shows. It's a gamble, but you have to give the people what they want!</p><p>Roughly 80% are beginners on both the CF and Flex days. Nothing like turning folks onto a good thing! We certainly have more room for advanced attendees.</p><p>We have great speakers, it's a fantastic facility and a great town with great restaurants.
