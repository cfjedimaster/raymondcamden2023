		<div class="comment_text"><p>who says this is apples fault? I'm sure apple could careless if you do this but im 100% sure AT&amp;T had a complete fit over it, since it alleviates the need to purchase their additional $60 a month mobile wireless plan. This would also explain why the app was approved and then taken down.(apple approved it... att had them remove it)</p><p>You may not like apple for it but hey at least they are pushing this stuff forward (and very quickly i might add), look at m$ or blackberry, etc.. how far have they pushed the technology in recent years... not very much</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>well the silence isnt to wonderful but they might also be waiting for an official response from att's lawyers and then they need to put out a response from their lawyers which might take a few days. AT&amp;T might even have to change their user agreements for this, I can see att not thinking this would happen. This started on fri &amp; its only monday now.. give them time to work it out.</p><p>Everyone wants an answer but I think in this particular case the answer might not be so clear and i am sure they don't want to rush a response right out and be dead wrong about it.</p><p>This is also a completely new platform and I am sure it will take awhile to see what the full capabilities are and what people come up with so that both apple &amp; att can anticipate things much better.</p><p>What you all are forgetting is that using this app completely goes against your att user agreement &amp; they "could" terminate your service for using it. I don't think it breaks any of apples rules though.</p><p>Personally, I want to use it just as bad as the next guy but I would also want to use it legally and that seems to be the issue here.</p><p>Just looking at it realistically.......</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@jake<br>Sure they do things wrong.(sometimes &amp; I admin when they do) It's just not that often. I don't see this as being wrong but people don't look at things with common sense. For example if I make an iphone app for myspace that lets me do something like "spam" people.. Do you think myspace will have your account disabled or have apple pull it from their app store? Absolutely!! But yet the app probably is within the scope of whats allowed in the app store(on apple end). I would imagine that people will make all kinds of apps that end up going down this same route. Since this is the first one I am sure they are looking at it in a "fix it right" mode instead of a "patch it now" mode.</p><p>It is just funny how when little things happen how freaked people get, I guess because they are used to most everything apple working right.. that they go off the handle. Just like this exact case. If this was.. say m$ no one would even notice or care because its just that common with them.</p><p>*************************************************<br>ok now look, from nullriver:<br>NETSHARE STATUS REPORT 2</p><p>We've finally gotten in contact with Apple. Looks like the lack of communication was due to automated e-mail systems being employed on both ends, which resulted in e-mails being lost in transit. We're working with Apple to get NetShare back up on the AppStore.</p><p>WOW look at that!! 1 frickin business day and they are getting it fixed!!</p><p>Now if this was m$ you would be waiting 6-12 months but then again m$ wouldnt be in this spot because they couldnt actually come up with something this innovative on their own.</p><p>cant wait for the "Zune App Store"!!! boy will that be a doozy!</p><p>Anyways.. when this does come back I wonder att will do to prevent its use or will they give in and be the good guy?</p></div>

It was just released and who would have predicted the shear volume of apps that have been delivered, you gotta admin that it is pretty spectacular! But with that being said can you imagine the amount of issues that they are trying to get through with people right now? I don't think a couple of days is outta line (especially weekend days) to get something fixed.</p><p>Something else apple screwed the pooch on was not having a beta period for these apps, so I am sure there are a lot of apps working basically in their beta stage right now.</p><p>I want this as bad as everyone else!! I guess I just choose to look at it differently.</p><p>"their previously approved product has been removed, reinstated, and back again"<br>As far as we know this may only just be a db or xml "glitch" and none of us are right about whats going on.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, have you ever checked out the 2nd generation Zunes? They're effing TIGHT man. The software is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, I can't even look iTunes in the face anymore. Everything from design to features, they own the iPods (iPhone included, is it just me or does the interface design of the iPhone software look like a 7th grader did it? Those icons are silly) in pretty much every single way.</p><p>After I got my Zune I couldn't use my iPhone as an mp3 device anymore. Not to mention that Zune lets you download unlimited music (on up to 3 computers and 2 separate Zunes, you can share one plan with your lady) for only $15 a month. On the first day I downloaded about 75 artists' entire discographies in an hour or two. That's about $3000 worth of music. Son. It's rid. Ick. U. Lous.</p><p>As far as the "Zune app store" comment, has anyone seen the demos? They're actually turning the Zune into an entire gaming platform. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zunescene.com%2Fzunegames%2F%3AqWI4rPkbmgFbnnO2VnuPAiZQv4Y&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.zunescene.com/zunegames/">http://www.zunescene.com/zu...</a></p><p>I love how elitist Apple and iPod fans are about the Zunes.</p><p>Sure, Zune is a pretty gay name, but it's definitely less gay than the name iPod. Every single iPod owner (over 10 now) I've demoed my Zune to has immediately been what I'd called shocked that the Zune beats the iPod in so many areas.</p><p>Here are a few.<br>Battery life.<br>Ease of use.<br>MP3 downloading/purchase value.<br>Hot ess software.<br>Hardware design.<br>Interface aesthetics.<br>Features (built in wifi, instead of telling my friend about the new band I discovered I press a button and send her the mp3s wirelessly like should be expected for a 2008 device, built in FM tuner, better podcast management, etc)</p><p>The singular arena that the iPod wins in is variety of accessories. Sweet. Accessories.</p><p>The end.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's pretty obvious that when you pay a monthly subscription fee for something you don't own it. The content you watch on "on demand" cable television, or consume through your broadband Internet service isn't your property.</p><p>Even if the Zune service were discontinued in the future, it would be well worth having used it over trying to build a digital mp3 (or Todd forbid CD collection).</p><p>Instead of biting the bullet and purchasing an album, not knowing if you'll like it or not, or even if you do like it, how many times you'll want to listen to it again and whether it will warrant the initial purchase price, you're risklessly, guiltlessly free to listen to anything you want, when you want. It's the perfect media model, and in a perfect world it would be the exact same way for all media. Luckily, some companies (Microsoft, ATT, etc.) are offering it now, before I have to be elected president and pass laws requiring it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@david<br>"better" is a subjective term, "if" zune was so fantastically wonderful then it would in fact be selling like hot cakes. It seems like only a small % of people go on tech specs and whether its makes it better or not. Look at the iphone.. sure other handsets have better specs but they arent selling like an iphone.</p><p>So how are the Zunes doing now? I see they recently sold their 2 millionth unit!!! WHOO HOO 2 million in 2 years, oh in that case that's not so good, actually that is pretty bad, actually that is almost "throw in the towel" bad. Of the major players in the game they are still dead last.. they can't even over take sandisk.</p><p>Now all this was BEFORE the apple app store...<br>Now suddenly you have an explosion of possibilities at your finger tips NOW, not in 4-5 years it will take the zune to get where the ipod is now. Now you have all these hundreds of millions of older generation ipods out there and they are are drooling over all the new goodies available now on the new ipods. So now you have all these people wanting the new models for the app store and now they will be buying new ones and sending ipod sales through the roof again. And then you got all these people who bought a zune going "where are all my cool new apps?" &amp; then most of them will probably end up buying a new ipod. Things are looking bleak for the zune.. i hate to tell you.</p><p>Now zune may very well be heading towards a gaming platform and honestly it's the only thing I can see that has a chance in hell of saving the zune. As far as the subscription service goes.. obviously it's not that big of an issue &amp; you can already get that from several other companies for any player.</p><p>The problem with m$ is that they think they own the world and that they are cutting edge.. and they aren't. And their marketing tends to go towards an older crowd which is their mistake and they don't innovate anything to a crowd who craves it and then they are several years behind on getting caught up.</p><p>If the zune is for you and you enjoy it then great!! Really thats all that matters.</p><p>As for the portable handset market: ipods (or iphones) + app store = a massive smackdown to the rest of the market.</p><p>M$ is the only competitor out there with the resources or available user base to even challenge what apple has done. But they will wait until it is to late just like always. If i was a betting man I would say that Google will get to it before m$ does.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the iPhone is an impressive piece of desgin and technology, but it's perhaps the most DRMed product out there.  And this situation is yet another vivid demonstration of how DRM harms the legitimate customer.</p><p>It's ironic to watch the huge outpouring of worship for the iPhone from the techie community - many of the same folks who no doubt hate DRM.  It just goes to show that a really cool product and an effective reality distortion field trumps a concern for what's right.  (Microsoft gets crucified, but Apple gets a pass, and the big difference is how the spin is received by the public.)</p><p>Heck, I'm gonna buy an iPhone, and support it as a platform, but I wish there was a truly comparable product that wasn't controlled by Steve's Empire.</p></div>
