		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi all,</p><p>Could you also make a loop method?  So if you ever need to use a method on a list then you just send the list and the method you want to use to the loop method and it just loops for you, then you still have your original method and the loop method can be used for lots of different functions.</p><p>Just a thought.</p><p>Mat</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>About your first part of the question - you can use the methods repeatedly. As long as the methods don't affect the internal state of the object.</p><p>If the objects represent a physical object - calling the same cfc (by reference) could be problematic.</p><p>- Joel</p></div>
