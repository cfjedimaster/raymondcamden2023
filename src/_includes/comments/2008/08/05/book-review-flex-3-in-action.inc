		<div class="comment_text"><p>Who said I had no idea about WSDL and Web Services? What I said was that the details about WSDL were not necessary. Both Flex and ColdFusion allow you to work easily with web services w/o knowing the details of WSDL, so in my mind, it makes sense to skip that in the book. If for whatever reason you do need to know WSDL, then you can pick that up elsewhere. In all my years of web development, I've had to look at a WSDL doc _once_ in order to get something done.</p></div>
