		<div class="comment_text"><p>That _is_ awesome.  As someone who spent 9 years in college myself I know what its like to be one of the older students in class.  It can be intimidating but she (and you) should be proud!  Sociology was one of my favorite classes!</p><p>Also awesome on the Families Helping Families thing!  Wow where does she find the time?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Many congrats to your wife Ray. To be honest, any woman married to guys like us should be put on a pedestal. The fact that they deal with our late night coding sessions, long weekends, writing, etc is testament to their commitment.</p></div>

So much so I have decised to do the same.  You might be sutrprised to see all the 40-somethings in classes these days, so there is still hope for you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just to add a quick note to this.</p><p>A few days ago I went with my wife and eldest rugrat to pick up her school ID and a last book. (She actually ordered most of her books online - talk about unfair - I remember waiting for HOURS to check out.) I can't describe the amount of memories that came back to me being on campus, especially of the book store (long waits and all).</p><p>Oh - and to add to the cool factor - I noticed that one of the texts for ENGL 102 was...</p><p>Watchmen</p><p>How freaking cool is that?</p></div>
