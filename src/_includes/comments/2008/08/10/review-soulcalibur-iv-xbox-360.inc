		<div class="comment_text"><p>Soul Calibur is in my opinion the greatest fighting game series.  I have played every incarnation except SC3.  The manual is to light for all the new things they added.  The character creation is somewhat self explanatory but there are some things that just require too much trial and error before you understand them.</p><p>As far as levels, keep playing.  There is a lot of content to unlock: more levels, hundreds (at least) of pieces of equipment, and many playable characters.</p><p>Yoda is cool but The Apprentice is awesome.  He is a bit unfair, and the AI plays him really well.</p><p>The thing I love about SC the most is that you can move on from button mashing to learning how to use characters very quickly.  Every move is intuitive, and near every d-pad/button combination is a different move.</p><p>Fav characters:<br>Kilik - the most flushed out move list and easiest character to play.<br>Maxi - More advanced to master, lots of chaining combos.<br>Shura - Cervantes with boobs, w00t.</p><p>Tower of lost souls is where all the skill and character creation comes into play.  It gets really hard and some times the equiptment is really hard to get.</p><p>Here is a useful guide to unlock characters and get tower treasures.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogamesblogger.com%2F2008%2F07%2F29%2Fhow-to-unlock-all-10-soul-calibur-4-secret-characters-guide.htm%3AL77izrPiCJcQUqulVg4ocTjxboo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2008/07/29/how-to-unlock-all-10-soul-calibur-4-secret-characters-guide.htm">http://www.videogamesblogge...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To beat the apprentice I just kept using the grab. I was able to do this repeatedly and he seemed somewhat unable to stop it (I don't remember who I was playing though I recall it was not Yoda). Once you have him, he is a great character to play.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been playing SC since it was available on Dreamcast and it was a pretty inventive game even back then.</p><p>On a separate note, if you're into fighting games be sure to check out the new Mortal Kombat when it comes out.  It's MK vs. DC Comics and features Superman, Joker, Batman and the Flash among others.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't played in a while, but I did thoroughly enjoy COD4. I believe I reviewed it a few months back. It is a contender for game of the year - with Bioshock just _barely_ above it.</p><p>My gamer tag is cfjedimaster, but I have to say, I don't do online much with the XBox. I either play WoW online, or I'll do an XBox game, but typically just solo. (Playing Overlord now.)</p></div>
