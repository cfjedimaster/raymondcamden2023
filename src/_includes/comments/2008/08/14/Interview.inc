		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting interview Ray.  While I was listening to it I stopped to ponder as to whether or not you ever got the wish list stuff that I ordered for you (it was a long time ago - a book and a classic nintendo controller).  Anyway, you've been more than a helpful resource to me personally (and indirectly my clients) for a long time so wear the new tattoo with pride.  Once upon a time my wife and I drank a bit too much in Cozumel, Mexico and we got discretely tatted as well.  Not anything cool for me, just a stupid blue wave that reads aquarius underneath it.  Keep up the great work at Broadchoice and thanks for your continued contributions to the CF community!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did actually. Most of the electronics stuff does NOT come with a sender so I can't always send a thank you. I _did_ appreciate it and I hope you will accept my -very- late thank you. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome - glad you got it.  If I was rich I would've bought you the plasma tv LOL.  In other news, I registered <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FCFPadawan.com%3Ag0VITcelBpPSqsUJL5C_EZE9OX0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="CFPadawan.com">CFPadawan.com</a>.  I haven't really done anything with it yet but I have very big plans for it.</p><p>Take care,<br>Andy</p></div>
