		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>I can increase the bar size no problem using this style, but I notice that the bars "spread outward" (even to point of out of bounds of frame) depending on the &gt; 50 value I use, instead of just becoming wider in place and remaining within the frame. Is there another attribute that can decrease the space between bars, pulling them in towards the center?</p><p>Thanks, docs yielded no apparent solution...<br>Mark</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was trying to do a three-series bar chart with an additional two series as line, *and* have the bars different colors, *and* the bars be wider than a toothpick, *and* the legend display the five series with their colors properly.<br>I just couldn't get them all to come together at once. As a workaround, I did the three bars within one series with different item names, then used your handy blog about using the limits in the yAxis section to paint the "lines" behind the bars, and finally had to manually create the legend to show all five with their corresponding colors. Seems like a lot of work...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know that this is an old post but it was quite handy.  A question though...I don't quite follow how shapeSize works.  It almost seems to be a percentage.  If I use 50 (as per your example) it seems to scale the width based on the number of bars.  10 bars at 50 would require me to have 3 bars at 20 for them to be similar in size.  I tried to use something fixed, such as 50px, but that throws an error.  Do you know if there is a way to make them a specific size no matter how many bars there are?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry - not offhand. Best I can suggest is doing what I did - playing with the chart editor.</p><p>As an aside, I really, really, *really* recommend folks don't use this charting engine anymore. It is truly way too old now. Yes, it works, but, there are much better/newer options out there.</p></div>
