		<div class="comment_text"><p>I totally agree with you ray.I loved clone wars, i had no expectations when i went into seeing the movie. when i sat down there were only 5 people watching it with me, and all 5 of them looked above the age of 40. Anyways The movie started and the action was amazing. Great animation, good script and a great way to begin the series!.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - I also enjoyed the movie, as did my kids.  One thing I think a lot of Star Wars 'fans' neglect to acknowledge is that Star Wars has always been geared more towards kids.</p><p>I had a friend tell me that he hated Episodes 1 &amp; 2 because "they were made for a 12 year old".  I told him, "The original was made for a 12 year old, too.  The only difference is, we are not 12 anymore."</p><p>Besids, even if Lucas is 'raping the francise', its his franchise.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoyed it too. I enjoyed it too. One thing that bugged me was Anakin having a padowan in the first place. Was he ever officially a jedi? Yoda was always suspicious of Anakin and I can't see him assigning him an apprentice.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know, I have to disagree. I thought the animation was cool and well done, but the story was completely lame. The "acting" was horrible.</p><p>What drives me nuts most is the lack of skill in storytelling. Combat robots that are ultra-stupid. One looks over an edge and falls over to it's destruction? Ugh...</p><p>I will admit that my friends 8 year old I went with liked it. But then, I LOVED the first Star Wars movies when I was young and they had a somewhat more sophisticated story. Uh, compared to this movie it is like Barney vs Hamlet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First off, my son absolutely loved it.  I was a little dissappointed by the episodal nature of the whole story. One thing I love about Star Wars is its epic nature. This was much more of a day in the life of the Clone Wars.  Interesting -but not a major motion picture.</p><p>The animation style, as well, seemed much less epic (compared to Akira or other Japanese big scale manga films).</p><p>Though, one of the kids I was with (my son's friend) found the animation and music scarier than the live action films. I guess the style really is geared to kids.</p></div>
