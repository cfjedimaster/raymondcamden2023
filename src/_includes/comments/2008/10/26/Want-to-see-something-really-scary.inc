		<div class="comment_text"><p>Right, well we've got the following films lined up for Friday:</p><p>Poltergeist,<br>1408<br>Young Frankenstein.</p><p>Ok the last one is a comedy but one of the greats I'm told. Got them all in HD so it's going to be great to see them in the best quality possible. I haven't seen 1408 either, which doesn't get the greatest reviews but from the trailer it has the psychological scare factor.. The trailer got my GF screaming so that's always a good thing.. lol.</p><p>Your post got me thinking though of other films that are scary but not mega-gory - which I personally hate. Never been a fan of horror but did enjoy the 1979 remake of 'The Body Snatchers'.. That last shot is *very* chilling.</p><p>The ring (US remake) was another one which hit the scare factor but without huge amounts of gore.. Not sure I'd want to watch again but it certainly was an experience watching it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Aha, yeah I saw that Poltergeist had been re-rated in the US to a PG. It's still a 15 in the UK and I must admit I'm quite surprised it's been lowered in rating. If I recall it's got some pretty intense scenes.. Then again it's Spielberg so it can't be that bad. I remember being pleasantly surprised when I first saw it as I was really anti any kind of horror film back then.. Looking forward to revisiting it in HD.</p><p>I was considering The Shining for Friday as well but I'm not sure.. It looks like an incredible disturbing film. I'm trying to keep it scary but not too scary if you know what I mean.. :) Ending on Young Frankenstein should do the trick though..lol</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Event Horizon was pretty creepy... I'm not sure if I would put it in that suspense category tho... I remember it being pretty gory/nasty as well... I was going to give an example but I guess I won't include any spoilers.</p><p>The Ring may also qualify, since there's not much actual gore in it. There's obviously some... but honestly, I thought the Ring was retarded from start to finish. Of course YMMV since I felt the same way about Blair Witch.</p><p>The Shining imo was a decent concept, but unfortunately for me ended up being really slow and dull because they were trying to portray "cabin fever" (prior to when the visions start). Same sort of deal as Silent Running (although it's not a horror flick). But there are some other King titles you might like. I'm sure you've probably already seen Cujo and Christine a long time ago. If you haven't seen the made-for-TV movie Rose Red, that was pretty good and not terribly gory (obviously). Although it is a bit longer - I think it's like 3 hours.</p></div>

I thought the Stand had its moments, but particularly toward the end the execution seemed to fall apart. And the antichrist portrayal throughout the film felt flat and unconvincing to me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Bliss</p><p>Event Horizon was one of those movies that kept you wondering the whole time what actually happened to the victims. There was more gore than I'd like to have seen in it but the fact that you just quite couldn't figure out how "bad" it actually got was what kept it going for me...</p><p>I remember it being on a channel like tmc or something one sunday afternoon recently and when the scene came across with the two women viewing footage of the last recording, I paused it and ran it in slow slow slow mo (thanks dvr) just to get a frame-by-frame of the actual gore. Pretty boring stuff actually. Couple of guys holding their abdomens, one pulling something out of his mouth (I presume his tongue?), another woman scratching her eyes out (but not really, she's just bloody and holding her face), another woman with something coming out of her gut (kinda like scene in alien?). all of them were naked but there was no "nudity" if you know what I mean.</p><p>Anyway, point being, when I did this the thrill was over. Much like Ray mentioned earlier about it killing it.</p><p>But still a great movie. Ironically, the movie "The Sphere" <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0120184%2F%3AXePq3s4HjH-XeNoNoeUWDnkMzr8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120184/">http://www.imdb.com/title/t...</a> which came out relatively close to "Event Horizon" promised the same type of movie but achieved nothing near it.</p><p>CA</p></div>

Something about that creepy girl just stuck with me.<br>2. Halloween - more of my wife's favorite, but I watch it with her every year.<br>3. The Exorcist - I grew up capital-C Catholic, so anything having to do with the devil ALWAYS freaks me out. Check out the re-release with the new scenes. Though, I wouldn't watch it with the kids.</p><p>Good lucky &amp; Happy Halloween!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've always been a huge fan of the old-school scary movies...  I have a hard time trying to think of anything that has given me the chills as much as when Norman Bates' mother turned around in the basement during the end of Psycho.  I saw someone else mention The Birds - another great masterpiece by Hitchcock.  Makes you think twice about going outside :-)</p><p>And of course, I would be remiss to leave out the original Night of the Living Dead.  Frankly, I swoon for zombies.</p><p>I think the whole Hannibal series (The Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) were all pretty strong suspense movies with limited amounts of gore.  Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Hannibal to a T.</p><p>Another really good suspense movie is Phone Booth.  It's really only good the first time you see it, but I found it amazing that they were able to keep me interested through the whole movie when all but a few minutes literally takes place inside a phone booth.</p><p>And last but not least, this doesn't exactly fall into the "low gore" category, but the first Saw movie blew me away.  (all the others were crap though)  There is absolutely no way that you can expect the ending when you see it for the first time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chris,</p><p> I loved the ring too.  I kept me on the edge of my seat.  Also I'd recommend all four original RingU movies.  They have a slightly different feel than the US version.</p><p>Josh,</p><p> I happen to think the whole Saw series is pretty good.  Very intricate plot; with lots of plot interlaced between episodes.  Although, I wouldn't put any of them on a "no-gore" list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@CV - I haven't seem Salem's Lot, but what you describe sounds creepy. I seem a theme here - I was freaked out by the alien "peeping" in Communion, I was freaked out by the alien on the roof in Signs. I guess being watched is a scary thing by itself. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh I knew it was SK. It is one of the few books of his I have missed. The other one I can think of is Cujo. I didn't read Talisman till late too - and dang that was a creepy book. Speaking of creep - for those who read Talisman - the scene where the train is moving, slowly, and there is a creature watching them - that freaked me out too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recommend the Haunting, both the novel (by Shirley Jackson) and the movie (the 1963 version with Julie Harris, not the 1999 remake, which kinda sucked). The movie is black and white, has no gore and no  actual ghosts or monsters, and its still one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was honestly never bothered by the premise of the Village... even enjoyed the ending... although personally I did enjoy Unbreakable more.</p><p>Signs not so much. Signs had some cool dialogue, but the more I've seen it, the more seams it has. Now when I see signs it feels very "budget". Although I will say I don't think that's entirely Shyamalan's fault... I'm still trying to figure out how Hollywood came up with this idea that once any given culture develops interstellar travel, they automatically stop wearing clothing. Like... hey, we can travel to other stars! And we don't need pockets anymore! Woohoo! Nudist time! Seems like a non sequitur. :P</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A twist can either add to - or invalidate a good story. For example, if a dramatic movie ends with everything being a dream, then that means the entire story was nothing. That to me ruins a story. Now if you consider the twist in the 6th Sense - which I won't detail in case folks have seen it - that to me really adds to the story. Ditto for Unbelievable. The twist for The Village was just silly.</p></div>
