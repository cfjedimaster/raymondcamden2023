		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just finally bought myself an Xbox on Friday.  The Force Unleashed was one of the free games I could have got with it, but I opted for GTA4 instead, as I'd read a couple of mixed reviews.  It does look good though, and nothing can beat playing in the Star Wars universe (something I've not done since the days of X-Wing and TIE Fighter); I'll maybe pick it up later.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I found GTA4 to be... interesting, but not enough to hold my attention for long. I also found the control scheme to be a bit too complex. What's funny is that the GTA clone, Saints Row, was much easier and I played it until I finished.</p><p>As for XWing/TIE... I've given up hope for a new version of that. I spent many hours on all those games. The recent 'star fighter' clones all set in the prequels did nothing for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As long as we're straying ... GTA 4 did address some issues that were pretty bad in San Andreas, but IMHO there were still enough things about it that I flat-out didn't like that I couldn't get the level of immersion I wanted. I figure by GTA 6 they will finally have a decent targeting system in place (meaning that by then I'll no longer get killed by a guy standing next to me while I'm patiently shooting at a guy 150 feet away and slightly to my left). I also preferred Saints Row and am looking forward to that sequel, although I admit I am beginning to feel a little uneasy about the characters in those games. I'd rather have Crackdown 2 sometimes. (Yes, I played mostly "good" characters in Oblivion ...)</p><p>I will probably add SW:TFU to my GameFly queue, but it'll be a while before I get to it. Can't put down Rock Band 2 right now. Ray, you're going to review that one eventually, right? :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think what sold me on Saints Row is that it was like GTA lite. The simplicity kept me involved and made the game easier to complete. Now the _story_ itself is better in GTA. It's great. But the game itself is just not sucking me in like Saints Row did.</p><p>I'll definitely ditto the Crackdown 2 wish. I can't believe this game didn't get as much press (outside of the fact that it was tied to Halo 3). I found Crackdown to be much more fun than Halo 3 was. Oblivion.... -sigh-. Beautiful game. Incredible depth. But I couldn't finish it. I keep saying I will, but I don't have another 40 hours to sink into it.</p><p>As for Rock Band 2 - I'm waiting for some kind soul to wish list it. ;) (Yes, I'm greedy. I won't deny it.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Playing the game on normal difficulty is fun.  The real fun is playing this on Sith Master!  You really have to think and react quickly (like a Jedi does in the movies) to survive.  I don't know if I would say that this game requires advanced tactics but I definitely agree with @Ray that you can't just walk around using force grip/throw combo all the time - especially on nasty difficulty.  <br>@Ray you left out one of the more interesting aspects of the game which is the saber fighting styles and combos that you can unlock.  You're awarded style points based on your variety of force and saber moves and their varying degrees of difficulty.  If you master 8 or 10 different combos and mix it up you'll rank up a lot faster.  Also don't forget to try for the "Worst Day Shift Manager Ever" achievement when you're playing the prologue!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy - Yea, good point. I didn't mention it as I can't remember all those combos. I mainly button mash. ;)</p><p>Another aspect which is kinda cool is that you can find saber powerups. Some improve the saber - some just change the color.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good review Ray, I have to say that I enjoyed the KOTOR series because of the epic scale of the story, and that it kept you in that universe without repeating the story of Vader, Luke and the crew. I enjoyed TFU a lot, and I thought the force powers and how they implemented them were amazing. The physics engine and enemy AI were freaking amazing as well. My brother an I spent hours finding new ways to "dispose" of enemies. I agree with you on the button mashing finishers. When you're a spectator its cool to see, but as a player you have to concentrate on the combos, and that's not very exciting. I had the same problems as you with the strange bugs that kept popping up (walking through walls into oblivion, getting killed by invisible enemies, etc.). Overall though I agree with you that it is an awesome game!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was playing SWTFU on Sith difficulty and during my encounter with General Kota my system red ringed right in the middle of the fight - I mean like game, set and match never to be turned on again.  This will be my third XBOX360 and although @Ray joked about the Atari 2600 never blowing up there is some real truth to it (that was my first of many gaming systems).  They seriously must do something about product stability (extra fans maybe?) in the next console or they're going to develop a "permanent" reputation as makers of crappy hardware.  At least this time I bought the no hassle warranty because it looks like I'll need it.  I was watching LOST dvds (yes I've never seen LOST before last month but I'm on Season 2 now and it is a great show) with my wife for approximately 4 hours and then gamed for about 2 when this happened.  If the XBOX360 can't be used in a 68 degree environment for 6 hours without exploding then it is crap.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@AS: Yeah, the 360's only disappointment is the hardware failures. I don't have a PS3, and only know one person who does, but does anyone know offhand if the PS3 suffers the same? I don't mean just hardware failures, but lockups as well?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been beating my 360 controller to the drum beat of The force unleashed this past weekend.  It's definitely the best Star Wars game ever. I'm about 3 missions from completing this game. Good review, officially connecting the two trilogies has brought me back into Star Wars geekdom.   Can’t wait for the follow up. One thing GL can do with the upcoming live action series is to do what the new Batman has done for its franchise.  I want a dark &amp; angry universe to rear its head. No more kiddy BS. It’s the true fans that grew up with the classics they need to satisfy now.</p></div>
