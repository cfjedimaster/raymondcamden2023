		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey! If you have it laying around, could you post the code that you're substituting for the login procedure? I have spent a couple of hours this week looking for some code that combines login functionality with a site registration part. I was hoping for a "Remember me" function as well. I might have to use Ben's <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3l8zy6%3AVlPgqYfpvuDIvquvt_HG0Ooyk18&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tinyurl.com/3l8zy6">http://tinyurl.com/3l8zy6</a> as the foundation -- if I can't get down the road further. Any suggestions? Thanks, and you know don't ya...you da man!</p><p>Can you relate to any of this? :) <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F4znc6q%3AxVAZTXr3W04eMMrCcAVypM_uRKI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tinyurl.com/4znc6q">http://tinyurl.com/4znc6q</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That was a great list Robert. I identified with _all_ of them.</p><p>Sounding's security system is incredibly simple. I don't know if it would be a great system to learn from, but if you want something simple, you can take a look at it. You asked me to post it, but you can download all of Soundings from RIAForge.</p></div>
