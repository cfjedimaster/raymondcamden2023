		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are reasons people don't use soundings. (IMO) It is a great app and that is not one of the reasons. Most people want to put an application up and create a look and feel for the site. Later they want to add more applications to the site and have it share the user authentication system and look and feel without updating the application or installation code. That is a big need for the CF world IMO.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting. Sounding's front end has a very minimal UI, meant specifically to make it easy to skin. As for authentication - in general that's only used for the admin, but yes, it would be nice if it could easily tie in to some other auth. At the end of the day though you will never have "drop in and just work" authentication. You would always have to edit something to let some app tie to some unknown authentication model.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well if we look at other community frameworks like Drupal, WordPress or PHPNuke we can see they allow applications of sort to just be dropped in. That is the concept that has made these solutions so pervasive. The fact is that is what many people are looking for. Of course not everyone and there may be seasons where that approach isn't desired. It can be done though and we are working on doing that at SOSensible for some of our open source work. It would be good to see it done in other frameworks and solutions also. :)</p></div>
