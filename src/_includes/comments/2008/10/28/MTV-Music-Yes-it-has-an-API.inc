		<div class="comment_text"><p>yeah out of like 20 non-mainstream searches, Hum was the only band that came up that I wanted to watch. Pretty bad for the once main outlet of video based music.</p><p>I noticed the full screen never worked for me either. It kept the audio in sync, but just took a snapshot of the last part of the video when I hit full screen and just put up a stationary (pixelated) image. weird.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dana - Trust me, I do remember when MTV played music. I've mentioned it numerous times before on the blog, so I didn't want to go down that track again. ;) I discovered many bands on 120 Minutes.</p></div>

What I want to know is why, now that y'all are old guys you admit to listening non-mainsteam bands from the 80's? - you woulda switched the channel so fast in high school/college had one of your buddies walked in the room [biggrin] that you woulda broke the remote.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@MikeG - I'm a bit confused. Are you saying we would not have admitted to liking indie bands in high school? I know I did - although I was only a little bit into indie then. It was more late high school/early college where I got a proper 'education' into good music.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - yep, indie music is like scotch - an aquired taste.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I wasn't overly impressed with their post about this.</p><p>The API could have been a fantastic service, but restricting it to the extent of forcing users to view videos on their site and not allowed embedded videos is just sad and ridiculous. For all of those people who have spent time developing and API interface, be it web-based or a desktop application, it's been a waste of time.<br>MTV should know better. You can understand the licensing laws for videos, but it's still a damn shame.</p></div>
