		<div class="comment_text"><p>Francois - to be honest, I was a bit disappointed with my session. I'm happy to be picked - honored to be picked! But I really wish I had been asked to speak on something new. This will be the same CF+Ajax preso I've given before (although I'm going to try to make it a bit more fresh). So yes, I honestly would suggest folks check out Jason's. (And bring me notes back so I can blog it! ;)</p><p>Anyone who wants to see my preso and goes to Jason's instead can gladly ping me after MAX and I'll use my Connect account to do a small session for folks. (It's time for the CFJUG to return anyway.)</p></div>
