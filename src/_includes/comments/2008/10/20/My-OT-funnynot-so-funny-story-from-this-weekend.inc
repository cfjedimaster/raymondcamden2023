		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to see I'm not the only one who can 'fail' an eye exam.</p><p>Here's a quick story for you.  So one time I'm sitting in the chair doing the whole 'which one is better, this one, or this one' thing and they both just look horrendous to me.  Terribly blurry.  So I'm starting to get a bit nervous, and I stammer a bit while he keeps switching back and forth before I finally tell him that they both just look terrible.  He pulls the lens out and discovers that the lens was completely filthy.  I was starting to think I was legally blind!</p><p>I'm sure that's an old optomotrist practical joke.  They probably share stories over beers at Eye Conferences of the terrified look on peoples face as they struggle to figure out which lens was better.</p><p>Oh and I'm convinced that pupil dialation is their cruel way of getting back at all the popular kids who called them nerds in high school.</p><p>Finally...I vote -1 on the frames.  Not sure they'd look right on you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, sounds like a second opinion is in order! You shouldn't be given a stronger prescription because an eye is "slipping a bit and he wanted to be sure my eyes didn't get any worse".</p><p>It doesn't work that way (I've worn glasses 20+ years). If you get a stronger lens, it will hurt your eye, not help it.</p><p>Just an amateur opinion/observation!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've worn glasses/contacts for 30+ years and I would have to agree with Davo. Your glasses should help you see properly: they're not going to make your eyes "better". On my last visit to the eye doctor, we decided to change my prescription a little bit, but that was to compensate for presbyopia. (Yep, I'm now one of those people that looks down over the top of his glasses to see something at very close range ...)</p><p>Without glasses or contacts, the eye test is easy for me. Everything looks like blur. (I'm not legally blind - yet - I just have bad astigmatism and moderate myopia.) It's fun for parlor games and such. In the old days, before featherweight lenses, I usually won the lens-thickness contest.</p><p>I've never really found a decent solution for outdoors with glasses. Auto-tint lenses aren't bad going outside but give you a double whammy on bright winter days if it gets that cold (perhaps not where you live) - dark, steamed-up lenses = no fun. Clip-ons are very portable, but you have to carry the case around with you or risk losing them (and I have, twice). I currently have prescription sunglasses, but then you have the case and they're not so easy to switch. At least these are polarized too, so I can wear them indoors and still see somewhat well.</p><p>But they're still no match for cool sunglasses.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am the only person in my family, excepting my sister's week-old babies, who does not wear glasses or contacts.  I don't know how it worked out that way, especially as I've been working on computers since I was 5.</p><p>I've had exactly one eye exam in my life, not including the ones that they make you take in elementary school.  It was about 10 years ago, and it was because I wanted to get a pair of zombie white-out Wild Eyes contacts for Halloween.</p><p>It went about as well as everyone else's seems to -- the stupid and ambiguous A/B test was the worst.  "Which is better?"  "They're the same!"  "No they aren't.  Which is better?"  "Arrgh!"</p><p>I also remembering doing a test where you have to look into what seems to be a table-mounted microscope.  Inside is a picture of a tree.  You were supposed to fiddle the knobs until the tree came into perfect focus for you.  When I finished that particular test the eye doctor got all sorts of pleased with himself.</p><p>"You don't have 20/20."<br>"Sure I do.  I can read the bottom line on the eye chart, can't I?"<br>"Nope, you actually have slightly worse than 20/20.  You need to get a prescription."<br>"Um, no.  I just want no-prescription zombie eyes, thanks."<br>"We can't do that.  You need prescription lenses.  You don't have 20/20."<br>(At this point I know he is lying -- like there's some legal requirement that I have 20/20 to buy lenses?)<br>"Okay, explain to me how I don't have 20/20 if I can read the 20/20 line on the eye chart?"<br>"Your eyes don't have 20/20 optics, but your brain is interpolating so that it thinks it can see in 20/20."<br>(He thought that bringing the word optics into the conversation would sound technical and scare me ... but my grandfather is an optical physicist.  Wrong tactic.)<br>"I don't have 20/20 optics, huh?"<br>"Nope.  Closer to 20/30."<br>"And yet ... my brain is somehow magically figuring it all out and fooling itself into being able to read 20/20."<br>"Something like that."<br>"Then I am effectively 20/20."<br>"No, you are not."<br>"Look.  I am going to spend $100 for these lenses.  I can do it here, or I can do it somewhere else."</p><p>Conversation over.  To this day, I have no idea what kind of crack he was smoking, or what kind of scam he was trying to pull.</p></div>

You'll quickly notice the benefits of having a top-flight doctor with top-flight equipment - it's a world of difference.</p><p>I've gotten drastically different prescriptions when examined by the fresh-out-of-college entry level doctors/techs at the chain stores, and suffered for years with contacts and glasses that weren't right for me at all - I was even diagnosed with slight astigmatism at a Walmart Eyecare and suffered consistent headaches for over a year until I was out of disposable contacts again.
