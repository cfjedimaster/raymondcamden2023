		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh, the edit functionality will be awesome for me. Too many people filling out forms don't put in proper email addresses and at my work we get a ton of undeliverable mail so having this inside of SpoolMail is going to help administer that much easier.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>I would love to see the option to edit what mail server the message will use when re-spooled. I need a way to actually send the message that SpoolMail capture to a real mail server and have it delivered to a real email address. <br>Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have used the edit feature in the past.  I even sent a patch to that effect sometime last year but it proved to not work on the MAC version of CF. Many times email is undeliverable due to a typo in the server info or a bad email address.  The ability to fix these issues without accessing the box on the file level would be great.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks, Ray!  VERY handy utility and, yes, it is installed on all my production boxes.  Saves me MANY headaches from folks who either a) can't fill out a form properly b) don't know what their e-mail address is c) are spammers</p></div>
