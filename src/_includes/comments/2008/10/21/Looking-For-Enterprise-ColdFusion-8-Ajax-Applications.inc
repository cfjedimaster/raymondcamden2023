		<div class="comment_text"><p>Get ready for the fire storm Ray...</p><p>So honestly, I fell in love with the Ajax stuff (all of it) at the beginning.  And to tell you the truth, good or bad, if I were still programming intranet apps at my company I'd have to say I'd use the sh*t out of them.  Simplicity, power, ease of training coworkers - all +1's when it comes to intranet developing with less experienced coworkers and short intervals for massive applications.</p><p>But...since I don't write stuff @ work anymore, I have to agree that jQuery (and a bit of Spry) is my drug of choice for Ajax nowadays.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh...yeah...hell yeah...</p><p>That's what i get for skimming the post.  JSON/CFC enhancements are huge in my book - even for jQuery/other ajax - the enhancements are fantastic.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,</p><p>I've tried a couple of different things with the CF8 ajax stuff.  The main thing I found was that it's easy to get a site 'working' but it's when you want to tweak certain behaviours that it gets more complicated and somewhat easier to just go back to a more standard website.</p><p>I also found that loading all the javascript can be slow, and therefore if i'm using the CF8 stuff, I try and preload some of it on previous pages if at all possible.</p><p>Mat</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've used the CF8 widgets mostly for Intranet applications.  I think the page download size when including all of the extjs libraries can be an issue for some public websites.  I have built a "single page" web (intranet) app with CF8 and this causes an up-front download hit but after that everything is pretty quick.  I would like to see more customization options available for appearance tweaks - it is tedious - but possible with Firebug - to dig into the extjs js and css and figure out what to override, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have built a few large scale apps using the CF8 Ajax framework and have had good results once I got past the learning curve.  I can't really share them with the readers of this blog as all of the apps are secure, corporate extranet apps used by my clients and their customers but I can say that I have built a file/report management app, a billing application (fed data by a commercial WMS app) and I have 3 other large projects in various stages all using CF8 Ajax.<br>Next year I will re-release Convergence, the app that I entered in the Best of Scorpio contest.  This was an app that was dominated by Flash Forms as it was originally written using CFMX 7.  I've been slowly rewriting it using CF8 and AJAX with pieces of Spry sprinkled in where necessary.  When I get done with that I would be more than happy to show it to anyone who wants to take a look at it.  It is a collaboration tool focusing on audited secure file transfer via a user portal, document management and some content management, exchange/sharepoint integration, etc.</p></div>
