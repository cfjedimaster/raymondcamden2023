		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not sure if you're aware of this, but Marvel is the company behind all the movies now.  In the past, movie companies would go to Marvel to license the properties.  Iron Man was Marvel's first attempting at being totally in control.  And every movie since then has been Marvel (The Hulk, the forthcoming Thor, Nick Fury, etc).  Once all the solo chars are introduced, the Avengers movie will be coming out.</p><p>Marvel has really stepped up now.  You can tell.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lady in the Water wasn't one of my favorites either.  I liked it a lot more after I saw the back story on it.  The whole thing grew out of bed time stories that he would tell his kids. I thought that was pretty cool.  My kids really like the movie.</p><p>The Happening might not be happening until DVD for me.  If it's that bad, there's no reason to waste a baby sitter and a date night on a 'rusty nail in the eye' movie.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i'd be interested in knowing how you get the nail in your eye head first if you're thinking of watching the film again and decide to do the nail thing instead.  i assume you're not talking a standard 16 penny nail, but perhaps a finishing nail that is virtually headless.</p><p>btw... what would you use to oxidize your nail that caused it to smell?  i've never known of a rusted nail to be smelly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am looking forward to Kung Fu Panda. I love Jack Black, but I don't always love the stuff he does... I still wince when someone mentioned El Nacho Libre :) He seems like he would be great for Animation in the way that Robin Williams was perfect for Aladin. Hopefully I can get to it this weekend.</p></div>
