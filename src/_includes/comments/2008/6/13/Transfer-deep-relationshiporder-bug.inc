		<div class="comment_text"><p>"sometimes I love bugs that take hours of debugging and head scratching to solve."</p><p>I'm the same way, depending on the situation.  If it's code that I wrote, and it's an interesting problem, it's fun.  But if it's dealing with a Microsoft product that is misbehaving, like a SQL Server bug, it is NOT fun at all...I think it's because I know that more often than not, there will be no solution for the problem, other than waiting for Microsoft to fix it with an upcoming patch, IF they decide to fix it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just to clarify - <br>This is only a bug IF and ONLY IF the column names on the Age column has exactly the same name.</p><p>If they are different named columns, you'll never have the issue.</p><p>This is because Transfer tries to re-use column names, so that queries aren't even wider than they already are.</p></div>
