		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you mow the lawn, don't you? take a shower? go grocery shopping? work out?   ;-D</p><p>Those are various times that I listen to podcasts. If you think about it, you'd be surprised how much "dead time" you can fill!</p><p>A commute to work is certainly the biggest and easiest target though. My drive to work is only 15 min so that's why I've filled my time during some of the other activities I mentioned above.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I go for a walk every morning (in theory at least).  That is when I listen to podcasts.  It's a good way to start the morning.</p><p> I also listen when I drive to clients, which really only happens a couple times of month (tops), but it is nice to have something other than radio to listen to in the car.</p></div>
