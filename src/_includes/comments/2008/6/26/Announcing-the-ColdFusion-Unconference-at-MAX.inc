		<div class="comment_text"><p>At the same time. So obviously folks have to decide what sessions they want to go to - one of the unconference ones or one of the 'official' ones. I see this as just offering more choices. I think having too much to choose between is a 'good' problem. :)</p></div>

I can do something on the Unitrin rewrite and issues we ran into refactoring to OOP at that scale or I can run a CF+OOP fundamentals session.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great news, Ray. Glad to see it. There are plenty of topics that could interest CFers of a variety of skill levels that might not generate enough traffic to win a spot in the real conferences, so this is a great alternative.</p><p>As you're taking volunteers, I'm willing both to assist however I can (thanks for your occasional guest hosting on the CF Meetup!),and I'd certainly like to propose to speak. I don't have any one topic but could pull from a large number. I also plan by then to have something that could be very important to show which could be of interest to most CFML shops. I'll let the suspense build from that. :-) But if you do ultimately choose to have me speak, I'll really look forward to it.</p><p>Thanks for this and all your efforts.</p></div>
