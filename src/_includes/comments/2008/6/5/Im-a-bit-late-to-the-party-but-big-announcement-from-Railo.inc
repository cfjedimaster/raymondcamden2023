		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought it was pretty easy to setup.  The installer worked just fine (I was on windows).  I also used it on ubuntu by running their Railix model, which is just a directory, and then you execute a <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frailostart.sh%3ATNez2xf-4KaE9nQxJ4EOfCNEXQw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="railostart.sh">railostart.sh</a> file.  Pretty simple, although I do have to admit their documentation could use some improvement.</p><p>The Engine however, is phenomenal.  Although it does not have all the features of Adobe's engine, it makes up for it in speed, and robustness.  Its a bit more tolerant then the other engines (which is a good or bad thing depending on your opinion).  But it does save time - little things like not having to declare local var variables in cffunctions at the very top saves time and aggravation.</p><p>The speed of course, is their niche, and is 2nd to none.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm running one of my client's sites on a VPS with Railo now, and found it easy enough to install. The speed is quite impressive and the support excellent. It really has some neat features and they are very responsive to the user community as well. As mentioned, the ability to push out hotfixes quickly is really great. A number of times I would send in a bug report and within a day they would have an update available that corrected it. I'm really excited to see where this goes with it now being open sourced.</p></div>
