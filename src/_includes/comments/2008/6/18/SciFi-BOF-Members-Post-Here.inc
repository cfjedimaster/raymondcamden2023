		<div class="comment_text"><p>The mantle of SF includes fantasy and the sort, at least according to most physical book stores I've been in. But that's not the point. Science fiction is not always about science and I can point to a number of SF writers who's works are considered SF but would be considered fantasy by many.</p><p>On the other hand, there are people who would question if Lost is SF. Is the science the central point? Is it science? While Supernatural and Reaper are not science based at all, what would you consider Heroes?</p><p>Now that I reread what I just wrote, I see I may be a little defensive. I guess I see SF from a slightly broader perspective.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I really enjoyed the discussion. Thank you for letting me attend, even though I don't watch BSG. ;) I don't know much about comics or graphic novels, so that was interesting.</p><p>I like Steve Alten (Domain, Meg, The Loch, etc). Reading Domain right now and it has been a really interesting take on the Mayan Doomsday Clock. Definitely a sci-fi twist.</p><p>My husband really likes Michael Moorcock and Philip K. Dick, so I'll recommend those on his behalf. How to Survive a Robot Uprising is one we both really liked. Loved the Hobbit and am looking forward to that movie.</p><p>One thing I didn't say during our brief Star Wars discussion is this: I'm pretty irritated that a Clone Wars movie is being made instead of the third trilogy. I was promised a trilogy of trilogies when I was a young girl in love with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo (who am I kidding... I still am! ;). So I want to see that last trilogy, darnit! That being said, I'll probably still go see the movie and watch the other Clone Wars episodes that were mentioned.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Michael Dinowitz:<br>I didn't mean to disparge the discussion.  It was interesting to me, but also reflected a dark side and made me wonder if I was out of place.  I like SF as a genre, but not familiar with a lot of the dark stuff discussed and quite frankly was unconfortable.  I was uncomfortable from the standpoint that I would like to believe the developer community was a big tent and was open to people from all faith backgrounds.  To me, an evangelical (moderate to progressive viewpoint, however), I felt out of place and wondering if this was representative of the community.</p><p>This is just where I was coming from.  Again, I do like SciFi and the concepts that often become reality.  I am not sure if the out-of-the box thinking of the genre drives people to invent or make come true the things they envision, or if the inventions are independent.  To me, yesterday's Sci-Fi is often today's reality.  The automatic opening doors or handheld communicator of the original Star Trek may seem cheesy now, but it wasn't even thought of by the public when Star Trek originally aired.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@tc - Its interesting you bring up Star Trek in your comment. I think one of the things that sets ST apart from - shoot - almost all SciFi, is how not-dark the view was. I mean sure you had plenty of wars and all that, but it seemed to always have a theme of 'we will be better in the future'. That's something we shoulda talked about last night. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The dark stuff part evolved from Hollywood's use of comic material to feed their mill. The thing is, they've done the dark many times but few realize that it was from comics (and the movies usually sucked):<br>300, sin city, constantine, v for vendetta, league of extraordinary gentlemen, etc.</p><p>You just had the bad luck to be in the room with people who know the dark and can talk about it (ok, it could be said that being in a room with me in general is bad luck. :)</p><p>Comic books are a great way for producers to 'test the waters' of a concept and if the concept already exists they'll take it. Dark is a sure sell to them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had recommended "Lord of Light" by Zelazny, which is easily one of the best books I have ever read.  Quite short, but the concepts within it, and the sense of a back story that is impled rather than told, is incredible. It's a retelling of a classic story of siddhartha, set in a sci-fi background.</p><p>I'd also recommend any of the Tales of Known Space stories, by Larry Niven, including (in no particular order) Neutron Star, Protector, Ringworld, etc.</p><p>Or maybe the Riverworld books by Philip Farmer.  The first is "To Your Scattered Bodies Go".  Imagine an entire planet terraformed into one long river, and all of the population of the world throughout history bring to life upon its banks, left to interact with each other.  Many famous people make an appearance, including Mark Twain, Sir Richard Francis Burton, Alice Hargreves (basis of Alice in Wonderland) and many others.  Seven books, all very good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Michael,<br>Thanks for the response.  I was kind of lost how the topic turned into so much discussion on comic books.  I missed the transition.  Maybe I am a bit like Sheldon on Big Bang Theory (i.e., how the other geeks had to hold up sarcasm signs to let him know when they were being sarcastic).</p><p>Ray,<br>I agree the original Star Trek did explore a lot was its themes, which not only had the positive outlook on future, but also tackled some forbidden issues of the day (like interracial relationships, racism).  It also had some of the alt-history concepts, like when the crew land on a planet where the Roman Empire didn't fall.</p></div>

Folks like Scott Sigler, J.C. Hutchins and Mur Laferty have some good stuff. Many of these are in serial format, getting a new part every couple of weeks.</p><p>I don't much like audio books, but since I have very little time to read anymore, I'm actually starting to come around on the whole podcasting book thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I also enjoyed the discussion, at least until it deteriorated into a pseudo-analysis of obscure comic books.  I was also disappointed that there weren't any Star Trek fans in the room.  I'm a HUGE fan of Star Trek: Voyager which is currently in syndication on Spike TV.  And whoever said it above is right, Star Trek's vision of the future is very bright indeed and that is precisely why there are so many die-hard Trekkers like me.  ;-)</p><p>By far my favorite movie of recent vintage is Cloverfield.  It was such a refreshing change to have a horror movie with no soundtrack and shown entirely from a participant's (i.e., victim) point of view.  The entire point of the movie is that you know only what those affected know, no more, no less.  When you hear loud crashes, booms, explosions, shrieks, etc. no explanation is given and you must make the correct decisions without any additional information, just like the characters in the movie.  That's an interesting and compelling twist for a horror movie.  BTW, I just saw that the movie is now available on FiOS On Demand.  Looks like I'll be seeing it again tonight.  :-)</p><p>As for books, my favorite all-time sci-fi/fantasy genre book is the Lord of the Rings and also the Silmarillion.  I've read the Silmarillion at least 4 times in the past ten years and every time it just gets better than the last.  Highly recommended.</p><p>Thanks, Ray, for bringing us together to share thoughts on one of our fav subjects.</p></div>
