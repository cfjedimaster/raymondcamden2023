		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are plenty of CF developers, just not good ones.  Good developers tend to migrate over to java or .NET.  I am not say all good developers, but many of them do.  CF needs to find a way to keep these developers stick.  One of the problem I notice is that on average a senior java developer gets paid about $20k more than a senior CF developer.</p></div>

In other languages that I've worked with, the finally block can be very useful.  As you'd expect, the code inside there gets executed whether an exception was thrown or not.  The catch is that if there WAS an exception, then the code acts as if the exception gets raised again after the finally block is complete.  It was something that I missed quite a bit when I moved over to ColdFusion back in version 4.5... :-)  I can't wait for it...</p><p>-Andy</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was hoping for an complete simplifying of the language. Right now we going backwards when CF added AJAX. We need to stay in one place and still get all features of javascript or even JavaFX. &lt;cfhttp should have the option to return an Array or a cfquery. Thanks for adding that for cffile! You need &lt;cfimap&gt;, &lt;CFclassloader for hot updates. For example the MySQL driver has a bug for CF 8 so I loaded a newer driver then the ISP is willing to and I get around the slow update problem. CF could even hot update this way too. &lt;cfpaypal tag I thought was going in, what happened to that? Simplified way to hide the fact a gateway is even being used at all. Giving away software will not do it, we need more teachers who know CF.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan, you have a lot of comments here. I'll try to parse them as best as possible.</p><p>CF+Ajax is Backwards: I strongly disagree. After teaching CF8/Ajax about 10 times now, I can tell you that for people who are not yet knowledgeable about JS or AJAX, the new features make it _super_ easy. As it stands, if it is a feature you don't like, don't use it. It doesn't bring CF backwards if you don't like a feature.</p><p>cfhttp should have array/query results: Um, you can return a query with cfhttp. Not sure an array makes sense though.</p><p>cfclassloader: Check out the javaloader project by Mark Mandel at RIAForge.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would like to see all object-oriented features in ColdFusion. Then only we can attract other developers to CF, else CF will be under-rated. The first query they ask is "is CF a complete objec-oriented language?" and we can't say "yes it is". I know CF is positioned as a rapid development tool and it also helps non-programmers to develop DB driven apps. But our community now comprises of lot of object-oriented developers (Thanks to MVC frameworks) and CF should also satisfy them. So my suggestion is keeping the same Rapid development objective (otherwise CF's purpose will be lost, every body will move to Java :) ) CFML should support all object-orieneted features that Java offers. Also built-in Spring and Hibernate features.</p></div>
