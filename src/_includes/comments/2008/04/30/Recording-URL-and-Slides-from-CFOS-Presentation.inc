		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray (as usual)!<br>The reference I made to Scott Pinkston contributing to BlogCFC during the early part of the presentation was to give an example of how someone can contribute to an Open Source project.</p><p>I wanted you to kind of use that as a success story and maybe tell how it came about.  Did he just send you an email with the code, or was there a conversation before folding it into the base?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw your comment just didn't have throughput at the time. ;)</p><p>If I remember right, Scott did the right thing, and by 'right' I of course mean what is right for me. He told me first what he wanted to do, then sent the code so I could just paste it in. He went out of his way to make the process easier.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As is the case with a lot of software, I got tired of remembering to edit the layout.cfm so it grew out of need.  I also remember seeing several blog posts mentioning upgrading BlogCFC with the same standard pods.  Couple of days (or hours) later and folks would have new pods or a different order to their pods.  I thought it was something that I needed but also thought others might use it as well.  I sent Ray an email describing what I did and briefly went over very few changes needed to add the code in.  I didn't send him any code or attachments at first thinking that if he was interested in seeing the code he would ask for it.  I also asked Ray for his permission to release the code if he wasn't interested.</p><p>Some advice I would pass on to other folks wanting to contribute it to try and make the addition something that can easily be tested, only include the files necessary for the mod, and if changes are made to the core code highlight exactly what you changed with lines numbers.  True they can diff to see the changes but you are trying to sell them something.  Do the heavy lifting for them.  *TRY* to follow the code style of the project.  The less they have to figure out the better your odds are.  Lastly, if your mod takes hours to try then chances are the OS developers won't have the time to try it out.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></div>
