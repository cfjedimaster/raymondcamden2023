He was all like (adam sandler voice) "spaces are better, they make the code look all nice and clean" and I was all like "tabs are better, they make the code byte size smaller and make switching IDE's easier".

I've been called that by the junior programmers on a great deal because of the way I tend to "nitpick" their coding "conventions" such as they are.

Appropriate Field and Table naming conventions in a database as well (Tables always start with "tbl" and Fields should always start with "fld" so things are easily identifiable).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I'm certainly a diva when it comes to database stuff.  I can't tell you how many developers I've PO'd over the years by renaming tables and columns -- after they have written code against their own names.</p><p>Even worse is when see database structural/design errors long after coding has begun.    mea culpa... should have looked harder, earlier.</p><p>off the cuff, my  rules would include these...<br> - table names should be plural (customers, not customer).  <br> - every table should have a autopopulated column called create_timestamp.  CF developers must ignore this, and let the database provide the value.<br> - column names and table names are all lower case, and words separate with underscores.  (underscores are no better than dashes, or camel case, but the others are no better either. )<br> - db tables should have only one primary key -- and almost always an automatically generated integer.  Generally, the primary key should be table name +  '_id'.  (e.g. customer_id)<br>- with the execption of the primary key, there is generaly no reason to repeat the table name in column names.  (you should not have a column name 'customer_name' in the customer table -- 'name' is sufficient.<br> - don't over normalize.<br> - If CF is your applicaton platform, you gotta use CFCs to access the db -- because we may change the db structure tomorrow for business reasons, and we don't want to have tell the business users that "we can't really do that in a reasonable amount of time"<br>-- thats a start... one more beer and I'll by grinding them out all night.</p><p>My rationale is that the right choice of application languages such as CF and Flex and PHP (for you two) change over the years.  So too IDEs. But SQL databases have been around for a very long time, and will likely be around a whole lot longer.  Database is the place to be a diva -- CF, not so much.</p><p>And, admittedly, many of my rules have no better foundation than "that's the way we've always done it, and the arguments for consistency are currently stronger than the arguments for changing the standards."  (therefore, my standards don't apply to your shop, and therefore, its pointless to debate them.  And the corelary is -- new programmers should not bring the baggage of their history into my shop's applications-- it has enough baggage already ;-))</p><p>Ron</p></div>

And  if, perchance, you read quickly, it's not only convenient but becomes much faster than the overhead of memory-recognition and saving yourself x keystrokes.</p><p>This is where I start to sound crazy. I make other developers use the same IDE (Dreamweaver CS3--8 is acceptable if you're a die-hard Luddite), file organization strategy, and EVEN CODE COLORING and font.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I drive my fellow developers nuts with my puritan way of coding. And I'm allergic to whitespace in my HTML ;-) Except where needed of course for nice indentations! Most of the things you describe I do too. For production machines I usually run a script in the Application.cfc that strips ALL whitespace from the code, generating a minimal footprint - it does mean that inline JS needs a CDATA block, otherwise that will break. On developer boxes I share with fellow developers I have lately let off a bit on my principals in the nature of keeping the peace. So yes I should be considered a diva, but also a Standardista.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A while back I worked for a company who brought in a new DBA. New here means he was new to SQL 2005 but had seen 2000 and was more comfortable with DB2 and Oracle.  His first official act was to add these rules and their reasons:</p><p>RULE: All SQL will be in lower case.<br>REASON: I simply don’t like mixed or upper case.  Looks like shouting or yodeling.</p><p>RULE: All column names will be surrounded with [ ].<br>REASON: Some people like create tables with spaces or reserved words in the name best to be safe because I don’t know all the reserved words.</p><p>RULE: All table names will be fully qualified.<br>[ServerName].[database name].[user name].[table name].<br>REASON: We only have one database now but we could have more and we might connect to both in the same query some day.</p><p>RULE: Every sql statement will be free of tabs or carriage returns and written as one continuous line. Run them through the query editor in management studio.<br>REASON: Because formatting slows down code processing.</p><p>RULE: Any sql other than a simple select without joins will be rewritten as a stored procedure or view.<br>REASON: ColdFusion isn’t a Database and doesn’t understand these complexities.</p><p>RULE: Always use a UUID as the Primary key.<br>REASON: Even though Gender only contains male and female there could some day be more than that and we could wind up having more records than an INT can handle.</p><p>There were more but those I am certain of. The Employee to management relations degraded after that ad most of the coders left.</p><p>I’m all for standards.  I like having FK_ in front of my foreign keys, and I like having _ID at the end of my Primary keys, but I don’t HAVE to have it that way.  I like carriage returns and tabs, it makes reading easier, but I’m ok with using Dream Weaver’s code formatter too.  Camel Case for the win!</p></div>

And the traumas I had with VB.NET (if I can speaketh of such things on this blog without the wrath of Raymond smiting me) and how the code was constructed, I thought tearing out my veins one by one with those little Swiss Army knife tweezers would be preferable.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hate code that screams at me.  I don't mind "compareNoCase" or "CompareNoCase" but I can't stand "SELECT" or "COMPARENOCASE".  I don't care if all the stinkin' CF and SQL examples out there have it.  With modern editors there's no need for it.</p><p>But really many of those things are about using a code beautifier instead of making developers change ever little habit until the next job.  Let them do their thing as much as possible and have the beautifier take care of making the code consistant for future generations.</p></div>
