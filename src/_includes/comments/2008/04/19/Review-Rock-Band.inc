		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love rock band too.  My wife prefers to use our old GH guitar over the RB one.  Drums take a bit to get used to (the kick drum) but are so much fun.  Singing and playing drums is VERY hard, at least for me.  Really fun at parties.  We have trouble finding a place to put all the stuff away though.  Small house, need to buy a new house to just for a play room!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rock Band is awesome.  I found the drums pretty easy (although I only tried hard for 10-15 songs).  However I used to be a drummer years ago (so that kinda helped).  Singing is pretty easy on Expert (albeit you have to sing the songs incorrectly in order to get a perfect score... It's more fun to sing the songs on Medium so you can sing more naturally and get them correct).  The GH guitar is definitely better to use on RB.  I'm glad they support it.</p><p>Maybe I'll see you online sometime and we can jam :).  I haven't played the game that much, but it's always fun and great for parties.  I wonder if Jared will have one setup at cf.objective (that would be cool).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just played RB again tonight over at Aaron West's house and had a great time. Sadly it was just the two of us, but it was still great fun. I actually enjoyed using the mike, and was impressed by how on key you have to be.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Guitar Hero vs Rock Band. It's beginning to look like Mac vs PC. So, that would make me a PC 'cause I love Guitar Hero. I own and have played through every GH game (up to Medium). I love the mix of old classics and new rock and I love the 80's version (I survived college on those songs).</p><p>Then I tried Rock Band. I failed. I knew that couldn't be that bad so I tried again. I did better but I still love the GH guitar. I really do care about the four player capabilities, I'm usually playing alone anyway. I play video games to have fun not to compete. My daughter like RB better but I think that's because she can do better at RB than I can.</p><p>So just as my household uses both Mac and PC, it looks like we will be both a GH and RB household. However I must say that one of the things that GH has that RB doesn't have is more songs. GH has been around much longer.</p><p>For those GH fans - GH - Aerosmith is going to RULE!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not only is GH: Aerosmith coming out, but so is GH: On Tour for the DS, GHIV in the fall, and the Wii is finally getting Rock Band.  I'm going to have to get a third job to support all this Guitar Hero goodness ;).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Raymond:</p><p>I actually move the kick pedal off to the right of the drumset and just leave it on the floor. While this means it's not on the metal bar it's designed to be on, it feels way more natural to me.</p><p>The only real problem I had with this is the curly cord tends to pull the kick pedal at first. To solve this, I just hung the kick pedal in my closet when not using it until it stretched out enough that it didn't cause a problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dan and @Ray,</p><p>I did one better than Dan. I notched out the foot of the drum set (dremel tool) so that the kick pedel slides a little under it off to the right on the outside. I'm tall too and this felt better to me.</p><p>Oh, and I bought real sticks and a real drum throne... :-)</p></div>
