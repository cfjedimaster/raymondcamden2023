		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the alert Ray.</p><p>This is *very* impressive of Abobe. The bugs fixed and features added is very reassuring, especially in terms of the Ajax support. Good to see some of the core libraries updated (Ext 1.1.1 for example) but a shame they can't update to Ext 2 - though I imagine that would be quite a change internally.</p><p>I'm very impressed by the FCK editor improvements. I have been using TinyMCE on a project I'm working on but may very well change to the built in FCK editor due to now having alot more customisation options. In 8.0.0 it wasn't really flexible enough and lacked easy uploading and flash support etc. It now seems much better.</p><p>Awesome work by Adobe - especially in terms of 64bit support. That will help massively when I come to deploy the site I'm working on as it could benefit from &gt;4GB memory down the line, as well as potential performance increases.</p><p>Talking of which, I wonder what kind of performance improvements we might see on a 64bit platform...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are still some issues left to fix I notice. Overall, however, the amount of effort by Adobe seems to show they are very committed to the product, which is great.</p><p>SYS-CON must be rolling in CF's empty grave :)</p></div>
