		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with the previous poster about Coldbox.  I had started frameworks with simple MVC (homegrown).  But as I would bang my head on the wall with MachII and Model-Glue, I found Coldbox to be extraordinarily easier.  Just the built-in layout tools alone make it work my time.  It has built-in integration to Coldspring and Lightwire, the latest version has a security system in it to, with the ability to use the framework's security object or build your own with certain expected calls and return types.  Luis just keeps adding and adding and adding new features to the framework.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, my full time job is taking up so much of my time that my side projects, using Coldbox, always have to take a back seat!  If only there were more hours in the day!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I built my first "large" ColdFusion application without a framework because, well, I never heard of frameworks at the time. This was probably about 10 years ago. As the application became larger, tracking down bugs became more difficult because of the dependency of one page from the previous and to the next. It would often take me 15 minutes or so to even begin trying to determine where the source of the problem lay.</p><p>Then I discovered Fusebox. I rewrote the same application using that framework and maintenance became much easier. It was now much simpler to find the source of a bug. I used Fusebox for my next application, and used Mach-ii for my latest (and by far the largest) application. I'm a Mach-ii guy, but to each his own.</p><p>In any case I would never consider building an application---unless trivial in size---without a framework. Yes, the initial development takes longer, but the payback in maintenance more than makes up for it. My Mach-ii application has over 400 event handlers, and trying to maintain an application that large without a solid methodology would be frighteningly difficult.</p></div>

There is plenty of visuals, helps those who maybe new to the whole framework, design pattern, and OO approach.</p><p>This in my mind is what separates Coldbox from the rest.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started off with Model-Glue because I figured "hey -- if it's good enough for Ray...". I worked through his tutorial and Dan Wilson's on MG2. I was feeling pretty comfortable with it EXCEPT for the fact that you use an XML file for the application flow, which seemed weird to me. But I figured I was stuck with it since MachII and Fusebox (at the time) also used XML.<br>Then, I discovered ColdBox and I haven't looked back. The only problem I'm having now is trying to figure out what size application is too "trivial in size" (as joel put it) to "rate" using a framework. I guess in the back of my mind I'm always considering the possibility that a even small application will someday get bigger.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the sentiments are still dead on. To a few specific points:</p><p>1) I no longer use Transfer. I use ORM in CF9. Technically I still "use" Transfer at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FCFLib.org%3AWOdcErJNG97LPvefvtc2ezLtDsI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="CFLib.org">CFLib.org</a>, but for new dev, it's all orm.</p><p>2) I still recommend Model-Glue, but I also really, REALLY dig Framework 1 by Sean Corfield.</p></div>
