		<div class="comment_text"><p>Even if you don't use WuFoo for actually constructing a form, I love it for helping with the skinning of forms.  There are a bunch of pretty cool themes to choose from, and it's nice to see something like an end result of color combinations before actually diving into coding it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The discussion is an interesting one, however we kind of think that a form needs to do more than just display and report on data with a chart. Our approach is that the data is the most important reason for creating a form in the first place so to make that a reality you need a decent backend to effectively do more with the data. We think you should be able to create a form to elicit data and then make that data available to other processes as needed. Sometimes it might be a simple spreadsheet but other time sit might be a more usbale applciation, like CRM, ERP, Accounting, etc. We've built putoo in XML using the eXisat d/b XML engine and we can expose the collected data via Web Services to any other app that wants to grab the data. It's all too hard if you have to do the initial collection and then do it again if you want to reuse it in some otehr sorporate app.</p></div>
