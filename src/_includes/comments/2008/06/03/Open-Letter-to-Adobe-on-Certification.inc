		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>One of the questions I ask when interviewing is whether or not the person is certified. If they are, I ask them about the test, what they thought, etc. If they didn't, I ask them if they plan to (why or why not)... Their ideas on certification, motivations, and plans say a lot. So I don't necessary care if they are certified, but I use the certification process to start a discussion, and it leads to some very interesting answers. So I find it useful, but in my own way.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the Dreamweaver instructor issue: currently certified instructors can take a "recertification" exam that is shorter and that we can take online from home. The test is *supposed* to focus on the new features of the new version, but the Dreamweaver CS3 exam was all about AP Elements and frames and other stuff that no modern developer should ever use. There wasn't, for example, a single question on Spry, which I consider to be the most significant new feature in CS3.</p><p>But that point aside ... yes, Adobe did eventually listen to us and say that instructors didn't have to take the test, but they made this announcement *one day* before the deadline to take it. So they waited until the last possible moment - until pretty much everyone who was going to have to take the test had already done so - before making the announcement. Yes, they let off the hook those who had failed the test and would therefore possibly be unable to continue teaching, but they offered nothing by way of compensation to those who may have had to take the test multiple times in order to pass it. So even this was at best a half-measure.</p><p>In addition, as you pointed out, the amnesty only applied to currently certified instructors. If I was someone who was trying to advance my career and actually *become* a certified instructor for the first time, I would have no choice to but try to pass the test. It's totally unconscionable that they are continuing to offer and market the test, and that they have done nothing to offer refunds or other compensation to those who were in essence forced to take the exam before they acknowledged the error.</p><p>I'm actually in the situation outlined above right now with other products. I am already certified in DW and Flash and a few others (although I was only able to just barely pass the DW test, and I can guarantee that it was only because of the poorly written questions), but I want to become a certified instructor for both ColdFusion and Flex. In order to do so, I will have to take and pass both of those exams. Thankfully, like you I'm now in a position where I can take them for free, so it's only a matter of my time, but I truly feel for those who do have to pay.</p><p>What's clear is that this is a deeply rooted, systemic problem at Adobe. We can now safely agree that there are three deeply flawed CS3 exams - DW, CF, and InDesign (Adobe actually pulled the ID exam and rewrote it because of the complaints.) I took and passed the Flash CS3 exam, and while it wasn't as bad as DW, it couldn't reasonably be called good by any standard. From what I can tell on their site, they currently offer exams in 10 products, so fully 25% of them are flawed, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the number is actually higher.</p><p>Adobe needs to decide if the certification process is something that they are going to take seriously or not. If so, then it's time for the company to decide to invest in the tests and bring it in house. Go out to the community and get actual experts to help write the tests, but keep the quality control in house. And make sure that the quality control is really there.</p><p>And by the way, I don't see criticisms like this to be attacks on Adobe, but rather well-deserved negative feedback for one particular department at Adobe that is simply not doing its job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As someone who isn't very good at taking exams I regard them as second class qualifications against demonstratable practical experience. If you can memorised a reference manual (I think this is true for some Microsoft exams) then you should be able to pass. My memory is bad and I sometimes refer to cfQuickDocs when coding new stuff. Does that make me an unsuitable candidate for a CF job?</p><p>I wouldn't want to employ people who have a 500Gb drive plugged into their brain, I prefer creative people who can wow me with their portfolio and clever pieces of code.</p><p>If Ray got 92% then the questions need adjusting until Ray can get 100%. Otherwise what chance do the rest of us have? (Of those who really feel they need to get certified)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm writing a Dreamweaver CS3 exam right now for an online testing company.  It's not as official or as difficult as a cert test, but it does help motivate you to learn a certain product in order to score well.</p><p>They take it seriously, using Instructional Design methods, and have hired people to review my outline plus questions.  I'm working on the test outside of my regular job and the validators are contract part-time as well.</p><p>I hadn't realized how hard it would be to actually write one of these babies.  Whenever I've taken a test, I can usually get through a question every 3 minutes.<br>But writing a question takes hours.  I've devoted entire Saturdays to writing a handful of test questions (and they need 150).<br>They ask for beginner, Intermediate and Advanced questions, but the Advanced questions aren't to be so obscure as to be considered a trick.  So someone who scores well on the test might be under the wrong impression that they aced it, when in reality it simply means they know the product pretty well.</p><p>So it more than a core competency test, but less than a certification test.<br>I'm definately in favor of testing.  It's a time to be honest with yourself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>On a side note - did Adobe ever add a page where you can view a list of certified developers?  I know right after I took my test that list disappeared from the Macromedia site and was gone for a long time.  I bought Forta's cert prep book for 7 but never got around to taking it and after reading this probably won't bother with 8 either.  Or maybe I should take it now while it's easy?? :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I put off taking CF 7 certification as when I felt comfortable taking it CF 8 was launching. Certification is fairly important to me as all of my work sits inside my workplace's intranet, so unless they are already interviewing me they are never going to see the work I do.</p><p>Thanks for pointing it out, I see no point for myself to take certification now if it is dodgy...

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Oliver - You said there was no way to communicate. When I took my cert, each question, shoot, even the pre and post stuff, had a Comments box. I used it quite often. Now - I'd be willing to bet I don't hear back, but there was a mechanism at least. The Flex cert didn't have that?</p><p>@All - Thanks for the comments so far.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My guess is that there's more at work here than just Adobe being bad... admittedly, with the community creating the content and someone else administering the program it's a big-time cash cow for Adobe, so I don't see them doing anything to interrupt the flow of money. On the other hand, since they're selling a faulty product to huge numbers of people, it's only a matter of time before someone spins up a class-action lawsuit against them. It's very confusing: why are they doing this?</p><p>I have been told, though, that even the certifications team has tried, internally, to create initiatives to fix it and their efforts have (some how, some way) been blocked. They don't want to have to go home ashamed of their jobs, I suspect... point is, there's more going on here than we're being told and my guess is that there's some heavy-duty legal issues behind the scenes that they CAN'T talk about. With this much chatter going on in the wild, they can't just be maintaining the status quo.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would have to agree Ray.  If you are going to have a certification test, it best be done right.  My issue with cert tests and most of ther online "knowledge" tets is that it looks like most of them were written not by a CF developer, but someone going through the CFWACK book looking for obscure information that the likes of you and Ben may not be fully familiar with because they are hardly used.  I find that they don;t test for practical knowledge...maybe an academic wrote them that is out of touch with the real world...who knows?</p><p>The problem does come in when employers either require or rely on these tests do determine employability.  I can remeber taking the Brainbench CF test for a recruiter for a consulting company.  I scored well on it, but many of the questions were about things in CFML that I have never onece used in my 10 years of CF expereince.  I have worked for a variety of companies/clients and developed a wide variety of apps from simple display pages to e-commecve apps.  So I should have used, at least a few time, even some of the obsure stuff, but some of this was outside of my knowldege.  The other thing, that others have brought up here, a measure of a developers worth is not on his abiloity to remeber every single tag/function or the details of each of those, but moreso on what tags/functions to use and where to look up the minutea when needed or where to look for what to use when needed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have hesitated adding to this thread but I can't do it any longer.</p><p>I have taken the DW CW3 ACE exams two times and have failed at both attempts. These two test are the only two tests that i have ever failed in my life, and I'm 46.</p><p>The tests were poorly written and contained questions on things that any professional designer/developer should never use. There were questions on outdated technology.</p><p>On the first test that I took in Feb 2008 I received the following scroes:</p><p>Understanding Web technologies - 50%<br>Planning sites- 72%<br>Designing pages - 58%<br>Managing and maintaining sites- 45%</p><p>My overall score was 59 with a 64 being a passing grade.</p><p>On the test that I took today I had the following scores:</p><p>Understanding Web technologies - 50%<br>Planning sites- 66%<br>Designing pages - 47%<br>Managing and maintaining sites- 72%</p><p>My overall score was 58 with a 64 being a passing grade.</p><p>I cannot, on good faith, recommend to anyone that they take this test.</p><p>On a lighter note, I am a frequent poster to the Adobe Dreamweaver and ColdFusion forums so if I recommend a solution to you, be aware that I am a failure!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is to Ken Ford. Ken, you are one of the people on the list I respect. Don't say the things you said in the last line of this post. You are great. I did take the test twice and somehow passed the second time, by 2 points, so I just eeked by myself.</p><p>I took 5 this time because I have to. I am an instructor and to keep that status with Adobe I have to be certified in the classes I teach.</p><p>In order of best to worst: (keep in mind they were all recert tests, and should only cover new features)<br>Photoshop, InDesign (a test they reworked), Illustrator, Flash, Dreamweaver. Sad. They aren't worth anything but I have to take them.</p><p>I did take Acrobat and it was the full test. I didn't pass. It was crazy hard and had many of the same questions, just worded differently. It's not like the others. You need 76% or more to pass, you have 67 questions and 75minutes to take the test. Something like that. I'll try again though.</p><p>Dee</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I can't argue or take exception to anything that Ray states.  I, too, long for the days of the ColdFusion certification program being under the wings of Allaire or Macromedia.  Adobe has been a major obstacle instead of what should be viewed as a win-win relationship.<br>However, if you do want to or have to (job promotion, training requirement, etc...) take the CF8 certification exam, you might want to consider getting CF8 Exam Buster which I just released (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcentrasoft.com%3A4a-48HFCgZ5DtDmQ6kW2-UOAr6c&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://centrasoft.com">http://centrasoft.com</a>).  I won't plug any further.  Thanks, Brian</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heaven help me, cause I know I am suppose to help people as an ACE, but honestly, was this last message a spam? @serel, forgive me, but even Ray here and most of us would have to look it up too. It's on Adobe's site and there is a search field. There is an exam certification page with all the info you need. My patience is thin today only because other intelligent people have asked similar questions to the list I subscribe to and could have done a search as easily as I can.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Ray.  I have yet to take the certification because of this.  Plus, I've purchased all the certification software/PDF's/online exams I could find... and after reviewing them, I see the same issues mentioned in this blog.  Here's my point of view:  A Coldfusion certification should be about, get this, Coldfusion!  I want to see 85% of the questions related to CF tags, CF functions, CF syntax, and CF Administrator.  The balance should be database oriented.  I see no value whatsoever in adding questions on HTML.  After all, most of what I code in my current web output is in CSS. So if you have HTML then you need to add CSS questions.  The truth of the matter is there should be NONE OF IT!  Lastly, why are there questions on server architecture? Or installing Coldfusion on a server.  I have worked for 9 years with Coldfusion at:  a small software company (Vurv Technology), a medium sized Security department inside a big company (Lockheed Martin), and a large company supporting the DOD (General Dynamics) on classified networks. I'm now a Sr. Coldfusion Developer. I have NEVER had anything to do with server administration or network administration. They hire people just for that.  Therefore, I have NEVER had to install Coldfusion on a server.  Those questions are ludicrous for someone who actually does Coldfusion programming for a living.   Make the exam a true Coldfusion certification by actually having real Coldfusion questions.  Also, any professional in any job would know not to have created an exam full of questions/answers spelled wrong… And any teacher would know not to have a question with multiple right answers. So wake up Adobe.</p></div>
