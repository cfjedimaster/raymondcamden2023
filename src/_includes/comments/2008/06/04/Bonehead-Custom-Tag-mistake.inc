		<div class="comment_text"><p>Had a similar situation years ago at a former job.  The common dev server that everyone used keep hanging 100% cpu.  I asked everyone to tell me what they were working on so I could see what was causing the problem.  Ended up going desk to desk and found that someone had made a page form.cfm and was trying to call a custom tag library that extended cfform call you guessed it cf_form.  So had a recursive loop going and boom there goes the server.</p></div>
