		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mike - it's not _that_ exciting. It was just my first, from scratch, use of Transfer. We use Transfer quite a bit at Broadchoice of course, but this was the first time I did it myself, and of course, I screwed it up a bit. That's the part I want to share mainly.</p><p>The site also uses MG3 and CS. It's rather simple though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Could you give a quick (if possible) comparison between transfer and reactor, why someone would choose one over the other if not simply because of personal choice and which you like better if you have used reactor?</p><p>Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just prefer Transfer. I haven't used Reactor in a while, but Transfer works better for me. Like just about everything else, I'd recommend what works best for you. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would LOVE to see a break down of the major appeal/features of each (Transfer and Reactor) and any pros/cons and things that longtime users of each argue as reasons to use one over the other.</p><p>Before I was introduced to the concept of an ORM I actually started developing my own from scratch. I thought I was inventing the concept. Then I found out about Reactor and paid another ColdFusion developer that uses it daily at his job to come over and demo it to me and walk me through the setup of a simple application. I was "uber" disappointed at how counter-intuitive and lengthy the setup process was, as well as the syntax used to implement its leveraging in the app itself once configured. It took almost 45 minutes just to get the thing ready to start coding an app.</p><p>Then I watched a few demos Mark Mandel did on Transfer, and was more impressed. It seems like Transfer is a more-mature, feature-rich and usable framework, can anyone confirm / deny that?</p></div>
