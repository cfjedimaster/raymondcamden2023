		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>The quality of the food has not got any better.  That you now have to pay for checking luggage on domestic flights just proves how badly the airlines are doing financially.  The discount fliers are killing the bigger airlines.</p><p>That pain you feel from someone putting back the seat shouldnt be blamed on the person in front of you trying desparately to get comfortable it should be blamed on the airline for makeing it comfortable only for people under 5'5" to fly.</p><p>In otherwords if the airlines actually gave a sh*t about passenger comfort and not about trying to squeeze a couple extra rows of seats on the plane you would have plenty of leg room.  But hey if you are flying cattle class you should expect to be treated as cattle right?</p><p>Cheaper is not better and those discount airlines, while they do indeed make money, they make it at the expense of comfort, and for a lot of people how they get there doesn't matter so long as they get there for the cheapest possible price.</p><p>I see no real end in sight, soon they will be charging extra to fill the cabin with breathable air.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Gary - I do put the blame on the airlines for the seat room. But, that doesn't excuse other passengers. I'm not going to discomfort the guy behind me so I can be 2% more comfortable. I'm going to be fair. Maybe I'm in the minority, but that's what I'll do.</p><p>@Kevin - I guess that makes sense. I just check my luggage. I bring one small carry on that I typically keep at my feet as it has my iphone and books.</p><p>Oh, and speaking of iphone. I filled mine up with 10 TV shows to watch for my long flight. I check it this morning and the dang battery had mysteriously drained over night. Luckily I'm in a 3 hour layover and it's already about 80% charged.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hear ya Ray.</p><p>As a fellow "tall-ish" person, I have a lot of trouble on long flights.  I saw your post just as I was on expedia looking for a flight for MAX, and trying to decide between discount, and regular airline flights.  I actually thought I would save some money and drive to the conference (Vancouver to San Francisco is a nice drive, and can be done in one long day).  I priced it out, and the gas alone would likely cost as much as a flight - and then there is parking.   I just may walk there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Could be worse... I bought my mother tickets to visit her sister in florida, it was $25 for the first checked bag, $35 for the second one, and $200 for the third.  Each way.</p><p>I loaned her my laptop case to jam her stuff into so she'd have a second "allowed" carryon and fedexed a few things she was taking down to give to my aunt.</p><p>But this was on a super cheap airline that just does flights from my town to vegas and tampa. I think the actual flight was 80 or 90 bucks each way, plus $20 or so in taxes and BS fees, not counting the lugage.</p><p>Depending on where you're traveling and how your time constraints are, sometimes it's better to take a train. They're much, much, much more comfortable and roomy, the food is way better, the prices are much cheaper... but they're very slow and can be unreliable. But if you're only going a few hundred miles, it might end up being close to a flight, since there's no security, few long lines, you just get on and off and show your tickets. Oh, and you're on the ground and no one freaks out if your celphone isn't turned off (though actually using them isn't particularly well-loved)</p></div>

Outside of that, you have to look at when it would get to your city of choice, i.e., is it overnight, does it arrive in the middle of the night, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the reclining seat issue, I look at it this way. Everyone paid for their seat, they have a right to all its features. I don't recline myself, but I don't get upset when someone else chooses to. And I am over 6 feet so it's a tough fit when they do.</p><p>My bigger gripes are that they don't have nearly tall enough seat backs unless you shell out for first class. It never feels good not having anyplace to rest my head back. And also the fat slob that spills over into the adjoining seats, which may be my #1 gripe. I am in favor of some people having to buy two seats if they are going to take up that much space. If I pay for a seat and only get to sit in half of it because Jumbo next to me can't stop eating a dozen doughnuts a day, that's a real problem.</p></div>
