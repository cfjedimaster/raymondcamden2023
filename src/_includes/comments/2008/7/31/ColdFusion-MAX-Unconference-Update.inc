		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've read through Terry's slides on the "hostile shop" presentation. It looks really good. I spoke with him about it at webmaniacs, and based on our conversation it seemed to me that seeing the presentation "Live" would be well worth it.</p><p>my 2 cents.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll second the request for Terry's preso. I heard a lot of good buzz about it, and had a look through the slides after CF.Objective().  I was bummed I couldn't see it in person then.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the votes guys. I think it's a good presentation, but I see Ray's point that it might be too far afield.</p><p>In any case, if spots need filling, and Ray puts it in, I'll try and reign the content in to be a little more CF specific.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think 2 votes is probably enough to convince me otherwise. TR, if you email me, or ping me me here, with a good time, I'll put you in. Since you will have 2 sessions, it will be on a short list of stuff to kill if we run out of space, but I think it's obvious folks want your sessions. :)</p></div>
