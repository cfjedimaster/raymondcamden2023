I could stay down there for hours!</p><p>The River Walk in San Antonio is amazing.  I spent a week there last year for work, and I can't remember a single bad meal.</p><p>All the road systems in the major cities in Texas seem to be setup with the one way access roads on each side(referred to as "feeder roads" here); GPS can be a savior in those situations!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Welcome back to steamy south Louisiana, Ray, although I guess it wasn't much cooler in Texas! Great to hear it was a good vacation. There's nothing like a good family vacation where the kids have a blast and the parents do, too!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ken - I still haven't gotten bit by the GPS bug. I've used GPS "lite" with my iphone I guess and that was nice. It would have helped this vacation.</p><p>@James - San Antonio was surprisingly mild. Austin was an oven. More like Vegas than Louisiana.</p><p>@Shane - Hey - maybe my presence is what helped push the hurricane more towards Mexico! ;) (Sorry Mexico.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Glad to hear you had a good time and most importantly had time to spend with your family.  I am sure your kids really appreciated the time.</p><p>I can't say much about Texas (or LA, for that matter).  I haven't visited that part of the country yet, even though my sister has lived in Austin since the early 80's.  Other than going through the Atlanta airport, the farthest south I have been is Tennessee and North Carolina.  One of my goals will be to visit all 50 states.  I believe I have 15 or so left to visit.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@CM - We ate at a mexican restaurant named... Antonio's I think. We ate there twice because it was near the hotel. I had those pork shanks downtown somewhere, but I forget the name. They made guacamole for us at our table which was pretty darn good too.</p><p>And now I'm back on the healthy food. Bah. ;) I can say I was pleasantly surprised when I got the scale. I didn't gain a pound. How in the heck that happened I have no idea.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The bats under the bridge in Austin are amazing! The C++ Committee met in Austin and we stayed in the hotel right next to that bridge so we got to watch it every night.</p><p>Austin has some great music venues and a lot of stuff to do in the evenings - it's a fun city. Never been to San Antonio tho'. My experiences of Texas have been Dallas (mainly), Houston, Austin and Waco but I'll be in Arlington at the end of August for a cat show (TICA's "annual" - the biggest event on their calendar):</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fticamembers.org%2Fcalendar%2F080830a.htm%3A_fqNz-6914COb49YdXMunSzmCkU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://ticamembers.org/calendar/080830a.htm">http://ticamembers.org/cale...</a></p><p>Mostly Texas is too hot and humid for my taste (especially Houston!).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The training center for where I work is located in San Antonio so I've been there quite a few times over the past decade.  There have been a few comments about the Riverwalk so let me share some useless trivia with those who haven't been.  There are many restaurants along the river that have outdoor seating .  The city drains the river annually (I think) to clean the bottom.  Guess what the most commonly recovered item is during that time?  Forks! [you may now return to your regularly scheduled nap]</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, so the place where I had the _amazing_ lunch in Austin was (according to PayPal): CANTINA LAREDO. I can't recommend this place enough. Fresh guacamole prepared at the table. Even the chips tasted better than normal. And my pork shanks were incredible.</p></div>
