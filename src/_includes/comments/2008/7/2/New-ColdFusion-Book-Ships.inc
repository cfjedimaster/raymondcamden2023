		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, you can request a copy for review. Link is right on the page. I don't feel guilty after all the time it takes to write a book. Rob Brooks chatted with me about this... the very day the book was completely written. (Couldn't he have contacted me sooner! LOL)</p><p>@Don, my goal was to provide something different. (Not totally of course, it is on ColdFusion 8!) I cover the topic an a broad spectrum getting the core concepts down fast. Then the book moves to a number of topics that are more networking based. (This means showing you how to connect to Flickr, Google Maps, Google Searches and more.) It also has chapters on AJAX in CF8, reporting, presentation and more. Another of my goals was to provide a bootcamp book. Not everything you ever wanted to know... but rather lots of stuff as you will appreciate knowing in as little space as possible.</p></div>
