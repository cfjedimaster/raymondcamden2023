		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've walked out of a few movies in my time. The first one was Beverly Hills Cop 3... I made it most of the way through, but reached my limit. The second was Junior, which I only endured for around 20 minutes. The third was due to projection problems, and I don't even remember the specific film.</p><p>I *wanted* to walk out of either Delta Force II or Missing in Action III (can't remember), which my friend the Chuck Norris fan just *had* to see. I counted a lot of ceiling tiles in the theater that night.</p><p>One movie I wanted to walk out on but happily didn't was Van Damme's Cyborg... which was so marvelously awful that my life would be slightly worse for having missed it. I hadn't seen MST3K at that point, but we basically sat there in an almost empty theater and gave it the Crow &amp; Servo treatment. We subsequently spent the rest of the year pausing dramatically in the middle of sentences to intone, "You know, I think *he's* the cure."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't see any of the early highlander movies, but I did see Highlander: End Game, which may be one of the worst movies ever made.</p><p>That's no good to hear about Semi-Pro. I certainly was not jazzed about the previews, but would have went to see it since I am such a huge will ferrel fan. Too bad this was no good. I guess I will wait for the movie on tv.</p></div>
