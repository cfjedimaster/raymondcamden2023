		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with you Ray, I did Mardi Gras in New Orleans when I was 20 - it was not a bad option for a broke 20 year old college kid.  At 33 I would not want to repeat that scene.</p><p>Fortunately my wife has family in Lafayette so we spent the weekend there - we both had to head back to the office this week so we missed the Monday night parades and Fat Tuesday, but enjoyed a ball on Friday night in the Cajundome (!) and a fun parade on Saturday.  Definitely a classier affair than what I experienced "last time" and something I hope to repeat annually.</p><p>Also the King Cake tradition was a new one on me.  In case you don't know King Cake is basically a giant donut with some kind of flavoring baked in.  Every family has their personal favorite King Cake bakery, or makes their own at home.  Inside of the King Cake are little miniature plastic babies, if you get the baby you have to buy the next cake .. this is similar to the French tradition of three Kings' day.</p></div>
