		<div class="comment_text"><p>There's an analogy begging to be made here.  This reminds me of a project I was on where we adopted the newest, hippest technology to the total detriment of our final product, which would have been better if we had stuck to simpler principles.  Instead, we had to figure out the new stuff, and didn't have time to focus on the experience.  Seems like this GTAIII sandbox business is something that's still filtering through the game industry... It's a killer, revolutionary concept, but there are right applications of it and wrong applications of it, and it comes down to good decisions about the experience.  RIA, anyone?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, sometimes I worry about posting too many non-tech articles here on my blog, and then a reader comes along and brings it _back_ to being on topic. Thanks. ;)</p><p>Seriously though - I agree with you completely. "Sandbox" is nice - but I don't think it's always applicable or a good idea for a game.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I totally agree. I hate having to drive back to the start point of races, I get the whole sandbox thing but the nice thing about burnout ancestors was the ease of getting to do what you want to do quickly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love the whole Burnout series and Paradise is great! But I have to agree - driving back to the race start is pain. The map component it definitely taken from NFS carbon but unfortunatelly someone forgot about 'Move me there' option and 'Show GPS' option...<br>Anyway - even with lack of these options Burnout Paradise is great game... and one from EA for PS3 which doesn't hang :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I do find the "No Restart" option annoying as well, I generally just find another race near where I screwed up the last one and do that instead of going back and doing that one particular race...The bigger pain is switching cars, there are not enough Junk Yards around for my taste.  Even with these drawbacks it is a great game and I can't wait for the new content they are supposed to be adding :)</p><p>PS. Online play is really fun if you get a group of guys together who like to do challenges...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, if you love racers you really need to get Wipeout Pulse for PSP. The first Wipeout PSP game was a release title and it too was amazing. A headliner for the system. I'm not sure if you have tried them out but I highly recommend both.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I agree wholeheartedly. The DS does spoil you quite a bit since the load is instant. On the DS I'm looking forward to Racing Gears 2. The original was a GBA game. An awesome racer with that old school birds-eye view. Highly recommended too!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know what's funny - my youngest son has an old Gameboy game - Hotwheels something or another. It has 2 games bundled. It's WAY old. But it's fun as heck. The 3d graphics reminds me of the old Atari arcade game that had true 3d graphics. Back in the day it was THE hottest arcade driver.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unless I'm absolutely certain that I'm going to buy a game, I just rent it through GameFly first.  Then, if I decide I want to keep it, I hang on to it for awhile until the price drops to an acceptable level, then click the "Keep It" button.  Cuts down on buyer's remorse and lets us try out a variety of games across the different platforms we have in the house (360, PS3, Wii, Xbox, PS2, Gamecube, DS, and GBA)</p><p>As for Paradise, I concur with Ray's comments.  I've lost quite a few races near the end due to a wrong turn.  Not having a restart option is a big oversight.  NFSU also made you drive to a garage to switch cars, but they were confined to a smaller area in that game, and, thus, easier/quicker to get to.  I would've also preferred to be able to set nav points on the map; every other decent racer has had those for years.</p></div>
