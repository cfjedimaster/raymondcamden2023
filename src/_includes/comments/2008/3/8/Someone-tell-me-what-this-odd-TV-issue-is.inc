		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's definitely not the tv - it was just the channel, and just for about 3 shows. What I'm thinking is that the secondary audio (for the visual impaired) was being displayed over the main audio. They certainly had audio issues (the earlier show had no primary audio).</p><p>Either way - it was interesting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Try changing the options on your home theatre tuner (if you have one) to dolby digital, or dolby enhanced.  This happens to me when I have the sound options on the tuner set to 2 channel, the center channel which is where the voices come from is effectively turned off.  The wierd thing is that only certain channels are affected.</p></div>
