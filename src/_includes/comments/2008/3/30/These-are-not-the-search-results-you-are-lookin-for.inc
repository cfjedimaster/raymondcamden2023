		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's highly unlikely this is spam.</p><p>It's more likely that someone who was very bad at SEM used the keyword "Date" or "Dating Functions" in their list of searchable keywords. They also likely used the Match function for the Ad Title, resulting in your query becoming the Title.</p><p>These things are rarely discovered until companies feel as though they're getting scammed by google, yahoo, or M$, and either shut-off their campaigns or hire someone with enough experience to address the issue.</p><p>These types of oversights quickly get expensive, though, and clicking the ad is a fast way to help them notice the error (hopefully).</p></div>
