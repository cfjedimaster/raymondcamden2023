		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome!  That Nike dealie looks very cool, and I wonder how it will react if I workout to Dance Dance Revolution while its tracking?</p><p>Hey Ray, any chance you can send the CFWACK to the 2nd place winner?  Just a few weeks ago I got work to shell out for a copy.  Contests like this are a great motivator to me, so thanks to everyone who kept participating.  I bet we all feel better!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Woah... i got 2nd?  Cool!</p><p>Thanks Chris!</p><p>This was a great motivator and it has really improved my diet.  I hurt my ankle middle of the 10 weeks and it took me off the treadmill, but i was able to keep my diet in check and still loose pounds.  I did hit my target weight of 185lbs and that is what me and my doctor wanted to see.</p><p>Of course this week i was at a conference in West Palm Springs FL and gained 4 lbs that i need to loose this weekend and avoid the Easter candy.  :)</p><p>Thanks Ray!</p></div>
