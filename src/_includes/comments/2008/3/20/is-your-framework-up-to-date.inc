		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I'm hearing lots about portals and portlets. I've even read about CF portlets....</p><p>can you explain what makes a portlet and portlet or a portal a portal ? I mean I read on IBM's site all about how it really advances the SOA concept and as I read the descriptions, I think to myself I can do all that in Flex, especially with the new Module component.</p><p>And maybe you can connect all this to the new CF portlet toolikit?</p></div>
