		<div class="comment_text"><p>Eclipse has one kinda silly thing. It demands that all files you work with are in projects. WHile on one hand that is nice for keeping things organized, on the other hand it's a pain for quick edits of files that you may just have temporarily.</p><p>If you get the CF plugins for Eclipse (not CFEclipse, the Adobe ones), you can use RDS, and, actually, CFEClipse has file view. Both of those let you open ad hoc files. But I find it quicker to just double click on a file an open it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey you can't learn everything Ray.. :)</p><p>Totally agree on CS and Transfer though.. I made the big jump from my own procedural framework to OO, Model-Glue, Coldspring and Transfer for a huge project I'm working on and while it's been quite a learning curve I really love how they all work together so well.</p><p>Transfer really is total genius. On this project I haven't written a line of SQL yet.. I also like how it make's you think in terms of the domain model, with the database structure really being the last thing you think about when figuring out the best way to persist the model.<br>It's openend up whole new ways of working for me such as creating a Transfer object in memory and adding data to it over various pages of a user process (adding a question to a site for instance). When finished I simply call the save method and commit it to the database. The great thing about this methodology is it's easy to build the interface to handle both creation of data and then subsequent editing with ease. Really cool.</p><p>I've only known Coldspring so never had the pain of manually instantiating tons of CFC's and managing dependencies. I'm finding it truly awesome. I love that site configurations have a 'place' and are easily modified and injected into the objects that need them..</p><p>I do like the direction the CF community is moving in...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Transfer is great, glad you're liking it!</p><p>And ColdSpring is the one indispensable framework for working with ColdFusion. Doesn't matter if you use Fusebox, or Model-Glue, or Mach-II, or ColdBox, or roll your own. Doesn't matter if you use Transfer or Reactor. Doesn't matter whether it's an HTML app, or an AJAX app, or a Flex app. Doesn't matter if the requests are for HTML, or Flash remoting, or web services. ColdSpring is THE must-have item in all of these stacks. I couldn't imagine working without it at this point.</p></div>

Word wrapping, check.</p><p>So how you described Ctrl + Tab working is actually how I EXPECTED it to work in CFEclipse (same way it works in most tabbed apps), but for some reason it's not (for me). Even after I release both Ctrl + Tab (in either order) the pop up list of open documents remains onscreen until I interact with it. I'm assuming I must have some kind of custom shortcut mapping conflict that's pre-empting the release trigger. I'll pour over the 800 shortcut list and see if I can find a culprit.</p><p>I've used comment background coloring for years now and already miss it in Eclipse. Not that I'm moving to Eclipse, so much as giving it a college try. But I miss it. I look at code, even after I've customized its coloring, and it just looks naked without standout, attractive, easy-to-read comments.</p><p>You seem pretty spry with Eclipse. Do you happen to know a quick and clean way to export all of my settings from one computer to another?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Speaking of Dependency Injection, has anyone tried LightWire? When I was digging around and trying to learn ColdSpring, I happen to run across LightWire. I looked at the API and it was very simple to get things going. ColdSpring was too bulky for me, I wanted something light weight and easier to use. I believe Peter Bell is working on a newer version, here's the link to his site to read more on it: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbell.com%2Findex.cfm%2FLightWire%3AMM8cZDskOrTTk90alqBq1HvrPyI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/LightWire">http://www.pbell.com/index....</a></p><p>Give it a try, it's much easier to use and very light weight.</p><p>I can't wait to take a second look at transfer, to be honest, the presos I watched didn't show enough code, which is a downside to most presos unfortunately. But it sounds like i need to give it a second go and see what all the hype is about.</p><p>Thanks Ray!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Hatem</p><p>I'm using LightWire, when choosing a dependency injection framework I picked it over ColdSpring. The fact that it supports programatic configuration file (as opposed to XML) and allows mixins were key selling points. For example, I love being able to just loop through my services directory and inject a bunch of services into each other with minimal typing or the need for a generator. And with mixins I don't need to add declarations inside the components. In some cases I like having declarations, but for some services that are really needed everywhere, it's nice to be able to skip the declarations. Since I didn't intend to use AOP, Lightwire was perfect for me. If I recall correctly, Peter intended to add AOP eventually, just not sure if he's had any time to work on it lately. So in short, LightWire rules!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My reaction is same as Daniel with regards to using ORM. If you are good in using SQL (Stored Procedures, UDF's), best to stick on using it than relying on ORM's. It also slows down the application performance. But ColdSpring is just  indispensable framework as Brian suggested. It is inevitable in all our model-glue applications.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Shimju</p><p>"It also slows down the application performance." Not necessarily. For example, Transfer has a caching layer that could end up helping you improve the performance. I guess it's like anything else, you evaluate on a case-by-case basis and go from there. Some projects don't warrant an ORM, for others it might be quite appropriate.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think performance is relative in the context of Transfer though. It has very sophisticated caching built in which should improve performance in many applications. When coding up SQL manually I think it's easier to forget about caching or it being a lot more effort to build in. With Transfer you get it out of the box.</p><p>As with everything out there 'it depends' on whether it's the right choice to use an ORM. It's all about how much time you have to do a project and what you want to spend most of your time focusing on.</p><p>For me Transfer is a godsend, especially now that I am working in an OO way. The way it removes the focus from data  to domain model is awesome and really helps speed up development.. It really is nice not to have to think about SQL for most of the application as well..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>a kinda feeling of loosing command in our own codes when using ORM's :). It also creates a kind of in-completeness even after a project is complete. Also you cant able to use Stored Procedure, Views, UDF's if you are using ORM's.</p><p> Also couple of years before many folks proposed Reactor ORM and now Reactor is less spoken and everybody is proposing Transfer ORM. SO those developers who used Reactor earlier may  now migrating to Transfer now:) Iam bit scared of this situation.</p><p>@James Allen, I dont think ORM is needed if you are building a CF application in OO way.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Shimju: Well, I don't think its fair to say that since _one_ ORM failed, that it's not a good idea in general. Sometimes projects come and go - it's natural.</p><p>As for stored procs - using Transfer certainly doesn't mean you have to use it for 100% of your queries.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - Hey!  I take exception to the notion that Reactor has failed.  It's still being used actively in plenty of new projects.  It's development isn't particularly active, but that's because it's pretty stable.  Heck, I'm even talking about performance techniques at CF.Objective().</p><p>(Ok, the docs are miserable. I admit that.)</p></div>
