		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finally got a chance to watch this preso last night - it was terrific! SOOOOOOO impressed by the new returnformat=json (or xml) for the cfc in CF8 ... WOW - that just makes life so much easier doesn't it.</p><p>Also liked the spry sort and spry pagination  - I added those to a project today as a result of your demo.</p><p>It was a shame the Spry guy in the audience didn't have a microphone ... sounded like he had a lot to say.</p><p>I definitely learned a few things there - Cheers Ray!!</p></div>
