		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray basically blogged everything we know.  I'm actually surprised he was able to get it all.  The keynote was aborted and we don't know any more than that.  I found it kind of ironic, since a more full disclosure might not happen until after Open BlueDragon releases its beta tomorrow night.</p></div>
