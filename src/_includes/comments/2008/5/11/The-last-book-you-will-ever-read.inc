		<div class="comment_text"><p>If one of my options during my last hours of life was to finish a book I was in the middle of, I probably wouldn't finish it.  I feel an unpleasant twinge of finality whenever I finish a good book because it's over and done with:  no more possibilities with that story.  I don't need to feel that sort of feeling with my own story coming to an end.</p><p>Another developer at cf.Objective() was telling a small group of us about "A Game of Thrones" as part of a general discussion about sci-fi and fantasy books.  With such similar tastes in the community, maybe we should start a CF developer book club?  :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>seeing how when you die and if you go to heaven, you won't have eyes, it might be hard to read. So getting, theological and doctinal, from a historically christian perspective, I think you would have to wait to the last judgment and  resurrection of the dead where you will be reunited with your body before you could continue reading.</p><p>so yeah, you could finish your book but you might have to wait 100,000 years...</p><p>by the way, this a absolutely fantastic question, being a big reader myself.

I do think that if I'm on my death bed I probably will be more concerned with other things.... but it is kind of fun/interesting to think about, eh? ;)</p><p>@Hakki - If Heaven is "you can do the things you enjoy most", then it does make it a moot question. You would just get the book. I've also thought to myself - if I have all knowledge in Heaven, I'd have to ensure I _didn't_ know how a book ended. ;)</p><p>@Brian - if you are going to cfunited08, there will be a "SciFi" BOF.

I'd like to think once you do pass away you know what the secret to life and everything else is because you become one with everything.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray . . . not all romances are trash.  Trust me on this. ;-)  Some romance novels have really good plot developments with engaging characters.  I've read enough romance books that I know within first few page whether it's going to be junk or a keeper.  It might interest you to know that 22% of of people who read romance novels are men.  What also helps is that there's a monthly magazine - Romantic Times Magazine.  Upcoming books are reviewed.  Also, there are reviews of mystery and sci-fi books.  Don't be embarrassed about picking it up at the bookstore - it's well worth the $ if you hate buying a book only to find it's sheer, utter crap.</p><p>I would recommend Robin D. Owens for the Heart Mate novels.  This is of the sci-fi/fantasy romance genre.  The premise is that a bunch of people with extrasensory talents left Earth because people feared their talents and settled on a planet that enhances their flairs.  But life is hard because there's something about the planet that inhibits some people's ability to reproduce or something like that.  Large families are valued.  She explores literary devices such as alienation, duty, etc. She has excerpts at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frobindowens.com%2Fhome.htm%3A37RtJD-8fIAo3ryFFZzYiM8MMaY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://robindowens.com/home.htm">http://robindowens.com/home...</a></p><p>Give it a try and see how you like it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - I kind of like the theory that Adama had in a recent ep of Galactica, when he explained to Roslin that he had never finished his favorite book, because he enjoyed the experience of reading it so much that he couldn't bear to let it go. I think that ultimately, that is the sign of a truly great book. Good books are the ones you enjoy reading but are ready to move on to something else when you finish; great books are the ones you don't ever want to end.<br>I've experienced the whole "author dies early" thing myself, but since I knew that the author (C.S. Forester) was dead before I ever started reading the series (Hornblower), I guess I didn't have *too* much cause to be disappointed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Going back to your original request for recommendations, since part of the discussion is about heaven itself and what it may or may not be like, I'd recommend a book called, simply enough, "Heaven", by Randy Alcorn. It's available both as a book and in audio, as well as a study guide (for groups), and finally an abbreviated form that could be read in just an hour.</p><p>Great especially for one who knows the end is imminent, as you asked, but also for those who have the conception you described, Ray. :-) It's NOT going to be about babies with harps floating in the clouds, nor even a monotonously deadly eternity of "worship", at least not according to the bible, on which he bases all of his observations.</p><p>Now, those who don't care what the bible has to say will of course have their own conception of heaven, and I'm not picking any fight with them here. But they may still get great value out of the book, and it's my sincere hope that they would.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love to read: newspapers, blogs, and especially books.  I've definitely been guilty of reading a good novel through dinner and until 4-5am.  But I can promise you: when death comes, I will not be regretting that I didn't finish some book.</p><p>I can't help but be reminded of this quote: "We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First of all the last book I would read would probably end up being some part of the latest and greatest CFWACK because I'd probably be trying to figure out how to do something and then I'd just croak all of a sudden at my desk, you know then I'd probably have some sort of post mortem drool on the laptop until it sparks and incinerates me like Darth Vader.  Then I'd look like that poor guy that the people inside of "The Cube" found who had been unfortunate enough to trip one of those "say hello to Hoffa for me" booby traps that engulfs people in flames.</p><p>Second of all, and on a much more positive note, after the health gains you made from the CF Biggest Loser contest you should not worry about dying anytime soon.

I didn't read all the comments and i'm not sure if anyone else recommended this, but IMO, I think you should pick up the Quran and read it, that goes for anyone else reading this blog as well. Rather than reading ordinary peoples words and stories, read the word of God, but that's just my opinion!</p><p>Great post btw, reading is fundamental!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, i just went back and read the article and the comments again and would like to share my belief on heaven. We are all on an eternal journey that will end up in one of two places, eternity in heaven or eternity in the hell fire. One of the most important things that we should all do, and i'm guilty of this as well, is detach ourselves from this world and worldly things and start to live like Sean said as if today was our last day.</p><p>When you sit down and give it some thought, you may have some money saved up, a house, a nice car, etc... but what does that mean? Those "things" will not go with you, sure, you could leave them behind to loved ones, but is that all what we are meant for??? What good deeds have you accumulated to present to your maker? How much of your time did you devote to God? When is the last time you fed a homeless person or helped someone (not with code or development)? There are more important things that we have to accomplish in this life. I'm sure many of the readers have different belief systems, and many of you will follow what makes sense to you. The Quran is the word of God verbatim, not like the other good books that are the "word of man inspired by God". I'm not trying to start a religious debate or a flame war, just stating my opinion.</p><p>Don't spend your time and waste your life on things that have no significance, spend it on things that count. Every good deed you do, God gives you 10 times its worth. You go invest $10,000 in the bank, will they give you a $100,000 for it, probably not. Start working on accumulating good deeds and believe in the oneness of God and that he has no partners, children, relatives, etc... You will find peace and happiness in your hearts and lives.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Hakki - You are quite welcome, I'm glad you appreciated my comment!</p><p>I still think we should learn, read, and accumulate wealth, but we should try to keep from getting tunnel vision. If you emphasize too much focus on making money, you will lose focus else where which could be a downside in some ways. Speaking from my own personal experience, being that I am Muslim, we have 5 obligatory prayers to make daily. I used to schedule my prayers around everything else in my life rather than scheduling my life around my prayers which have defined times of the day that they have to be performed. I have found so much inner peace since changing my methodology and I feel very comfortable with the way things are now.</p><p>No one is perfect, but we should try to be as good as possible, there is no guarrantee as to how long we will live on this earth.</p><p>Thanks again!</p></div>

It has a faithtype attribute that supports Protestant, Muslim, Catholic, Jewish and even .NET parameters (.NET is for those who have little faith).  With this tag when you're apps crash they dont' pass go or collect 200 dollars - they immediately go to that big JVM garbage collector in the sky. The next release will have support for the Amish with a Menenite modifier (since the Amish can't use computers themselves it would be very difficult for them to invoke the tag without help from the Menenites).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are some comments regarding the Koran and Islam that I would like to address (Leviticus 5:1, 2 Cor 10:5). Here are some facts, supported by the Koran and the Bible.</p><p>If the Koran were Word of God as is claimed, it would not contradict itself (for example, Allah created everything "in the twinkling of an eye" (54:49,50), "in two Days" (41:9,12), "in four Days" (41:10), "in six Days" (7:54, 10:4;32:4), "a Day," equaling "a thousand years" (32:5) and also "fifty thousand years" (70:4); Jesus is not the Son of God (4:171), yet He is (19:17-21), etc.), nor would there be any errors in it. (Arabian legends are recounted as actual happenings. The Koran contains much superstition and occultism, especially its references to genies.), nor would Allah need to change his mind (Allah says, "Such of our revelations as we abrogate or cause to be forgotten, we bring (in place) one better or the like" (Surah 2:106) and “We put one revelation in place of another...” (16:101))</p><p>If Islam were a religion of peace, then the Koran wouldn't refer to the Jews as "apes" (Surah 2:65) and "pigs." The Koran says in Surah 5:33 (see also 47:4) that all those who oppose Allah (i.e., non-Muslims) are to be "killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off...." Surah 9:5 says to "slay the [non-Muslims] wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush...." Islam's earnest goal, set forth in the Koran and hadith (Islamic written tradition), remains the same: to bring all mankind into submission (that's what "Islam" means) and to kill or enslave all "infidels" (i.e., unbelievers in Allah and Muhammad his prophet—Surah 2:190-92;4:76;5:33;9:5,29,41;47:4, etc.). We all know Islam is the driving force behind terrorism today. Muhammad declared, "The last hour will not come before the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them."</p><p>Allah also tells Muslims, "Take not the Jews and Christians for friends...slay the idolaters [infidels] wherever ye find them. ...Fight against those who...believe not in Allah nor the Last Day" (5:51;9:5,29,41). In fact, Muhammad, whose word cannot be changed, imposed upon every Muslim in every age the duty of exterminating all Jews. Only then can the "Last Day" (the climax of Islam) arrive.</p><p>In contrast, the God of the Bible is a God of love who wants men to know Him (Jer 9:24), a knowledge essential to salvation (Jn 17:3). Jews are His "chosen people" (Ex 6:7; Lv 20:26; 1 Chr 16:13; Ps 105:6, etc.) and Christians are His dearly loved children (Rom 8:16,21; Gal 3:26; Eph 1:5;5). The Bible comes to us from about 40 men over the course of 1,600 years, most of whom never met. Their commonality was the claim of being inspired by Yahweh, the one true God of “Abraham...of Isaac...and of Jacob” (Ex 3:15, etc.). Their writings are harmoniously integrated with intricate themes developed from one to another in a manner that proves divine inspiration. One theme running throughout from Genesis to Revelation is the crimson thread of God's plan of salvation. This is carefully unfolded in deepening revelation from writer to writer—and supported by hundreds of prophecies that have been fulfilled without change or failure.</p><p>God has left no doubt that He himself has come to earth through the virgin birth to pay the infinite penalty His own justice demands for sin, providing a just and eternal salvation. Salvation for sinful man was part of God's plan from all eternity.</p><p>If there is any book one should read prior to death, it is the Bible. "I am the Lord, I change not....For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven" (Mal 3:6; Ps 119:89).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Helzown, first of all, it's a real shame that you would come in here and attack someone elses belief and try to mislead the readers at the same time with your 2 and 3 word excerpts from various scriptures in the Quran. If you don't happen to read Arabic and do not understand the language, than it is suggested to find a proper translation and to also read the commentary. The Arabic language is such a beautiful language and is very difficult to translate directly into English or any other language for that matter.</p><p>Apparently you are an ignorant person trying to spread hate, I'm not going to engage any further than this:</p><p>You quoted the Quran, not really, but for arguments sake I'll say you grabbed some words from it. You also quoted the Bible, and tried to show us the greatness of the book. You did not however show us your book, the Torah, because that truly preaches hate.</p><p>I clearly see what you are doing, you're trying to win the readers of the Christian faith over and turn everyone against Islam, but unfortunately for you, you cannot use your own book to quote something good from it.</p><p>BTW, in the Quran the Jews were the chosen people and time and time again God sent messengers to them but they kept on being disobedient. The Quran was sent for all of mankind since the Jews failed over and over again.</p><p>I apologize Ray and readers, I read my comments and did not see anything that incited this discussion, this was courtesy of Helzown, I cannot let him say these lies without a response. Please do not be mislead by him, as you can see he is hateful and can't even quote his own faith because of all the hate it preaches and how it differentiates the Jews from everyone else since in their eyes they are better than everyone else.</p><p>This was a nice discussion up until now, I hope it doesn't continue on the negativity of Helzown and that it ends here. If anyone is interested in the true translation and explanation of the mentioned scriptures, please feel free to ask and we can carry the conversation privately or in a more appropriate location, not a "Coldfusion Coding Site".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm also going to pitch in here and criticize Helzown - the "quotes" from the Quran are substantially mistranslated. As Hatem says, if you don't read and understand Arabic, you can't really make sense of the Quran - there are some very misguided translations with serious anti-Islam agendas behind them.</p><p>Furthermore, the Christian Bible is full of contradictions (and some very violent and revenge-driven guidelines). Of course, the Bible is mostly a careful construction from a number of sources and what we are familiar with today is a very selective translation taken from a much larger body of works in a variety of languages.</p><p>The trouble with "book religions" is that you are reliant on someone else's translation...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am a parallel reader, rather than a serial reader. That is, I usually have 3 or 4 books on the go. If I die reading a book, then I will probably have 2 or 3 others half finished. Hmmmmm, maybe I should read one at a time so I can get more books finished.<br>Tom (TRCoach)</p></div>
