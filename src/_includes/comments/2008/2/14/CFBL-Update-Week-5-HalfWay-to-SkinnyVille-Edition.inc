		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, 1% isn't so bad. In 10 weeks that would be 10% of your weight, which is pretty darn good. I want to go from 230 to 210. That's 20 pounds. 10% of 230 is 23, so I won't be even losing 10%.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know my main problem is that I haven't been able to exercise as much as I'd like.  Mostly I'm just trying to eat healthy and take the dog and baby for a walk to keep in shape.  Right now I've pretty much stalled.  I got good weight loss to begin with but now I'm back to my standard 235 (I was this weight for quite a while after college and couldn't lose anything even when I was exercising regularly...weird).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can say that I definitely was stalled until I cranked up both the diet and the exercise. I didn't double it... just cranked it up. You may want to try that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Keep up the good work...</p><p>You Can Do IT!</p><p>Baby steps... Don't try to do too much at once, fat loss (not weight loss because its not a true measure) is a long term investment that requires not only changes in eating habits but lifestyle changes (stairs vs escalator/elevator, biking to the corner store instead of taking the car etc).  But if you take it slow it will take root and grow :)</p></div>
