		<div class="comment_text"><p>Spot on!</p><p>Another reason why I subscribe to your blog Ray. I'm currently building a web 2.0 site which makes extensive use of cfajaxproxy and the other CF8 Ajax tags. I had completely missed the verifyClient functionality when using the documentation. I recognised early on that Ajax functionality suddenly opens the site to lots of different exploits - scraping, brute force hacking etc. I was going to implement my own verification system but wasn't quite sure what approach to take.</p><p>This inbuilt functionality is great. Another reason why CF8 is the complete package..</p><p>Thanks for blogging about this Ray and writing the security article.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, good stuff. I definitely had never even heard of VerifyClient() before. The JSON prefix thing sounds familiar, but that entire article was basically news to me :)</p></div>
