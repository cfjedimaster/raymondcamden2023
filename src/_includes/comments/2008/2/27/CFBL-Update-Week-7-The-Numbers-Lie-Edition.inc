I started "super hydration".  I drink about a gallon of cold water a day and the first day i did it i gained 4 lbs and was going to the bathroom every hour!  A few days later i lost the 4 plus 2 more.  I still go to the bathroom a lot.</p><p>They say you burn 150calories just to process the cold water.  The water makes you feel full and keeps the liver efficient to convert fat to energy.</p><p>I did read somewhere that some doctors think too much water can damage the stomach lining, but they did not way what "too much" was.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was doing a LOT of water early on, and when I slowed down, it did seem to slow my weight loss as well. I need to get back at it. Plus - I tend to get headaches when I don't have enough water.</p></div>

I think the recommended amount of water is 8 cups a day, you are only at 16 cups.</p><p>NOTE: This is not medical advice.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have been drinking a lot more water as well, probably a bout a gallon, but spaced throughout the day.  When I start to feel a little hungry, I drink some water and it goes away for a bit.</p><p>I used to drink about a gallon of Crystal Light De-caf Iced tea a day. II can say i have gone 2 weeks without 1 single glass. I have also tried to cut down on diet soda as well. Probably not helping with the weight loss, but at least I am not taking in all those artificial sweeteners.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The issue that I have with drinking so much water throughout the day, is that I am using the bathroom literally every 20 minutes. Kind of embarrassing in a work environment.</p></div>
