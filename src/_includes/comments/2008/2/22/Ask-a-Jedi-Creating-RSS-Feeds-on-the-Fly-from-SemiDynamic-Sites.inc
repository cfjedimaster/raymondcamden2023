		<div class="comment_text"><p>You could create an aggregator feed that would read and filter the Contributor feed(s). If a Contributor feed contained a certain keyword or token designating "publish this update," then the aggregator feed would include the feed and disregard all the others (because they're typos or intermediate edits).</p><p>The feed service description says, "this service is in the form of a starter ColdFusion script, and can be extended to fit specific needs," so it sounds like you may be able to modify the original feed script to look for a "publish" token and not need an aggregator feed. You might have your colleague send you the "starter ColdFusion script" for the Contributor feed to see.</p></div>
