		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice post Ray (yet another that seems highly relevant to my current thinking - your Facebook one comes at the *perfect* time).</p><p>I keep hearing lots of CF guys talking about Flex so it does seem to be something many developers are getting behind. I just haven't got my head around how it works yet, but it's good to not have to think about the CF immediately.</p><p>I think my initial thoughts were it would be like developing a flash application, but I assuming now it's more like a development bridge to a Flash movie which takes care of generating all the graphical 'stuff'.</p><p>One of the things to put on the 'To Learn' list me thinks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Plus, seeing as how CF is really just a means to access a dB backend (unless you're using AIR, which you may have a local SQLite dB and probably won't need CF at all), there really isn't a whole lot of reason to start trying to learn the CF interaction at the beginning.  I worked through the book, Adobe Flex 2: Training from the Source by Jeff Tapper.  Lots of really useful information in it, and doesn't go too in depth.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would recommend taking a class, Mike Kollen offers some good courses through UCI, they are online, recorded if you miss a class, he has all sorts of examples and he is a Adobe Certified Instructor.  He teaches a lot of Boeing employees, the only draw back is that the courses tend to be a little slow for me.  I tend to learn more just by reading the documentation and reading blogs from the Adobe Evangels/Community.  His courses are a great way to get started though in my opinion.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmikekollen.com%2Fblog%2F%3AVNXEyBhGUEagJ5MUVrCTumtUcQQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mikekollen.com/blog/">http://mikekollen.com/blog/</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agre with Gareth. When I first started using Flex I was asked to convert some of my existing CF apps into Flex ones. Jeff Tappers book was really helpful. I must admit though, I have found that the best way for me to learn is buying working through some examples from books, then trying to build something myself.</p></div>
