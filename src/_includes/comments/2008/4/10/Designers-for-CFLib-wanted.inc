		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd like keyword, function, category and tag-based searching/browsing... perhaps a page listing all the authors with their submissions listed below (or link to a search). Google is a great way to monetize the site search, but I rarely find what I'm looking for and have to resort to browsing, reading the descriptions and viewing the source code.</p><p>I just noticed the "Advance search" link.  It's better, but could still be improved... I almost missed the "next/previous" links at the top as I expected them to be at the bottom like Google and other search sites.</p><p>BTW: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2Fwww.CFQuickDocs.org%2F%3ACrI2L4hWFbH9BCOiEzfSdv2NA6U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http:/www.CFQuickDocs.org/">http:/www.CFQuickDocs.org/</a> doesn't seem to be working.  I checked <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FDNSStuff.com%3AnUACt7adKxKq7GR5weAF-VshAh4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="DNSStuff.com">DNSStuff.com</a> and they report "The parent servers say that the domain <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfquickdocs.org%3Af3q8f-2sXkT4oCCnGq3aAt0neSs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cfquickdocs.org">cfquickdocs.org</a> does not exist."</p><p>Whatever you do, please minimize the amount of ajax/flash.  I prefer to bookmark search results pages and I can't do that on Riaforge due to the ajax-populated results.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Sami: This is just something we may have to disagree with. I wanted the code at CFLib to be best practice (as much as possible) and focused so that we have one main UDF per feature. Now I do have some UDFs that duplicate each other. But in general, the idea was to use one UDF for each bit of functionality.</p><p>This I think sets CFLib apart from places like the Adobe Exchange where you may find 100 solutions to one problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Riaforge doesn't have enough categories to make it easy enough to browse or search through. CFLib works well with its own dedicated site, and many libs are just short and sweet snippets, so it's a bit over the top to put each lib onto Riaforge, in my humble opinion.</p><p>The nice thing about <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fregexlib.com%3Ao7JwiGuU4eQ5plYx-cmLwyS3AkE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="regexlib.com">regexlib.com</a> is that users can comment and point out shortcommings of code, suggest improvements and post modifications. And because you can discuss it you may learn new things that you didn't expect to and you end up with an even better function than the original one that was posted.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray: CFLib should stay its own site as oversight is practical and purposeful. Unlike RIAForge where one would go to look an application and sample code, on CFLib one would look for one or more functions to incorporate into a project. The oversite is good so a programmer will have some faith that the code has been reviewed and will play well with other code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just to add to Ray's comments on the code quality on CFLib...</p><p>One of the other factors that went into the decision to approve all UDFs is that we actually spent a lot of time cleaning up code before making it live.  You wouldn't believe (especially in the early days) the number of submissions that came in without variables var'd.  We also used to look for inefficiencies in the way that various functions were written and cleaned them up before making them live.  This always involved a back and forth with the original author.  We weren't always right, but overall I really do believe it contributed to the quality of the site and the code hosted on it.</p><p>Oh, and I'd like to see CFLib remain separate from RIAforge too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's not bad. Structure wise though - it looks the same as before. I'm planning on dropping pages like Tools, Resources, and About, shoot even RSS will be dropped since you can use the auto-discovery thing in HTML.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>oh wait, I just realized that you are not talking about killing off RSS.  You only want to remove the obvious link in the top navigation that really doesn't link to a "read" webpage.  This is a good idea.  If you want to promote it visually, you could use the orange RSS icon and include it in the footer of your page.  We always add a page to instruct new users as to what RSS is and recommend a couple of programs to digest the feed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Guys, I've narrowed it down to two designs. First is Joel's:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsingularityconcepts.com%2Fcflib.html%3AYbz8TbKJpxwYILYQrOm1QO9Q654&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://singularityconcepts.com/cflib.html">http://singularityconcepts....</a></p><p>This has a unique color scheme and seems the closest to cfquickdocs.</p><p>Then there is design two: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coldfusionjedi.com%2Fdownloads%2Fdetail_newfonts_gravatar.jpg%3ALYbHvKbQwmr6I0b-7EZBsVK86uw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/downloads/detail_newfonts_gravatar.jpg">http://www.coldfusionjedi.c...</a></p><p>This is by Justin Johnson of E-Dreamz <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edreamz.com%3Aj_A1AtxMkgIrxoy0TASBPbj4iK8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.edreamz.com">www.edreamz.com</a>. His design isn't a single page like cfquickdocs, but I really dig it. FYI, the pictures next to each UDF represent gravatars, which I think is a cool idea and kind of gives credit to UDF authors.</p></div>
