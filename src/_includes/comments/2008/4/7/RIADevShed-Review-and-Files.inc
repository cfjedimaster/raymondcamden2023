		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray!  You mean to say we weren't able to connect you with any good beer while you were in the Beehive State?  That's a shame, because there really truly is some.  I had toddler duties to perform, or I would have seen to it myself.  Thanks for the Spry session, by the way.  It was good stuff.</p></div>

It seemed like more than that.</p><p>Possibly because I was so sloshed I was seeing double, I had some REALLY strong chocolate milk on the way to the conference.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh geez - we go through all that work to make sure our guests are taken care of and then the gate people go and screw it up. Its for this very reason that next year we'll be extending personal teleportation devices to our speakers - the joy of airline travel is dead. Bring on molecular parsing!</p><p>Finally tally we had around 65 (can't pin point an exact number given those that were there for just a few hours, speakers who were there only a portion of the day, a few sponsor folks who had peeps drift in, etc.).</p></div>
