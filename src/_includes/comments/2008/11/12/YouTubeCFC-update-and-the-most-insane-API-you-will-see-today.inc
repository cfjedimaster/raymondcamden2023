		<div class="comment_text"><p>Makes perfect sense to me.  Their engine doesn't handle agglutinative terms.  They don't want developers glossing over that fact and then submitting a bunch of garbage, so they build it into the API.</p><p>It comes down to accepting a search term like "lich king" and then silently failing and returning no results, or throwing an error.  Since there are actually possible results, returning none is the wrong answer.  An error of "nope, sorry, can't handle that" is the right thing because that is actually the case.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree. Their API could easily do what I did - reformat the text. Think about it - right now they have placed the responsibility on the external site using their API. They have a restriction that is - you have to admit - something that the average user would have a great deal of trouble with. So those of us in the middle have to handle it.</p><p>I see no reason why lich king couldn't simply be turned into lich,king. Technically this is not the same as "lich king", but it gets the job done.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's just great! So "ColdFusion" as a product name works fine because it's one word, but "cold fusion" (as in the energy technology) is right out. For that matter "Transfer ORM" or "Ractor ORM" either... which are a pan to search on google because "transfer" and "reactor" are so common (minus the ORM)... Granted that on Youtube, you're search is likely to produce the Reactor ORM videos with keywords of "Reactor,ORM" and that's probably also true of "cold,fusion" ... still, I'm certain there are legitimate word-pairs that would fail on this design. Blech...</p></div>
