They'll be roving gangs and mass murderers on the loose and most of us will be dead. However, they'll be plenty of alternative energy for the gangs and murders to get around and destroy us.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My brother and I were talking about the "wealth gap" in the US; and he seemed to think that the 'wealth gap' could lead to a revolution.  He referred me to the french revolution as an example.  He also made a comment along the lines that "If they don't have bread, why don't they eat cake?" which I assume related to the rich being out of touch w/ the poor folk.</p><p> Reading the Wikipedia entry on the french revolution, it is not hard to see similarities w/ the US today.  Food Riots and roving gangs seem to be a "Absolute worst case" scenario.  I can't fathom the US society degrading to that in five years without some serious "beyond our control" event ( Nuclear War, Alien invasion, ice caps melting, etc.. )</p><p> I could be in denial.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry for going all historical and standing up for the French Nobility, but that quote is a bad translation from the original "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche". What she was probably trying to say was "as flour is in short supply and therefore expensive why don't they eat brioche instead of bread at the same price" as French law at the time stated that all types of loaf were sold at a fixed price. <br>I hope I haven't just bored everyone!? :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think the armor should be much of an issue as long as the "helmet" protects against critical hits. Now, if that's a two-handed sword ... well, I've always been partial to dual-wielding myself. If you insist on a single sword, at least carry a tower shield or something like that.</p></div>
