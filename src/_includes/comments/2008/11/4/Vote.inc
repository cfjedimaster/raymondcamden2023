		<div class="comment_text"><p>As the US has such a massive impact on the *entire* world (especially since 9/11) I think it's pretty natural for people in other countries to have an opinion on who they would like to see as president.</p><p>We get all the coverage of the policies of both candidates and know as much as people living in the US. We have the right to state our opinions as we will all be affected by whoever get's into power.</p><p>It would be a different matter if the US had no influence on other countries but that is obviously not the case.</p><p>I personally wouldn't care if people in the US stated opinion on who should be the next prime minister over here, but I'm sure most wouldn't have a clue about how our system of government works or even who our prime minister is. That isn't the case with the US elections as we're alot more aware of what is going on.. Surely we have the right to express our opinions based on what we know? Again, this affects us all however indirectly.</p></div>

I think the media is the biggest problem in these things most of the time, although I suppose it's a necessary evil in some ways.</p><p>I personally would support Obama 1000% if he was running for this country. He is certainly someone I can get behind. In some ways he reminds me of Tony Blair when he first ran for prime minister, only even more exciting. Regardless of what happened in later years (Iraq etc), Blair brought in massive positive change for country and helped to repair some of the damage done by the conservatives..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's kind of what I didn't get in your initial statement.<br>"I am realyl getting sick of hearing about who other people in other countries would vote for."</p><p>I didn't understand how that would be of any relevance to you if you're referring to other regular citizens, because why on earth would my opinion have any bearing on your choice anyway. And just because some don't want to hear something shouldn't affect someone elses right to say something about it.</p><p>I realize from the subsequent post that you were mainly referring to the medias coverage of this which sort of changes things, because while we do have opinions on the elections (and I do believe we're entitled to it), we don't have any influence on what the US media want to focus on.</p><p>"One thing I would love to know is, woudl you support the same person to run your country?

Even an american Democrat would be so far to the "right" of our most conservative/liberal party that I don't think many would be voting for any candidate.<br>We're probably pretty much communists the lot of us by american standards :)<br>It's kind of funny, as the tradition is that if a democrat gets elected, our labour/left will be first to congratulate them from the norwegian political scene, and if it's a republican the conservative party will be first. Despite what I said above about democrats being far beyond our most conservative on almost all issues.</p><p>(and in the last paragraph of my previous post I meant opinion, not decision) :)</p></div>

It's not a handout, it's a tax cut.</p><p>One of the best lines from Caddyshack: "Yeah? Well, the world needs ditch diggers too".  Not everyone has the brainpower or the will to "be rich".  The way I see it: taking 5% from someone who makes 10k/year is a heck of a lot different from taking 5% from someone who makes 500k/year.  I'm fine with the person working the fryer at McDonald's getting to keep an extra few bucks if it means I can't pay cash for my new Hummer!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Scott<br>"You make more money, so you owe us a larger percentage"</p><p>That's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is "You've been fortunate, so you should share with people who have been less fortunate." Some people are lazy, true, and it sucks to help people who just want to freeload. But some people work hard and face nearly insurmountable obstacles, and I'm happy, as somebody who's been fortunate, to share a little more of what I get with those around who can use the boost. And bear in mind that I'm from Canada, so it's likely that I pay a lot more tax than you! If you tell me "I base my decision exclusively on what's best for my family and me", then your logic is flawless. But if care a little about some of your other fellow countrymen (which I'd hope you do), it's a little more complicated.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think anyone is disputing the searches per se - but more the methods and the complete lack of information about what is going on during the search. Haven't we all heard stories of folks who have had their laptops taken for _no_ reason, only to get it back months later with no explanation? That happened to someone in our community (but I won't name him in case he wants it kept secret).</p><p>That being said - in Tom's list, that's probably the least worrisome to me. The illegal wiretapping is probably the worst. And of course we have our nice camps where we have thrown terrorist suspects away forever. I'm a huge believer in justice. Saying that "This person is bad, and I don't have proof yet, so I'm just going to keep him locked away until I have proof", is not the America I believe in.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I get real bothered by logic of "We can't say why we are doing X, because if you know we are doing X, blah blah blah." So for example, the whole no fly list. The government won't reveal the list. But - if you are on the list, the only thing that happens is that you can't fly. So if this isn't a list of "If we see you, we arrest you", then what in the heck is the point of keeping it secret.</p><p>This is WAY OT now, but it reminds me of the guy who brought EPA-related charges against Area 51. His client was a man who had gotten some kind of environmental damage while on the base. The lawyer tried to find out what kinds of chemicals he could have been exposed to while on the base, and the military said they couldn't answer that. While that is expected in some cases - like maybe they have super secret jet fuel, they wouldn't even answer questions about paint. Their feeling was that any such answers would lead to a 'collage' of data that the enemy could pierce together.</p><p>To be honest though, the military is NOT, and should NOT, be concerned with freedom. Their job is to defend and attack. The government is charged with directing the military.</p><p>And boy, that's really, really OT. I should just delete it, but screw it, it's my blog. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When it comes to making the US safer, I think it's important to remember what has made it less safe in the first place (like, for example, its foreign policy in the middle east). There are ways to make the US safer that don't fall under defense spending, war, and intelligence gathering. A lot can be done by taking a different posture on the international scene. It's harder now because a lot of damage has been done, but it can be done and it should start now.</p><p>As for some additional security measures, I can't say I'm super bothered. I take off my shoes, go through random checks, turn on my computer without feeling too bothered. As long as the people running security are courteous (and they always have been with me), I have no problem subjecting myself to a little more scrutiny if it's gonna make everybody a little safer in the end. For the pleasure of going to the US, I'd say it's well worth it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To give you an idea of what happened between the primaries and the general election: I've worked the polls in my precinct the last three or four years (we split off from a larger precinct after the '04 general election). Turnout has been poor, even during the primary. We had about 1070 registered voters in May and about 270 voted.</p><p>We are very heavily Republican, and Hamilton County (IN) is heavily Republican. Part of the reason for low turnout in off years is that many local races are uncontested, but part of it is that we have a lot of high-turnover housing in the precinct (apartments and condos).</p><p>Yesterday when we opened, there were 50-60 people waiting in line. There was a 2-hour wait from 6 AM through about 2 PM; it gradually dropped to an hour by 4 PM, and continued to drop until 6 PM, when no one was waiting in line. (Indiana polls are open 6 to 6 local time.)</p><p>We now have around 1200 registered voters and ended up with about 58-60% turnout ... and we were dwarfed by other precincts in the county. When we turned in the results at the judicial center, there were people in other precincts reporting 75-85% turnout.</p><p>I never thought I'd be disappointed with 60%.</p><p>Now if only we can maintain something like this for local elections ... of course we'll have to have contested races for that to be a possibility.</p></div>

I'm very hopeful for Obama can accomplish, but I think some people think he's gonna wave a magic wand and transform things instantaneously. They forget that almost 48 million people did vote for McCain, so it's not like all of a sudden the entire country is behind Obama.
