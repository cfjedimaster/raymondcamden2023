		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to say I was a little disappointed at the ColdFusion coverage in the general sessions. I was amazed that they barely mentioned the CF/Hibernate integration for CF 9, given that it's already been blogged about a little. I mentioned that to Jason Delmore when I attended the ORM session and he said they hadn't planned on talking about it at all and that's why it didn't really make it in. Still a bit disappointing, I think if they had talked about it in the general session the ORM session would have been packed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wonder if the CF9 features were played down so as to make a bigger splash next year, when maybe there won't be Player 10, Flex 4, Builder 4, CS4 etc. etc. etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure it's fair to say it was downplayed. With all the products Adobe has, I think CF got a fair amount of time. I actually expected more CS4 stuff since it was just released.</p></div>
