		<div class="comment_text"><p>At least there's some good for us Europeans now:</p><p>- Flying in and shopping in N.Y. is CHEAP ;-)<br>- US Cars are CHEAP - interiorwise (nothing changed there) and pricetagwise (new!) ;-)</p><p>I'm considering the Coldfusion Camp. It's a 800 km drive but hey, if I wanna meet fellow Euro CF'ers, that's the place to go.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Since the economy has been in the gutter, hedge funds have been dumping gold. This has caused gold to go down quite a bit. In addition, people have been dumping investments (obviously) and hoarding cash.</p><p>So, the currency is the investment choice and the choice right now is the dollar. Now would actually be the best time to go to Europe as the dollar hasn't been this good for two+ years!</p><p>July 7 2008 Dollar = .65 Euro<br>November 3 2008 Dollar = .78 Euro<br>April 24, 2006 Dollr = .79 Euro</p><p>Of course, that's unfortunate because the one part of our economy that was still humming along was the export sector...</p></div>
