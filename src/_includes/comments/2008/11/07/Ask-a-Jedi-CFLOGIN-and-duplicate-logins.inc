		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>What are your thoughts on using cookies for this in combination with the application scope.  So, when a user logs in a session token is served to the user as a cookie.  If that user tries logging into the site from another pc the system could invalidate the session token cookie of the other user and allow the second to log in.  This would be handy so that if a user forgets to log off the session could be terminated anyway.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can't invalidate a cookie like that though. Request A comes from Safari and logs in. You send cookie X to him. Request B comes in from FF. How would you kill the cookie for Safari? Both have the same IP.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good point.  I guess you maybe able to add a column to the users table with the code as well.  So, when Request B comes in, it would see that the cookie is different and change it.  The only issue though is that I would think every users request would have to verify against the database and that might not be a great thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually Ray, there is a way. I just wrote up SessionUtility for RiaForge, and now you can traverse session internals to check to see if a person is already logged and even log the former out if needed. I have the code in prod environment for 3 weeks now, working flawlessly. Hope to have the code up soon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Sami: How is this different from keeping a list of logged in users anyway? I mean I get how it may be simpler to look at the sessions - I get that - but it doesn't seem like it solves the problem of 2 browsers for example.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't have my notes for this in front of me, but I was thinking that you could keep an application scope of the users and the ip addresses.  If someone logs in with the same username you update the ipaddress.  The next time the first user hits a page your script sees the ipaddress is different and logs them out.  This solution wouldn't work for users at the same location / on the same ip, but It would work fine for user sharing via the internet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rays solution works well.<br>I have a similar solution in place for quite some time.<br>I have an App scope array called Application.Sessions<br>and each item is a struct with<br>username<br>IP<br>start_time<br>last_request</p><p>in my OnRequestStart() I check that the user is not already in the Sessions struct and, if they pass validation I add them to it, if they are already there, I simply log them out and back in.<br>This may not work for all because its an internal app that uses Windows login credentials and no login form at all.<br>it checks their browsers client login param and if its there, checks it against the user table. Otherwise its not in the browser so they have not passed windows nt auth.</p><p>But the point remains, keep a record of all valid sessions currently in use, use user authentication of some kind and if they pass that, then validate your in memory sessions. if they are not in it, add them if they are in it, alert them they have been logged out.</p><p>This is also my session tracker in my admin console to monitor system usage. I actually update the Array with CF Event system and use the sample Flex session manager app to monitor real time. I can even kick them out of my app with the Flex monitor as well as send global and user specific messages.</p><p>seems easy to me.</p><p>Tim</p></div>
