		<div class="comment_text"><p>I went to the BOF site, used Charles to get the XML they were using, did a quick find-n-replace in their XML, and dumped the BOF schedule into a HTML table.</p><p>You can see it here:  <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yapiodesign.com%2Ffiles%2FBOF_Schedule.html%3AEGLsbtv6wvi23KffIwG6sMMHLi4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.yapiodesign.com/files/BOF_Schedule.html">http://www.yapiodesign.com/...</a></p><p>Of course, if Adobe changes their schedule, I'll have to re-do it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I had about 3 BOF suggestions from speakers ready to suggest to MAX, then they went in a different direction. Sorry the SciFi BOF didn't make it. At CFUnited, I'll have another one thrown for you, but it will be located in the same hotel/conf center this time and in one of the bars with video games maybe.
