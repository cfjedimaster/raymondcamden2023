		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool.  Nice little article.  You may want to get them to escape the cfqueryparam tags in the example you gave.  The lt gt tags are hiding the tag itself :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't forget the extra functionality of CF that is inherent with the product: dynamic Image manipulation, automatic PDF and Flash Paper generation, CFC documentation capabilities (show me where PHP documents anything), better server/file manipulation capabilities just to name a few.</p><p>Oh, and the biggest one I can think of: &lt;strong&gt;LEGACY SUPPORT&lt;/strong&gt;. I cannot tell you the number of times a HHWD production PHP site went down due to a hosting company performing 'minor' PHP updates that killed code that was written in then normal accepted PHP coding methodologies! Most of the 'minor' updates were performed to patch and plug documented security holes and attack issues that PHP had as a result of it's open source architecture.</p><p>Honey House Web Designs originally worked all interactive projects in PHP, but when asked to write some Coldfusion tutorials for <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FgotFusion.com%3ANCvJJ6_5MssUx3wdcQO-c5WsPeA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="gotFusion.com">gotFusion.com</a> in 2003, we found that to code in CF was not only 200%+ faster, debugging was easier, and overall site maintenance was better. The improvements along with the ability to be able to trust a development platform's security and performance were so significant, that HHWD dropped all development and support of PHP projects in 2004 and have migrated all of those clients over to ColdFusion.</p><p>Viva la CF!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Really great article Ray! It get's very old hearing people put down ColdFusion with no real information to back it up. They say it's inferior too slow and a dead technology. If you have your own preference of language I get it, but to not understand whats going on in the programming world shows a lack of passion for what you do. Thanks again!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I liked both your article and Jason's post.</p><p>When most people knock ColdFusion, it doesn't bother me any more than hearing negative stuff about other languages ... what bothered me was looking for a job around here and having recruiters tell me that there just weren't many CF jobs in the area. (The first time, I believed it a little. The second time, I translated it to mean "Companies aren't filling CF jobs through me, but I contacted you anyway because I'm not that good and I'm desperate. I know you have all this CF experience, but how about an entry-level Java position?" No, really, that did happen. Once.)</p><p>You know, if MySpace didn't like ColdFusion, that's almost a selling point for it. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi again Ray.  Here's another cfgrid question for you: is it possible to assign a click (or other) listener to the page-up and page-down buttons on the cfgrid footer?  The dataset being paged is HUGE and upon clicking either button there is no good visible feedback that the grid is working on the request.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@WP: That's a bit OT for this thread, but I'll answer. I don't know off the to of my head, but I do know you can use JavaScript to listen to keyboard clicks. So you would need to use code like that to listen to the pg up/pgn down buttons. You would then need to figure out the Ext API and determine which function to call to advance/return a page. _Should_ be doable.</p></div>
