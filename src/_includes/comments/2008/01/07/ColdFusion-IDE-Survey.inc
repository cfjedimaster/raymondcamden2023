		<div class="comment_text"><p>Finally...promise (well, maybe not promise) of a Flex-like IDE for Eclipse (I assume).  I love CFEclipse, it was the first thing that made me retire Homesite (tried *every* new version of Dreamweaver...UG). CFEclipse is much (MUCH) appreciated, but a plugin without the never-helpful variable hinting or its CFIF clumsiness and *with* code snippets (I really miss my Homesite bef/aft wrapper snippets, those guys were handy!), CFC intellisense, and full HTML (hotkeys, color picker, hinting, validation, etc.) would make me a little misty, I must say.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jason - Give Mark a house in the Hills?</p><p>I'm excited about this. The one thing that scares me is the price part. Although I would pay $100-500 for nearly bugless, fully featured software that is SIMPLE to INSTALL, I would hope that students/non-profits would get free access. At the very least, Adobe should continue helping CFEclipse along the way as an advertised free alternative.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For the price question, I choose the free option, but in the comments, I told them that I'd be equally okay with them charging money for the IDE if they made a non-enterprise version of ColdFusion Server available for free (in the interest of widening ColdFusion adoption).</p></div>
