		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray-<br>Last December I weighed over 260 pounds, and I'm sure I had mysterious illnesses -- the heart attack was the one I noticed. Since then I've lost 40 pounds and (besides the handful of meds I'll be taking for the rest of my life) I feel fantastic. Walking for two miles a day is a great way to lose weight, get some cardio, and it's not (too) difficult to do. I've got another 10/15 to go before I hit my final goal weight, but my heart isn't overtaxed as much with the smaller me. Kudos on the he idea. Maybe I'll see if I can whip up some code to allow users to track the weekly weight.</p><p>/S</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I struggled with my weight for many years.  I maxed out at around 300 pounds.  I am proud to say that over the course of two years I lost 100 pounds the old fashioned way, taking in less calories and walking.  I've been able to keep the weight off for three years now and feel great.  Just wanted to pass along a little inspiration to anyone who needs it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know that I'm ready to be publicly scorned, but thanks for the offer. :)</p><p>I could drop a few. I'm just starting slow and simple. Cutting back my soda intake and replacing that with water. I'm down from 40 oz. a day to 12 oz. a day. Or almost 600 calories a day down to 170. So, I should lose a pound every eight days or so if I can stick to it. Or perhaps, I just won't gain a pound every eight days!</p><p>Next step will be doing a few minutes of exercise a day, but we'll tackle that in Febuary :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good luck on it, hope you get what you want. Two notes:</p><p>--  Watch out for metabolic changes in late 30s... I ended up needing less calories afterwards, but it took me awhile to realize this change.</p><p>--  One killer tip for lowering caloric intake is to start getting phobic about teeth cleaning... even fifteen minutes is enough for food to start damaging enamel (or so my dentist said). Doing a full brush/floss session immediately after each meal cuts down on idle eating throughout the day.</p><p>(Hmm, and if you want to switch off of soft drinks, then an  "electric kettle" is a good way to get hot water for tea right at the desktop... made it easier for me to change habits... a little bit of caffeine is an appetite suppressant and also increases fidgeting and overall metabolic rate.)</p><p>jd</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I got married in 1999, I was a healthy 170lbs and lived a pretty active lifestyle. Then I learned ColdFusion and got a desk job. While it has been much more lucrative financially then making sandwiches at subway, it has taken it's toll on my body. Last July I was 225 and I got to the point where it effecting my ability to sleep, and now I have high blood pressure, and my doctor tells me what my wife has been telling me for years... stop being a fatty. I'm down to 206 right now by simply eating healthier food and smaller portions, but I think I'll join your list (don't worry Ray I'll send you a separate email). A little competition may do me some good in motivating me to go for a jog a few times a week. I want to be a CFBigLoser too!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray I know the feeling, life happens and the weight goes up, without even noticing. A few years ago I maxed out a just over 235lbs and I decided enough was enough. My wife had just started doing Weight Watchers so it was an excellent time for me to make a lifestyle change and start shedding some weight to. I highly recommend Weight Watches, it's not about special foods, carbs, veggies, whatever, it's all about a balanced diet and reasonable portions. Sticking with it and learning how to eat properly helped immensely in reaching my goals.</p><p>I managed to get down to 170 and stayed there for about 1 1/2 years. This fall I was up around 180 and figured I needed to add some exercise into the mix to keep the weight down and stay in shape. Being over 30 means the body can use all the help it can get to burn calories. I started off slow and now am up to running 5 miles 3 days a week. It was a painful habit to get into but it's now become a daily routine and I look forward to a long quiet run to start off the day.</p><p>Best of luck in reaching your goals.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's another helpful tip for all you guys - track your meals at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailyplate.com%2F%3AY9m5sMPY0nG1NhUWX-FMkUR_7dY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.thedailyplate.com/">http://www.thedailyplate.com/</a>. It offers free calorie counting and tracking, unlike many of the other online weight loss sites. I'm trying to get down a size or two for my wedding dress :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You should look into the "Lemonade Diet".  I know it sounds crazy, but I researched it out for a while after a co-worker started it.  It is actually a cleanse, but weight loss is a great perk.  I lost 20 pounds in 13 days and I was able to do away with unhealthy habits at the same time.  My energy level was amazing while on the cleanse and I was still able to exercise regularly.  I swapped out the morning salt water flush though with the herbal tea instead, I just couldn't drink that much salt water.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifetrainingonline.com%2Fblog%2Flemonade-diet-recipe.htm%3A48IiRRbvKG9QWAlOwD9pUTlI2Qg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.lifetrainingonline.com/blog/lemonade-diet-recipe.htm">http://www.lifetrainingonli...</a></p><p>Thanks too for the quick response to my uploading in a cfwindow question.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use a treadmill. When I first started walking, I knew I'd use weather as an excuse. Being on the treadmill also lets me watch TV, catch up on DVDs (I watched Firefly while walking) and play DS as well. Although now that I'm walking much faster, I just play music.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Only fellow geeks will appreciate this... my wife is still scratching her head... I put a 42" flat screen TV in my basement in front of the treadmill, then bought a annual subscription to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flynda.com%3ANvMx_u-uucOajnsYQnV69PMl0MI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="lynda.com">lynda.com</a>... more geek videos that you can ever watch in a year!  And they just keep adding more!  And when I've had my fill there, I'm going over to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FKelbytraining.com%3A4ymZejROuWiZIURL2NSBjXEnUWo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Kelbytraining.com">Kelbytraining.com</a> to do the same thing. <br>The treadmill is much more palatable when I have something interesting/useful to watch.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good one, Ray - I'm exactly mid-30's and what I'd call averagely overweight. Was doing great last year, dropped 20 lbs and started to feel better than I had since going from physical construction work to full time brain-exertion-body-coma about 8 years earlier. And then it turned cold, and some stressful stuff landed in my lap, and work got too heavy for good sleep... all the usual, and 10 of that 20 is back. Argh.</p><p>Just last week I decided I'd had enough... the real kicker is the ol strain in the back coming back... all about the extra load in the front! My thing is light exercise - long walks in the summer, pilates in the living room in the winter... and simply being aware of how many calories are in the stuff I cram in my face.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for this... I've dropped 2 lbs already since getting focused again, ready to go another 20 if I can, even slowly. I'll email to get on your list. And heck, all the hot studly ex-chubbo's are gonna give CF a whole new image!</p></div>
