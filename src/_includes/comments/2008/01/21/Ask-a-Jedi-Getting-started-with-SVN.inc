		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bid Mad Kev - just download Subversion. The install should be rather simple. Once you have SVN installed, this gives you access to the SVN command line tools. Then you would use what the book describes to you. Does that make sense?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I ditto what Kurt said.  SmartSVN is great if you need a client and you're not into using Subclipse.  It's way better than TortoiseSVN in my opinion.</p><p>Another option instead of running SVN in-house is to use a service provider like CVSDude.  It's a cheap alternative as you don't have to manage it platform and it include Trac or Bugzilla, WebDAV storage and email lists.  It's worth the investment as they do 10 minute hot backups which I doubt most people think about if they run SVN in-house.  It's easy to get SVN running, but then you have to deal with backups which everybody forgets to do.  Who cares if you have version control when you don't have backup to restore from in emergencies?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Some mac notes:  SmartSVN worked pretty well for me, even better after i upgraded to the pro version, which was well worth the price.  Also, in Leopard svn now comes pre-installed, and i think it's the latest version or pretty close to it (it's 1.4.4).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>oh yeah, about CVSDude, I used them for a while, and they were excellent, but I feel like they are actually a little bit overpriced.  Subversion really isn't that hard to pick up and you'd be making a much better investment learning how to use it yourself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lola, Subclipse (afaik) won't let you manage (ie create) a repo. You would follow the docs for SVN to make your repo on your leopard box. Then you would use Subclipse to talk to the existing repo.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use subversion in my every-day work activities, and I've used both Subclipse and TortoiseSVN, as well as command line on linux. I have to say that I've always been very disappointed with Subclipse - All of its features (especially its diff tool) is very, very sub-par compared to Tortoise's. I deal with coworkers all the time that have to do complete checkouts of repositories because subclipse screwed up their workspace during a large switch or merge action.</p><p>I'm disappointed to hear that you haven't found a good Mac SVN client, Ray. I'm going to be buying a macbook in the next week (I haven't used Mac's since my old PowerPC 60 Mhz box and the old apple CRT's... oh how time flies) and I'm starting to look into software more.</p></div>
