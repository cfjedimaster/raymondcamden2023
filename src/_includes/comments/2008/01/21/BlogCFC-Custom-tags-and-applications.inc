		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks.  And making it "plugable" is definetely something a lot of future users would like.  The deal is to save time by not having to rewrite, or write code.  Now that people see your blog everywhere, choosing and downloading yours feels almost second nature.</p><p>Thanks Ray.</p></div>
