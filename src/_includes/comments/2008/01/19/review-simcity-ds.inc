		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sounds fun.  I have fond memories of playing the original.</p><p>I read earlier this week that the original SimCity code has been released as open source code under the name "Micropolis," so we may see more variations of the old SimCity pop up in the months to come.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you haven't played Civ4 yet, give it a try.  There is a Mac version, but I do hear that it's a bit of a beast.  I almost gave up on Civ after Civ3, which I didn't enjoy at all.  Civ4, however, completely redeems the series.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Haahaa, ya Sim City can be addictive.  I have been playing a game called World of Warcraft (aka. World of Warcrack - very addictive) for about 3 years now.  However I think I may move to Stargate Worlds.  I am a huge Stargate Atlantis/SG-1 fan and I am really looking forward to this game.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>SimCity . . . ah, that brings back fond memories.  I'm not much of a big game player, but if there is a decent version, I might give it another go.</p></div>
