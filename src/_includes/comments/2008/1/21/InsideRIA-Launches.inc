		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congratulations, Ray!  And so the Empire grows...</p><p>It'll be good to have ColdFusion's AJAX functions and Spry represented on this site along with other more recognized RIA technologies like Flex.</p><p>And like I've said before (I think in a comment on your New Year's post), I think you'll love learning jQuery.  I've got a ColdFusion app that's about to go into production that has a number of jQuery-powered UI tools, and it's been a fun experience.</p></div>
