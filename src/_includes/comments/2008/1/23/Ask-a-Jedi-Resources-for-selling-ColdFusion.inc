		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi - I've recently had to take on more of a director's role with my primary client. This role has frequently pushed me into meetings where the firm's principal and I are selling our services. CF-related projects make up 90%+ of our interactive business.</p><p>I do articulate all the regular stuff (rapid development, easier maintenance, etc.) but here are a couple of talking points I've used to great success:</p><p>1. Easy and efficient creation of printable web content in the form of PDFs<br>2. Excellent integration with RIAs (this point has gone over incredibly well)<br>3. Performance and stability (with CF8's insane improvements in speed/processing, I've been able to use this to our group's advantage)<br>4. Interoperability (we can use .NET objects previously built, Java extensibility, etc.)</p><p>I don't use it often but, every now and again, I do love to throw out the "you get what you pay for" line when hitting resistance to using CF over free servers ala PHP or Ruby.</p><p>Best,<br>Craig</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, I think it's a matter of how you present it to the client. If you approach the client in a timid and hesitant nature, the client may sense that and assume that you and CF may not be capable of handling the project. Me personally, I don't care if they have a php, asp, jsp, .... site, I will convert them to CF or i'm not working on the project. Usually the client can tell how much I love CF and after showing them some of the stuff i'm working on or have worked on, they're sold immediately. I have had "shoppers" who come to me and than go to others who may use something else, in one case the client went to an asp shop and the guys there told him that CF is a dying language. I was pissed and I tried to explain to the client and reason with them, but they were sold on asp. It didn't even matter to them when I brought up the fact that Adobe, a huge company, aquired the language.</p><p>To sum it up, you're going to win some and you're going to lose some, just don't get discouraged when the latter happens. I think Ray mentioned in the post that unless the client is huge, more than likely they will be on a shared account, so cost of CF shouldn't come up. On the other hand, if the client is huge and they need an enterprise app, i'm sure they can afford the licensing and the cost should not be a factor.</p><p>Good luck with your biz, and good luck to all the other CF'ers!</p></div>
