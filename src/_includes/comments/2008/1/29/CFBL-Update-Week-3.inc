		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sounds like you need more aerobics Ray.  Get that heart pumping and make some sweat.</p><p>I discovered Time Warner Cable has an On-Demand channel called Fitness TV.  I have not watched it yet, but on the web site they list Carmen Electra as a trainer!  Wooo Hooo!</p><p>I have done Tae-Bo in the past and it is a bit more "manly" then other aerobic DVD's.  You should put it on your wish list.</p><p>My biggest improvement so far is my diet.  I totally cut out the fast food and bring my lunch to work now.  Saves me money and calories.  I am avoiding most everything that is white, but i have not cut out all of the carbs (i think that is too extreme).  Favorite food so far is Taco Salad.  Made with lean ground beef and half of those taco seasoning packets (to reduce the sodium) lots of lettuce, salsa, a little cheese and a dab of sour cream.  Fills you up and tastes good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, and all the other resolutely resolved losers:<br>It's great that you're keeping track of your efforts and sharing them.  'Just losing one pound' is not a bad week!  Maybe not as much progress as you want, but still progress.  Yoda would advise patience.</p><p>It's normal for your body to get accustomed to a regular routine, so if your regular exercises seem less effective, it's probably not your imagination.  One answer is to just do more.  That works to a degree, but at some point you need to mix things up.</p><p>Adding a little jogging to your walk is good and I like Chad's suggestions.  You also might consider sprinkling in other things if you (or your body) get bored, like swimming or yoga.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not doing your CFBL, but am trying to lose a little weight!  You guys keep me motivated.  But just wanted to say I have used the Time Warner On-Demand Exercises. Like all videos there are some you like and some you don't.  There are some really great Abs workouts on there!!  Keep up the great work everyone!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I promise this is on-topic, just keep reading.</p><p>So my girlfriend came over this afternoon while I was in the shower. I came out of the bathroom in a towel, not knowing she was sitting at the desk in my room surfing the internet. She turned around and basically SCREAMED. She said I had the hottest body she's ever seen in her entire life. I'll stop the story there.</p><p>Honestly, I owe it all to the CFBL contest. After one week, I've shed 3 lbs., and completely refactored my body. Women want me, I feel like my boss is going to give me a promotion based just off of my looks, and I can wear clothes I haven't been able to fit into for WEEKS.</p><p>THANKS CFBL!!!!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You guys might find this site useful:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.traineo.com%2F%3AvLomV5mcivcJaGGifjRrv87nUpA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.traineo.com/">http://www.traineo.com/</a></p><p>If you can, choose swimming over running - your knees will thank you! Also, having just joined a club myself I would highly recommend joining a karate (or similar) club. It's a great workout and you learn something really valuable along the way - it's also way cheaper than gym membership.</p><p>Keep up the good work. And remember regularly exercising your body makes it produce more mitochondria (the bits of your cell responsible for burning the calories) in the muscles your using - more mitochondria = more calories burnt = higher metabolic rate!</p></div>
