		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea, I was just reading more about dzone and it looks like it could cause some duplicate content.  Personally, I wouldn't mind.  If it causes confusion you can always remove it.  Though its easy enough to add it to my feed list too. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, the CF Zone is original content - not aggregated stuff.  I posted two articles there myself today.  I encourage everyone to sign up and post stuff - it's very easy.</p><p>I see it as our chance to reach out to developers using other languages to try and sway them to CF.  Thus the reason I'm posting some basic kinda stuff over there for now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recently blogged about the fact that they added "coldfusion" as one of the tags you could choose for any link you post to their main link collection at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdzone.com%3ATm-6e-5WPPn61gNCM9irJOh6g8M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="dzone.com">dzone.com</a>.</p><p>Which leads to a small dilemma:  is it better to post a link the main link collection, with the hope that enough people vote it up to put in on the main page in front of all the casual browsers of Dzone, or to post in the ColdFusion zone of the site, where the chances of it getting approved and published are high but only ColdFusion folks will be exposed to it?  There doesn't seem to be any cross-pollination between the two, so far as I can tell.</p><p>Guess it depends on the post and who it's directed at.</p><p>And as dilemmas go, it's a pretty good one.  :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well Brian, here's the thing.  You can actually submit CF Zone articles to the main portion of DZone - in fact I'd encourage folks to do that...so it's a win-win.  The purpose of CF Zone is to get the exposure to non-CF folks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Todd:  I see, the CF Zone links are included in the main link list, but do the "coldfusion"-tagged items from the main list make their way to the CF Zone?  That's unclear to me.</p><p>Seems like the best bet is to post a link in the ColdFusion Zone and get it approved, and then it will appear in both places.</p></div>
