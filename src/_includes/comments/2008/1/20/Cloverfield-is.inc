		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,<br>Same here, saw it Friday night, at first the shaky cam thing was bit to get used to but... It really did work for this film! I loved this movie and for those who are on the fence to see it please do yourselves a favor and not wait to see it on DVD, "This movie is best seen in a theater". No spoilers from me, just an endorsement to go see it, well spent money.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John: Yeah that's definitely something people who are going to see it should know about: the constant movement of the camera. At the theater I was at there was "evidence", at the restrooms, of how strongly it affected some people. If you easily suffer from motion sickness, take something right before and then enjoy the ride :)</p><p>My only complaint about it was the MPAA rating. To me there was quite a bit that would be too much for a 13 yr old (girl behind the curtain at the medical setup anyone?). But that's just me. I think even with an R rating it still would've brought in the record $41 million that the news outlets are reporting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmmm....On Friday night on the local news (Boston) they had someone "on the street" talking to moviegoers as they were coming out of Cloverfield and pretty much everyone said it was terrible (a lot of them talked about the motion sickness from the jerky camera work). I guess it's one of those movies you either love or hate.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Tony - I noticed people complaining as well, and my wife really didn't care for it at all. I think you are right. Blair Witch had the same reaction. Oddly - even though I do get motion sick pretty easy (I really need to get my eyes checked), I didn't feel a thing at the movie.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>ScottP - I think Adrian is wrong. There _is_ something to look for - but it is at the very end of the film, not after the credits. (AFAIK) I won't say it here - even though it's not terribly important, but if you Wikipedia the movie, you will see what you missed. I missed it too - but my wife saw it.</p></div>
