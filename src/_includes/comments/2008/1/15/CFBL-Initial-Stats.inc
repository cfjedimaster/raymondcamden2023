		<div class="comment_text"><p>While I'm not overweight, I do consider myself out of shape by my standards.  I used to work out 5 days a week, for about an hour each time.  I could bench over 300, squat over 400.  But then the kids came.  In the almost 5 years since I had my twins, my weight has actually dropped from 220 to 205.  You might think this is a good thing.  But its not.  My BMI (body mass index) has gone up.  Anyway, I had remained a member of my gym all these years since the kids came.  But time was against me.  I drop the kids off at daycare, then go to work, then pick them up.  No time for the gym.  Gym time became scarce until I finally stopped going.</p><p>But in November, I discovered a fantastic piece of equipment.  They are called SelectTech Dumbbells.  They are made by Bowflex.  They are adjustable dumbbells and don't take up more than about 2 square feet of space.  Between them and the adjustable bench I got from Bowflex as well, I can now do 90% of what I was doing in the gym.  They aren't the cheapest products but they are definitely worth it.</p><p>You can find more about them here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bowflexselecttech.com%2Fbst_microsite%2Fhomepage.jsp%3ApcdvaRIkbsf2eqOZ3tLnoEWJ5vo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bowflexselecttech.com/bst_microsite/homepage.jsp">http://www.bowflexselecttec...</a></p><p>Remember, exercise is as important as diet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I sent you a mail with my stats (a shameful 246). I'm away for a week as from tomorrow on holiday/vacation, so probably won't make much progress, but after that I'll be walking to work and back each day (which is a 6 mile round trip). I used to go to the gym daily and only 3 years ago I weighed about 190. How easily things can slip if you spend all day at a keyboard. =(</p><p>Anyway, just wanted to say good luck guys - I can't wait to see those figures start to drop!</p></div>
