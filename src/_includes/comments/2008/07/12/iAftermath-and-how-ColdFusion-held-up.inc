		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, gratz on the free advertising ;)</p><p>I just wanted to point out that I do not think either error is related to what you may think. SQL Server is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second, so I would probably blame this on the hardware it is hosted on, JDBC driver or code. Is your database hosted on the same server as your website?</p><p>In regards to the error you were having with the cache, again, RAM memory is incredibly fast and reliable. Therefore I would probably look deeper into the cause of that error as it sounds like it may have something to do with the mechanics of the scopecache tag. You may have a memory leak issue in the code? Were you able to track the server's memory usage at all during that time?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's weird that SQL Server was erroring like that. We're running MySQL InnoDB and we insert 10's of thousands of records per day and have not had any issues like that. But on the other hand, we do have a beast for a dedicated database server which probably helps having the db separated from the actual front end servers.</p><p>Congrats on the post, I was amazed when i went to the blog and seen that many comments in a matter of hours, I had to open it up myself and look to see if it was a spam attack or whatever it was.</p><p>From my experience, I've installed blogcfc for several people and I've noticed that it is very search engine friendly and gets indexed quite easily. In your case, you're using analytics to start with so that gives google an inside track to the return traffic you have which helps them determine that your site is worthy of indexing. When I switched to analytics on one of my sites, in a matter of months we went from 500 to 1000 referrals a month to 7000 referrals a day.</p><p>Keep up the great work!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ah yes, the good old standard SQLServer / JDBC Driver deadlock error. We've been getting that little gem for a while now in our web app, and although its incidence dropped with our beefy new DB server, it still pops its head up now and again. Either SQL Server doesn't do well with locks, or the driver is doing something weird, or perhaps it's something else that shows up under load.</p><p>Now that we're on SQL2005, we're looking at using SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT; on our SELECTs, which should avoid using locks. More info is here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fms173763.aspx%3A-z_1OJIyjv26okyAq1wXPn57mUU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173763.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/e...</a></p><p>Note that we haven't actually done this yet, but it's on my list and looks like it might help to stop SELECTs creating locks when they really don't need to.</p></div>
