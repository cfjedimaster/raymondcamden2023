		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Thanks for the review.  I've been hoping that Apple would allow Flash to be installed just to get Pandora.  Now that Pandora's on it I'm going to get one.  Is there a monthly fee for it?</p><p>To move stuff to your laptop you may want to try out ipod Access from Findley Designs: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.findleydesigns.com%2Fipodaccess%2Findex.html%3AE3q3CO-k4mqEwNX3mRHm2lfNt1Y&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.findleydesigns.com/ipodaccess/index.html">http://www.findleydesigns.c...</a>.  The site says it works with iphone.  I've been using it on my ipod video for some time now without any problems.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>hey Rey, this isn't an app store app but one I bought the other day for the iphone and i frickin love it! <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nakahara-informatics.com%2Figetmobile%2F%3A0NtVX-eKC8iBMPpI5NVJK16KjRM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nakahara-informatics.com/igetmobile/">http://www.nakahara-informa...</a></p><p>Basically it lets you browse your home computers from your iphone and see, get or have files emailed. I went to the bank yesterday to open a new biz account and forgot my biz ein # which is on an external drive at home but no problem... just browsed to it on phone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Enigmo is a fun game, not free though.  I also bought Super Monkey Ball which is fun to a point and then it gets impossible (at least for me).   AOL radio is another good free one.   I also bought Band which is kinda fun if you are musically inclined (but not as cool as it could be).</p><p>Most of the rest of the stuff I use you already mentioned.</p><p>By the way, you have the check box for sync applications check in iTunes right? On the Application tab? That might be your syncing problem - I didn't have that checked at first.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you're looking for something like adium, check out something called BeeJive.  I am using that on a 1.0 iPhone.  It won't work across edge, so I'm hoping that the 2.0 version will take advantage of the greater data speeds when WiFi isn't available.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Darrel: I may not have been clear. I don't want to move files from the iPhone to my laptop. I want to delete files from the iPhone and add to it - from my non-primary machine, ie, my laptop. I've contacted FindleyDesigns since their products seems to only be one way.</p><p>@rob: Yep, I had the checkbox on. As I said, it seemed to "kinda" work, cuz when I added an app that I had added via iTunes, the iPhone kinda knew I had already had it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Last Friday I upgraded my iphone to the 2.0 OS and went crazy in the app store.  I actually only had two problems:</p><p>1) After downloading the iphone 2.0 software the upgrade installed but wouldn't re-activate my phone. That was annoying.  It pretty much made it an emergency-only phone for a while.  A few hours later it was able to do the activation and I started playing in the app store.</p><p>2) One of the games I bought, Supermonkey ball, I think, wouldn't download on day one.  It started, made it about half way through and then popped up a message saying I'd have to try again later from itunes.  I tried several times on Friday but never got the app to download.  On Saturday it worked just fine and I was able to sync the app to the iphone.</p><p>The apps I bought (or downloaded) in no particular order:</p><p>- Trism (not free).  A puzzle game where you match colors and tilt your phone to play.  It's quite interesting, but it may be just a hair over rated.</p><p>- Tetris (not free).  I'm a tetris fiend.  I didn't expect the iphone version to be so damned cool, but it is.  The first time I used a finger gesture to move a shape I realized just how cool it is.  That, and there's a variant on the game which is cool.</p><p>- Bejeweled 2 (not free).  I'm not sure why I bought this.  I'm kinda embarrassed.  But, the game is good and I enjoy it.  It's pretty much identical to the PC version.</p><p>- Enigmo (not free).  I know a lot of people like this game.  I thought I would as it reminded me of The Incredible Machine from when I was a kid.  However, I'm not so thrilled by it.  It's really hard for me to move the pieces around to where they need to be.  My fingers are just too fat for this game.</p><p>- Morocco (free).  I haven't played this yet, but that's for the suggestion.</p><p>- Super Monkey ball (not free).  I really thought this would be a cool game, but it's not (yet).  It's way to freakin' hard to move your monkey around.  The reviews on the app store are spot on with this game.  Read them before you buy.</p><p>- Pandora (free).  Now this is one cool app!  My laptop has all my music and is in a different location from my living room with my stereo and my garage with my tools.  Now being able to listen to pandora in these locations should just rock!</p><p>- Light (free).  A flashlight, what else can you ask for.  You know what gets me?  There are at least two pay-for competitors.  Exact same features.  How sad!</p><p>- Phonesaber (free).  Love it.  Makes my son jealous when I play with it.</p><p>- Jared (free).  Takes me back to Macromedia Director 5.  If you used it and know of the Easter eggs in it you just may understand.  That, and it makes me think of Jared Rypka-Hauer now.</p><p>- Moo (free).  Makes the iphone moo when you shake it.  Now, honestly, who can say no to this?</p><p>So that's what I've downloaded.  I'm looking forward to seeing what new apps we get in the next year.  I'd like to see more nice productivity applications, but all things in good time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>In terms of figuring out how to install things - that is a little bit strange the first time, but if you have "bought" a free song of the week in iTunes Music Store it is the same procedure - you click (or tap) on the "Free" icon. iPhone requires one more tap, true.</p><p>Apart from that, my upgrade went smooth, so willbuy the new iPhone in a bout two weeks methinks, when O2 in UK has sorted their silly system.</p><p>So far, downloaded the following free apps:</p><p>- Pangea VR - mighty impressive panorama images on your iPhone - just how smooth it tilts and all... wow!</p><p>- Remote - works sooo nice on iTunes, on the AppleTV I think gthey need another little patch. Was a bit buggy at first.</p><p>- these free basic phrase books for Spanish and French - never knwo when you might find them handy</p><p>- Bloomberg - VERY cool!!</p><p>- Shazam - you hear a song you like, launch Shazam - 30 Seconds later you know what artist and track it is and you can even, surprise, surprise, go straight to the iTunes Music Store to buy it - very sleek app</p><p>What's really amazing is how fast the app store is expanding... this will dominate the mobile world within 6-12 months methinks. Nokia bought Symbian too late, the Symbian Alliance or Microsoft can't keep up.</p><p>Love the iPhone App Store concept, and the dev tools from Apple are simply awesome.</p><p>(Btw: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fme.com%3AMyUZst6iqO6iGKi7Ytn-D9HG0yc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="me.com">me.com</a> seems to have caught up with its initial glitches now too!)</p><p>Jonas</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>So far the apps have been downloading and working well. I bought three applications so far, amongst some free downloads.</p><p>Birdie, cuz I'm a golf nut and it's freaking awesome for any golfers out there. In fact, I already created a course online, downloaded it to the iPhone and played/scored it. Very fun but, sadly, $20.</p><p>I also got Tetris and, as mentioned above, it is awesome.</p><p>The other one I bought is Fuel Gauge. I haven't had a chance to use it yet (no fillups since I downloaded it Friday).</p><p>Phone Saber cracks me up and drives my two dogs bat sh$t crazy, which just cracks me up.</p><p>Too fun...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Super Monkey Ball seems fun, but it's hard.. I pretty much die within 3 levels every time, but I haven't played much with it yet. Bejeweled 2 I played a good bit... it's as addictive as the original, but louder, prettier, and faster.</p><p>The two big apps for me are the same two I used constantly when I had a jailbroken iphone... the "flashlight" that just turns your screen white; and Voice Notes. Simple, but very handy.</p><p>Beyond that, Yes/No Free is pretty fun. Just ask your phone a question and click the button for a random yes/no response. Had fun playing with that with the ladyfriend over the weekend.</p><p>Midomi was fun to play with, even if it only guessed the right song about 1/3 of the time. Epocrates was pretty neat, too,</p></div>
