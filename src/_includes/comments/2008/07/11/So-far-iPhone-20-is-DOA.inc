		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh yeah - anger aside - I love my iPhone. I finally can check my mail from my phone, do texting easily, and I liked the apps there were in 1.x, but 2.0 is really going to explode things (when it actually works ;). It's also great for planes. I watch movies on it and since I've done that - flights have gone a heck of a lot faster for me.</p></div>

I broke down and opted to call Apple. Once I get to a tech, which I am sure will happen in the next 12 hours :), I'll let you know what I find.</p><p>It does seem like it's a bandwidth thing but...</p></div>

The error was in itunes and whenever I would click on the iPhone on the left side of iTunes, the error would come up.. error 9838... the solution: I had to close iPhoto... then it worked perfectly after that... I think its because iPhoto was trying to bully iTunes into letting it read photos instead of go ahead and upgrade.... hope this helps (iPhone is working perfectly now..</p></div>

I think I'm about 40 mins in now.</p><p>(And by the way, this is easily the most quickly viewed blog entry I've written. 40 mins old and close to 700 views. Dang it I need to add some more ads! ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Same for me!  Just tried to download the 2.0 software - it went through the 20 minutes or so process, and right at the end came up with the error - 9838 message, leaving the iphone only able to make emergency calls.  The graphic on the screen is requesting that I connect with itunes, but every time I do, the same error message comes up, saying - There was an error in the iTunes Store.  Please try again later.  Fantastic!!  I am now unable to access any of my iphone details on iTunes!  Has anyone on the planet been able to successfully download 2.0 I wonder?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Got the new iPhone, plugged it in. Just sat for half an hour waiting for itunes store. Contacted O2, and they say that the phone has to be activated by them before it can be activated by itunes. This apparently can take "up to 72 hours". That sounds really intelligent!</p><p>Thought, OK, I'll upgrade the software to 2.0 and on my original iphone. Took ages to load the new software, and finally when the itunes restarted the phone, got (unknown error -9838) message. Now getting the same message on both the old and new iPhones.</p><p>You would have thought they'd be a little more organised than this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got through to Apple Tech Support. They said they're slammed and that this error is happening to everyone. The only solution is to "wait for a bit and then plug the phone back into the computer." She said that the firmware has installed, but it needs to connect BACK to the iTunes Store to verify, and since it can't get through, it's bricking the phone. Very nice person, my hold time was 30 seconds, tops. So, I'm waiting. Worse case scenario? I get a 3G phone later. :) Great device, worth the minor headache</p></div>

When I got home, I tried to sync and got the 9838 error message.  I got through to Apple iPhone support and the tech said the 9838 message means their server is too busy.  He said their servers are slammed at the moment and if I wait until later, when the servers are less busy, it should work.  I hope this helps.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I posted earlier that I was having the same problem.  Well, now all is fixed.  Error 9838 is a 'Server Overload' error.  You don't have to repeatedly click off and on your iPhone in iTunes to get it to work.  In fact, by doing this, you lose your place in 'line'.  If you just wait, it will finish.  Mine updated and is currently making phone calls on 2.0 software after a 40 minute wait.  This just goes to show when 6 million iPhone users upgrade all at the same time, servers start to panic.  Have patience!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the same 9838 error as everyone else. After reviewing posts, it seemed to me it's just a web traffic issue. I kept hitting my iPhone in iTunes over and over, and finally got a new screen instead of the error, stating that no more iPhone activations could be completed at this time, try again later. So I unplugged my iPhone and plugged it back in, and voila.</p><p>So just keep trying, eventually you might get through.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>FINALLY!!! It worked.  I used the method some have suggested-- clicked on ringtones and then back to the phone over and over.  It was accessing itunes for awhile, but finally worked.  Since the servers are slammed, the more times you try, the more chances you have to connect (in theory at least).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finished the download for the software and had  it put on the iphone ages ago, now i have been trying for over 2 hours to get it to connect to the store, i got the (-9838) error several times now, and i finally got it to "accessing itunes store..." and it gave me error (-4), and i have to idea what to do at this point.  You would think that after the fiasco of the first night of the iphone 1.0 launch they would have brought in more servers to deal with the obvious problem.  the secret is that they don't care how long we wait because in the end we will still like the 2.0 software.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>this is ridiculous.  though i am glad that it is not only me the one experiencing the issue, like nunya said, you would think they would figure something out by now to avoid this kind of problem.  i have been an apple fan for about 5 years now and this is really disappointing.  to top it all off i drive to the store nearby and #1 they won't let you in (because their ego is over the roof) and think it's cool to make a scene and only let iphone buyers in.  #2 they tell me there is nothing i can do andthat i have to wait - without a working phone until the problem is fixed (this is when i thought it was only me with the problem).</p><p>overall Apple needs to step their game up if they want to be known for reliability and by now be prepared to face problems wit software that they seem to "never expect"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't understand Luc's comment above about "losing your place in line" if you disconnect and reconnect. After I get the -9838 error it doesn't appear to be doing anything, it's not hanging, it just stops doing anything at all, so it seems to me I need to unplug and reconnect in order to try to re-establish a connection to the server? Thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was having the same -9838 error message and tried unplugging several times but nothing would work.  But then I decided to be a little more patient.  I clicked between the itunes store and iphone tabs in itunes until I didn't get the error message and it just sat there attempting to connect.  I left it there and finally my phone was able to connect.  My iphone was alive for a few secs but then went into another restore mode.  This time a progress bar is on my screen but it's going very slowly.  Maybe I'll be good to go when it's done...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i think if you have the "accessing iTunes Store" screen you should not disconnect. i think that is the goal. if it is spinning on that screen at least something is happening. i think if you are getting the 9838 error and hitting OK you have to eject then reconnect until you hopefully get the "accessing iTunes store" which from reading this board i have the impression can last for 40 minutes but then may work.</p><p>others thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>took a long while - with the 9838 error.  I did close iphoto.  That did not immediately work.  Likely the busy server issue.  Finally the connection to itunes worked and the phone is restored and working.  The sync did take much longer than usual after the connection</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A ray of hope out there... I've [finally] upgraded successfully by just rebooting the iphone on the dock and clicking between iphone and iTunes store. I think it was just patience, faith in karma and luck in getting through a window to the store to finish the upgrade. I still get the error (-9838) due to traffic I assume but I'm current and I have a working phone. Thank to everyone for the company and posts while I sweated this out. To all of you still waiting... hang in there.</p></div>

The people at the AT&amp;T store were having problems activating the phones and no one where i picked mine up was able to activate.  So they sent me home and said that i should be able to activate it myself.  Well i have been trying for over an hour now and have had no luck.  I am also getting error message 9838.  If anyone knows what to do please share!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>this is mind boggling. why are people waiting in a line for 12 hours to buy a phone that will be available every single day starting today? Just to show your friends you were one of the first to buy a 3G iPhone? I will never understand that mindset. You don't have to wait in line like you're buying bread in the former USSR to buy a freaking cellphone...I'm also having the same problem upgrading the software. But maybe I am more patient than the rest. It's not a big deal, I have other phones and once this traffic problem subsides, my iPhone will be updated...today, tomorrow, in a few minutes, in a few hours. It's not the end of the world.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought I was all happy - got to an AT&amp;T store early and only waited 2 hours to get my shiny new phone.  Oh, but wait, AT&amp;T couldn't activate it.  "Just take it home, plug it in iTunes, and you'll be all set."  Yeah.  That was 2 hours ago and I'm still getting iTunes errors like many folks here.  To add insult to injury, though, AT&amp;T moved my cell service off the old phone onto the new one.  Since the new one ain't activated yet and it doesn't seem it will be any time soon, I have NO cell phone service at all.</p><p>I expect such shananigans from AT&amp;T, but I really expected better from Apple.  Here's Apple launching their new, much anticipated product - one would think that they would have done just a little planning to accommodate the demand.  They really blew it.</p></div>

If you plug your phone into your computer and hold down the home button for around 30 seconds it goes into a hard reset and will restore from iTunes.</p><p>Sadly with the way they are being nailed right now you may still have trouble registering it still because it is looking to confirm you are a authorized AT&amp;T customer.</p><p>Wish everyone luck.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't find the image capture trick to work...the only thing that did was the brute force method of clicking between the music library and the iphone.  After about 100 clicks, and one false alarm, it took.  Another quibble about this whole thing is that 9838 is listed as "an unknown error", when it seems pretty clear what the error is.  I would have at least appreciated an honest error message (e.g., "iTunes servers are busy, please try again later"), because until I read these posts, I had some concern that my phone was in trouble.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hang in there people.  I'm in the UK, and have an original iPhone which had version 1.1.4 of the software on it.  I decided to update it to version 2.0 to see what the fuss was about, and it looked like it had wiped my phone.  All I had on the phone was the connect to ITunes icon, and iTunes saying there was a network error to connect to iTunes store.  After finding this blog, I've been clicking on and off my iPhone for over an hour and finally the install has completed and I have my phone back (notes, txts, contacts etc).</p><p>*phew*</p></div>

We'd be stuck without a phone for months!!!!</p><p>enjoy...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thankfully I can confirm that once it does connect, the phone is ok. The people who think that they did something (clicked ringtones, closed iphoto, etc) were just seeing coincidences I am sure. All I did was keep trying every once in a while over the last hour.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>for anyone sitting with the "accessing itunes store" screen, don't disconnect! a lot of us have been trying for an hour to get there. the alternative is an immediate 9838 error. i just got the "accessing itunes store" error for the first time in about 90 minutes. i'm expecting it to take a while but i consider this at least a step in the right direction.</p></div>

It kept giving me 9383.</p><p>Then i waited 5 minutes and tried again and it went to "Activating iTunes Store" for about 3 minutes. then -4 came up. The next time I tried, it synched and worked.</p><p>The whole thing took about an hour from when I first downloaded the update.</p><p>so it WILL happen, do not worry and  don't bother calling apple.</p></div>

Did any of you really think that there wasn't going to be network slowdowns this morning? Let's be serious. I am not a patient man...trust me...but can only control what we can control. Everyone will get their toys working again soon. Please stop connecting and disconnecting your phones repeatedly as you will cause excess wear on those parts. Go out and get a cup of coffee and relax for a bit...it is Friday after all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you are getting the (-9839) or (-4) error when updating your iPod to 2.0... basically just connect your iPod so it displays in iTunes then click between your music library and the iPhone icon. It will take several attempts but when it does connect it goes quickly. (Basically, if it takes more than 5 seconds try clicking back and forth again don't wait around for more than a few seconds)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've used a packet sniffer to look at what is happening (full details &lt;A HREF="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjimmyblake.com%3AfNPLRqwB1XRBayct9aXyTmLxehU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://jimmyblake.com">http://jimmyblake.com</a>"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.  Basically the -9838 is, as someone pointed out earlier, a cannot connect to the iTunes Music Store via SSL.</p><p>I've look at the request and response packets via the sniffer and effectively the iTMS server is sending a HTTP Error 500-13 message, which is 'Server too Busy.  What this means is there are just too many people trying to connect for the amount of available network connections to the server.  iTunes then converts this into the -9838 message we are all seeing.</p><p>If you manage to get a progress bar, this means the connection has been established to the iTMS (you are beyond the -9838) and you should leave it to takes its course.</p><p>For some people it seems to work (not for me unfortunately) but some are bombing out with a -4 error - which is a timeout.  If iTunes doesn't receive the activation response back from the iTMS within a given period iTunes will exit with this error.</p><p>So effectively, no matter what you click before you try activation on iTunes will help in the slightest.  You just have to keep pounding away until you get a slot and hope that the iTMS can process the activation before it times out.</p><p>Annoying thing is that I already have activated my new iPhone 3G once with no problems, but I have to reset it after cocking up the synchronisation and ending up with masses of duplicates.</p><p>:(</p><p>Good luck guys.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>well still waiting, 9838 basically translates to 'sorry we're busy please try again'! Dont worry it doesnt mean your iphone is briked its just taking forever to activate all the phones (even the lite activation). AT&amp;T in America is taking forever to complete the process and O2 in UK only processed half the orders from the pre-order, they hope to have all pre-orders complete by tonight but I think its unlikely. Thats why you might only be able to do the emergency call even after activation.</p><p>Sit tight, you have the iphone and it will sort itself out in next few days!</p></div>

I use it to read news while i sit on the toilet, and to watch girls dance on youtube first thing in the morning while i need some pleasure. It is there when I need it, and not having it was like having a family member in a coma.</p><p>Luckily I am back up and running - from  9:05 AM finished 12:18PM - There is hope out there!- And the joy of seeing the Sync in Progress screen is like a joy you will have never experienced before. Your best friend opening his eyes from his coma, your family member taking a breath when you thought they drowned - THANK GOD MY IPHONE WORKS AGAIN - I love you all and thank you for keeping me updated on your progress throughout this tumultuous morning!</p></div>

The Apple logo shows up for a while then the screen flashes and the logo comes back up. Did this for nearly an hour. I disconnected the phone, restarted my iMac and did a restore. The restore went through but I'm still at the exact same start up loop thingy.</p><p>Hopefully it's the network/apple's servers are slammed thing. Gonna leave in the cradle for a while and cross my fingers.</p><p>(kicking myself for not waiting a few days to update)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 3G Phone is working, I can make calls, access the internet via 3G etc, but when I connect to iTunes it just displays 'accessing itunes store', and then displays -4 error. Won't let me sync contacts or music.</p><p>O2 help desk say that they have to activate the phone first and afterward iTunes has to activate it for syncing. This seems a little stupid to me.</p><p>Anyway, I'm gonna play super monkey ball, and leave it alone for a few hours. No point in me clogging up the system. Hope you guys don't have to wait too long (and that the traffic eases up by the time i try again in a few hours)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I just realized why it has to do this...well I talked to a MobileMe person today because my computer said that it couldn't register my phone on the syncing network..or something like that.  It must be that they have to do this so that it registers it on their network and can be used with MobileMe.  I am not sure, but I think I am on to something here.  If this isn't true, those who created this activation process for those who have iPhone gen 1 are a bunch of serious retards.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I posted earlier (9:30ish ET) to say that the firmware was stuck on the error message. It's finally started restoring at 12:30ET... 3 hours of watching it, clicking on and off the iPhone icon to get it to reconnect to the iTunes server.</p><p>But now it IS restoring the phone... though it's taking a long time.</p><p>The need for patience is true -- though Apple should have thought of this. The only good news is that with the shortage on 3G phones at the stores, 3G registrations will pretty much stop, so the rest of the day will be Edge phones upgrading to the new firmware.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well looks like I'm stuck too.  I had a successful 2.0 upgrade this morning around 7am (CST).  Then I tried to jailbreak it.  Well apparently iTunes has to be open for the jailbreak to work, and I inadvertently closed itunes during the jailbreak.  So then I had to restore it in iTunes.  Now I'm getting the same error as the other 6 million people in the world.</p><p>Awesome!!! (sarcasm)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I contacted Apple. After waiting more then an hour on the phone I explained to the tech that I updated my phone this morning and now I can't re-activate it. He basically said that there is nothing he can do, the activation servers are down and there is no ETA on when they will be available again.</p><p>At this point I got a little angry and asked him what's the point of Apple not only releasing a new iPhone but also a new update to all original iPhones if thier servers couldn't handle it.</p><p>All he said is sorry I can't help you and hung up.</p><p>GREAT SUPPORT!!! :(</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>my itunes update went fine, then it took a while to access the iphone 2.0 upgrade but then that downloaded no problem BUT NOW my iphone is in emergency call mode (like many posts here) and I keep clicking on my iphone in itunes and get a message that my itunes request cannot be completed because my network connection has been changed (which it has not to my knowledge) and to check the network connection and try again.  I am able to go into my itunes account, the itunes store, etc. without any problem.  My network connection is fine.  I wanted to take a roadtrip this morning but am not going without my phone and so I am sitting at home staring at this computer.  Any ideas?</p></div>

When I came back nothing had changed so I did a recovery mode restart (turn off phone, start itunes, plug in phone while holding down home key) and it re-downloaded the update.  Trying to sync the phone did not work the first time around but it finally did on the second try.  I think the recovery mode move helped.</p><p>Good luck everyone, there is hope.</p></div>

That being said, your simultaneous launch of the new G3 iPhone and the 2.0 software update for previous iPhones was a HUGE mistake.</p><p>     I (and millions like me, I'm sure) have been stuck without a phone for over 4 hours now because of your server issues.  With all the hype behind the new phone and the software update, the execution was horrible.</p><p>     Successful people know that you underpromise and overdeliver.  Apple has overpromised and severely underdelivered in this matter.  Grown adults have TAKEN THE DAY OFF WORK because of the amazing possibilites of your product and updates, and your poor planning has left those people feeling silly and in a position to be mocked for thinking so highly of Apple.</p><p>     I wonder how many people that RELY on their phones for business purposes have been severely effected by this down time.  I know of one for sure...</p><p>     I hope you learn from this egregious error, and have the good business sense to make amends to your loyal consumers through some sort of comps.  Good day.</p></div>

Obviously not.  C'mon, bring another 50 virtual servers up and keep your customers happy instead of locking them out in the cold for hours on end.</p><p>The sick part is all of us would have been better off upgrading yesterday with the "unofficial" firmware.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yup, i'm pissed too.  Basically, Apple put too much effort into securing their phones.  The only thing that is backlogged is the "activation."  This is especially retarded for those of us who either have the old iPhone, or were existing customers... we have sim cards that are active, so if Apple wouldn't have tried so hard to prevent phone unlocking, we would all be golden and the only people trying to activate today would be brand-new customers.</p><p>Let's hear it for customer loyalty incentives!!!</p><p>Yay AT&amp;T and Apple!!!!  Also, I give it less than a week before people are selling unlock procedures online anyway.  This is absolutely rediculous.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Same problem. Ive been on the horn with apple twice since 830 this morning and all they tell me is to keep trying or to wait until things slow down. as for the error messages try unplugging the phone exit itunes re-enter itunes then re-plug the phone.  if that doesnt work try a har drestart on the iphone.   Hold down lock button and home button until you see just a black screen and the apple symbol then let them go and it will reset  this is bs  we are all in the same boat i guess</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It took me about 2 hours, but I did finally get it to go through.  There's hope!  I had the -9838 message too many times to count.  I used the back and forth between itunes library and iphone routine.  Eventually, I got past that frustration.  Then, I sat with the "Activating phone"  message on my phone screen.  After about a half hour, I finally hit cancel, and the phone is fine.  Up and running!  Unfortunately, my husband is sitting at work still trying to get his to work. <br>I'm just glad I didn't sit in line for hours, waiting to buy the 3G, then sit at home for hours, waiting to activate it.<br>I'm so glad I found these posts today!  I knew I wasn't the only one going crazy.  Thanks for all the help!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Keeo reconnecting your iPhone to iTunes and, eventually, the connection will be made and a successful download will occur. I think it's just like my experience at the Apple store this morning - you have to get in line (which, in that case, I didn't). I've got a friend with an iPhone and he's still waiting to get to get out of that frozen mode (we both began trying for the upgrade at the same time). After a few minutes of disappointment, I was just lucky to hop into a spot on their server, I guess.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good to see peoples luck improving.  Perhaps theres a new rack of Xservers chugging away doing what should have been set up ahead of time.</p><p>Just plug it in, let the connection time out (-4) then let it sit.  It'll get there.</p><p>Then after everything's done and it restores, let it sit a good hour to re-sync 16GB of content.</p><p>I can say having played with the apps now... they're worth it!

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think after you have that connection error to iTunes store, you need to dismiss the error box and click elsewhere and click on the iphone (under devices) again so it will make the connection attempt again.  I don't think it's how long you've been trying, I think it's just a matter of sneaking in with the right time with an open connection.  Took me 45 minutes and may be 8 retries?  The AppStore is hit or miss too, I could get in and download 3-4 apps then it would not connect, but if I tried again then it would connect.  The good news is that this may drive people away from the store so I can just walk in tomorrow to get my new phone without waiting in line.</p></div>

Once I got a nice screen tell me that activation wasn't working and I should try again later.</p><p>Forcing a re-install by holding the home button whilst powering on by connecting the USB cable failed as it looks like it's not possible to revert to 1.1.4.</p><p>I'm running little snitch which tells me that when I click on iPhone under iTunes, it attempts to contact <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Falbert.apple.com%3A6GCk2t6VeW2buhbPh1DxddmuAys&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="albert.apple.com">albert.apple.com</a>, but, whilst iTunes happily proclaims "Accessing iTunes Store..." it's fibbing.

I've clicked on the Iphone button to re-start the activation to the itunes store countless times - I've also done the iphoto trick, reboot, etc.  I have no more patience but honestly there is nothing else you can do I guess - it's a network problem.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Called Apple, got in queue and put'em on hold.  Went about my business.  After about 30 minutes, my iBrick rang (wha?) and it's Apple iBrick support.</p><p>She says "The server is down.  Try again in a few hours.  Or maybe tomorrow.  If you like, AT&amp;T has offered to forward all calls to whatever number you'd like."</p><p>I query her some more.  She got an email which said "The [activation?] server is down.  We're working on it."  According to her, no activations are working now until some indeterminate time in the future.  Again according to her, Apple didn't foresee the demand on their servers today. [WTF!?]</p><p>I asked if there was any way to go back to 1.1.4.  Nope, because you still need to do the "Activation" process, and the activation server is dead.</p><p>Clearly, she's at least partially wrong as some of you (lucky) jokers ARE getting through.  But I've been trying for 5 hours now.</p><p>I told her I look forward to hearing what Apple is going to do for me to compensate me for my time and one or several days without my phone.  She grunted.</p><p>Then, "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"<br>"Um, like what?"<br>"Any other issues you're having with your iPhone."<br>"Sure, I've got plenty of issues.  But you can't help me with any of them because my iPhone is completely dead."<br>"Uh huh."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just want everyone that is sitting here reading these posts, looking for something to try to make their phone work (which is what I have been doing for HOURS), NOTHING is going to work!!!! I think there are people posting that if you click on this or click on that, your phone will start syncing, but I think the reason they think that is what worked for them is because that is what they had just done when their phone started syncing.  Believe me I have tried everything that everyone has suggested, but nothing has worked.  I was sitting here, reading some of the latest posts, and the phone started syncing on its own!!!!!  I did absolutely nothing to make it work, so the leave-your-phone-docked-and-come-back-later method works!!!!!!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's the deal: I've done everything. I've clapped, cried, sang, danced, prayed with my dog, drank vodka (calm my verves), I even placed my phone on the Holy Bible. Obviously nothing worked. I finally got my 1st gen. phone to sync and update. I've been trying since 9am (cst). It's just luck. Just keep trying and have faith! By the way, Apple blows! You'd think since they make $457889768755599 a day, they'd use our hard earned money towards better server and ISP connections. I guess that's why they are so frickin rich! Bastards!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You do realize that the more people that call, the longer its gonna take to get a call through.  Since there are about 700 of us in this blog alone calling, that already takes some time, but imagine all the independent people calling as well, i imagine that apple is getting at least 10,000 calls right now, probably more, everyone should just wait, and sit patiently, until we get the answer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was having the same issue, the emergency call screen. It just seems to be a matter of patience. Everytime I would get the error pop-up I would just click on the "iTunes Store" on the sidebar and back on the iPhone, and it magically worked. I did that for about 30 minutes. It's annoying but it's not too high of a price to pay to get your toy working again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>left mine for a few hours as I got sick of sitting here...</p><p>but it just worked, and is restoring music and video as we type ;-)</p><p>only thing I did different this time was to keep the screen on the phone open, and not let it go into powersave so to speak, so I just typed random numbers on the emergency screen and within seconds it was working ;-)))))) that said, it may be just luck and timing... worth a try though if your still stuck....</p><p>also, I had problems in the 1st instance where I had downloaded 2.0, it was hanging for a good 30-40 mins so I disconnected thinking that I had too much open on the mac and it had frozen.... Which is when the probs started with the emergency screen and all the other symptoms stated above, I also held down the home button and the power button to force a restore, and then tried to download the update again only to notice that it was 1.14 (or something, not 2.0 anyway). So I assumed it was going to reinstall an older version, BUT it seems that 2.0 is up and running as I can se the App Store in my menu items....</p><p>hope that waffle helps anyone who is puzzled out there - sorry for any typos</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That was brutal!  It took 7 hours to get my phone back!  It finally connected to the activation server about 5 minutes ago.  I clicked back and forth for a while, ignored it for a while, then clicked some more... and finally it worked.  Now I have to weed through my voicemails that have been piling up over the past 7 hours!  Best of luck to the rest of you!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was at this for hours and it finally went thru and is now syncing my music.  I do believe the key to successfully getting thru was to stare at the screen for hours, repeat the same steps, pull out some hair and throw it at the monitor and occasionally yell cuss words.  That seemed to work for me.</p></div>

Click between store and iPhone tab, you'll get through. One plus, my girlfriend feels bad that I wasted my day so she said she'll make it up to me tonight.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Had the same "slide for emergency call" problem. I docked my phone, turned it off, then back on again and iTunes now recognizes the phone and I have service again. I get a message stating that an iPhone has previously been synched w/ this computer and the option of setting up as a new iPhone or restoring to from the backup of the previous iPhone (which are one and the same). I haven't decided yet - if I restore to previous backup, will that be 1.x ver of software? If I set up as new phone will compromise my ATT account?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I tried alternatively clicking the store / songs and the iphone for hours, but with no luck. The "network error" message kept popping up. I pressed the ok button and then left it (I don't think you need to keep clicking back and forth on the phone, and store), and it activated by itself! -  took about 5 minutes wait, now it is restoring.</p><p>Sadly I've not got the 2.0 upgrade (after all that!!) - but this 4 hour wait has dampened my appetite. I can wait.</p><p>Good luck people. It can happen to you too!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Got through to the applecare site.  Here is the scoop.  The activation server has reached capacity.  There are so many people trying to activate and update, that the server can't handle it.  It is taking a long time to find everyone's previous activation information.  That is why we keep getting the message that "Itunes store can not connect, etc."  The technician said that you should leave your phone plugged into the computer and it will eventually activate.  I just plugged my phone back in and joy of joys, saw the "Sync in Progress" sign.  It also says "Waiting for activation.  This may take some time."  You may have even heard me scream.  So I hope this helps my fellow Iphoners.    TLanette</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well after 3 hours earlier this evening of trying to get it to work, I decided to switch of the pc and wait until later. I've just now connected it again and it is finally working, currently restoring music and videos. I have to say I think it is absolutely ridiculous that Apple decided to release the 3G and this update on the same day producing all of this traffic that they couldn't handle. I mean it's common sense to let the first gen iphone users update to 2.0 before the 3G is released. Apple made a huge mistake, and I really hope they learn from it.</p><p>Good luck to those of you still trying to get it work. I just hope after it has finished restoring that everything works ok. Fingers crossed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just got mine working about 20 minutes ago.  Installing apps now.  Update worked well once it started.  Been going since it first came out though I took a few hour break to give people who needed it immediately a chance to get going.  Here's a hint for once you get through.  You have to authorize your computer through itunes at the top bar on the screen under store where the file/edit/etc menu's are to install the apps.  Might save you some time.  I'm sure we could all use a bit of that :)  Try not to be too hard on Apple.  It's a good thing that there is overload, means there are a ton of users and that is great for the platform.  If you don't want a little down time maybe you should wait for day 2 to try the next install.  Hopefully they will get a better system in place sometime though to solve that in the future.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Eric - I believe they are switching the ability to start the update on and off, probably as the server traffic clears up I'd guess.  Try again in a while and it will probably let you do the 2.0 again.  I've seen it switch a few times myself.  Make sure you don't need your phone in a hurry and just leave it connected once it starts even if you get an error message.  Good luck to ya.</p></div>

(they are just the phone #'s of friends and family that were on my phone previously, not already stored in Outlook or anything like that)</p><p>2) I tried to download a free application - Remote.  went to apps store, downloaded it, but when i try to sync applications it says "The Application 'Remote' was not installed on the iPhone because you are not authorized for it on this computer."

This device really pulls in traffic, huh?</p><p>Well, all I can add is that my iTunes didnÄt show the updated 2.0 firmware so I manually downloaded and installed it - after a bit of synching/backing up, it was running quickly (about 20 minutes in total I'd guess).</p><p>The REMOTE Function of AppleTV and iTunes alone is worth it, LOL - awesome stuff!  And the Bloomberg App is a fantastic improvement over the earlier stock app too.</p><p>This thing will fly in the business world... soo many possibilities, and the SDK for us developers screams quality.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw last night that the apps store was up and running so I bought and downloaded a bunch of apps for my ipod touch.  This morning I got up to download the 2.0 update, all excited, only to get the message that iTunes could not access the store.  Now, hours later, iTunes is telling me that my old software version is the most current version which I know to be false.  I was so excited for the upgrade and now I have all these apps that I purchased that I can't even use because I can't get the 2.0 upgrade.  I'm so frustrated.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When you all upgraded (successfully) your 2.5G iPhones to the 2.0 firmware, did your phone go through the "re-activation" feature?  i.e. does it look for confirmation from AT&amp;T to see if you have service with them?  I'm out of the country and have suspended my service until I get home.  I don't want to brick my phone (which I'm using as an iPod, address book, etc while I'm gone) and have to wait months before I can use it again.</p><p>Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I upgraded my 2.5G iPhone to the 2.0 firmware last night after reading it was available early for manual download.  Other than my not understanding initially how to remove the .zip extention from the file name, I had no problems at all.  Downloaded the software in about 15 minutes, installed and reactivated the phone with no troubles at all.  It did ask if I wanted to activate it as a new phone or from backup (I chose backup) so I'm assuming it "knew" I had an existing contract.  I was able to download free and paid Applications last night, and all have worked perfectly all day.  Have re-synced the phone today, and the computer recognizes it has the updated 2.0 firmware, etc.  For once in my life, being impatient paid off - glad I didn't wait until today!  :)</p><p>S</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>zGlad to see I was not alone yesterday, after I finally got mine to work w/the 2.0 firmware iTunes said that my backup was corrupt, which really sucked, however once resynced  I was able to atleast get my contacts back, but I had to re-add my e-mail address and things of that nature, of course when I redid this process later in the day for my wife I of course had no such issues, the only thing was that the wait time for activation was a bit long but after that it worked and she was none the wiser that for a whole she had no phone, cause she was sleeping.</p></div>

All you had to do was disconnect your iPhone and have somebody call/text you and problem solved. Maybe this might come in handy if apple still doesn't learn their lesson with the next big update.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If anyone knows a simple solution for fixing this problem I would much appreciate hearing about it.  My 16G iphone only shows emergency calls.  I have tried to restore it and it just installs the 2.0 update again, and Im back to the same problem.  Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I guess I haven't had quite the problem a lot of you have.  My biggest issue was losing all my contacts.</p><p>However, my phone really hasn't been the same since the upgrade.  Safari/internet is a lot slower and I get an error quite often now that says it cannot connect.  Just never had that before.  Also, I am getting a lot more "No Service" with the phone in areas I have never had that problem.</p><p>Sigh.</p></div>
