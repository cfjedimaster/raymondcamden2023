		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ Jim not to mention you might have to "figure out the right answer". Now I know in programming exams that is generally the point but we all know what I mean right? It does suck though as I would have liked to do the certification myself but really what's the point if the company that issues them has issue with them?!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just finished watching the part of the preso in question. I see why your pissed honestly, but I don't think he was being specific to CF (and your participation) but to certs for all the products. Maybe there was a bad review or reviewers for some other line?</p><p>It would have been great for him to properly respond to your concerns in the chat and the previous blog post.  I am really surprised at that honestly.  If there is good feedback sent back but it goes to a black hole, then that is indeed a real problem.  Maybe that is something they can work on during the whole openness effort.  Good quality format for feedback that goes to the right person and is measurable...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@fuzie: I believe the $$ issue was being very strict on the cert itself. Ie, it costs 50k, and they sell N*whatever which earns them &lt; 50k. All the other stuff is a bit hard to measure.</p><p>@joshua: The presenter, at the end, made it VERY clear it wasn't a personal attack on myself. I leave it up here because I honestly feel its part of a bigger issue of not accepting responsibility for the cert.</p><p>I do agree though - I do wish Adobe had responded to my post. I do NOT want to sound like a diva here. I get a LOT from Adobe. Early sneak peaks. Software giveaways, etc. But again I've been surprised by the lack of response on the blog.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What is really sad here is that Adobe is not being asked to invent the wheel here.  ORACLE and Microsoft have already been doing the certification thing, much better than Adobe has, for a very long time.</p><p>Education in IT is important - period - and Adobe just doesn't get it.  I tried to hire an entry to mid level CF developer at our company (based in Indianapolis) for 2 months and guess what - they don't exist.  Why?  Because there is no new blood when it comes to CF.  Why?  Because Java, PHP and .NET have a long tradition of getting into universities via giving shit away or just because they're free offerings to begin with.  Adobe does not care about education or certification because they're still selling product (for now).  ColdFusion may already be doomed because it is no longer a dominant player in the app server market and it is not taught anywhere, grads get jobs then they rise through the corporate ranks and never they never consider CF as a solution at their respective companies.  How did you learn CF?  Self taught or taught by others at work?  Maybe you learned the hard way like I did - by building apps in it and looking through the CFWACK books to make them better.  Maybe you were lucky enough to find this blog or some others right off the bat.</p><p>At any rate, Adobe doesn't care about certifications or finding new users.  When was the last time you saw a CF add in Information Week?  I spent an hour on their website trying to map out CF and FLEX certification details and came to the conclusion that they don't care.  If they did care then I would argue that the site wouldn't have been such a mess.  Go to Microsoft or ORACLE if you want to see a software company that understands that a developer's career is often tied to a software vendor and how much they can prove they know about that software vendor's products and overall technology platform.  Recently I've developed serious worries about building a career around CF.  I'm taking my personal certification/training budget and using it on C#.</p><p>CF is my favorite and it is such a productive environment but it may be the next Novell.  Do any of you want to cross your fingers and stake your careers on a niche?  Is Adobe really spending any money to recruit new developers or show the world their great product?  No, their completely insulated and surrounded by folks who already love their stuff.  They're not out there trying to get people to switch from other solutions to CF.  Show me one shread of evidence that they are and I'll shut up and post a retraction to that statement.</p><p>When you say Adobe do your colleagues and clients immediately think Photoshop and Acrobat?  Do they even know what CF is?  Who's fault is that?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I want to applaud you for speaking out about this!  Your previous "open letter on Adobe Certification" post has affected me personally.  I had been planning on getting certified, but had never gotten around to it, and that post inspired me to kick it in gear and get the CF 7 cert while I could.  I found 1 testing center (out of 5) in my area that still offered the CF 7 exam through June 30th, and I was able to get in there and take the test on the last day!  If it wasn't for you, I would have waited around and been stuck with CF 8 or nothing!</p><p>Thanks Ray!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Jim<br>I'm well aware of this and in my opinion it is about 5 years too late.  The blame can't be completely put on Adobe as Allaire and Macromedia had the same shot and blew it.</p><p>You might say that the culture and image of our product of choice has evolved into one of being a maverick.  If you think that's pretty cool just ask Borland how that's going for them.</p><p>Anyway I'm a sore loser and I'm pissed off that my product of choice is losing.  Losing market share, losing mind share and eventually it will start losing money and it will get dropped.  And all of the truly smart people like yourself and Ray and everyone else will go off into the sunset and master something else.</p><p>Lately being a CF proponent seems probably a lot like being a Detroit Lions fan.  The team keeps getting worse and the front office keeps f@@king it up even worse.  I wouldn't know about that because I'm a Colts fan and we finally got our act together.</p><p>What's sad is that this is a terrific, feature rich product with an inventive group of users (dwindling in numbers) who would lay down in traffic for it.  CF is way better than the competition in many ways.  But the folks who have made it great over the years aren't that good at the business side of this.  How in the hell do you lose the thrown when you're the first one there?  (CF existed before ASP and PHP)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy,</p><p>I would disagree with you on this. I think the folks inside Adobe (specifically the CF team) are "getting" it more and more and come with more business savvy at the same time. People like Mike Nimer, Tom Jordahl (and other older CF engineers) have given way to newer developers and with Jason Delmore and Adam Lehman (controversy aside) on the product side, I think we can see more and more out of the CF team.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Sami,</p><p>If they're "getting it" and CF8 was released a year ago then why no marketing campaign that reaches for new users nor any mainstream advertising?  Why did it take just now before it dawned on anyone that CF is never front and center at universities or training centers (the place where many developers are born) and that maybe if it were given to colleges they might use it and expose their students to it.  Oh but wait, how could said colleges teach classes on it if there aren't any decent training materials or certification tracks that mean anything?</p><p>I live in the 12th largest city in the US and ran an ad for an entry to mid level CF developer for 4 months and had 2 qualified candidates - each of whom had more than 8 years of experience - not exactly "mid level" or new blood.</p><p>So what is it that we'll "see more and more of"?  More people picking up .NET or PHP?  It took me many many months to get this upset.  Do you think that I want to abandon a world class product like CF in favor of other products that are not as productive?  No way, but if I want to continue to grow my business I'll have to because I can't seem to hire anyone and Adobe doesn't seem to place too much emphasis on growing the user base, marketing, education, training or certification.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy,</p><p>This isn't the place to get into this here, but I understand where you are coming from. I was teaching CF in 2001, so I understand where the education aspect lacks. I've been in talks with my university to bring RAD web tools like CF and RIA into the curriculum. Also, as a hiring manager myself, I've seen the lack of talent out there as well. I've interviewed hundreds over the years. Lots of horror stories.</p><p>At the same time, I've noticed some changes inside Adobe. I've been a beta tester since version 6, and I've never had more access to make a difference myself. So maybe what I meant by "see more and more of" is what I'm seeing on the inside, and hopefully most others will see on the outside.</p><p>Adobe is a very mature company, and at the same it doesn't react quickly sometimes. In the post-Google age, its becoming less of an option to think old school.</p><p>So what am I saying? Don't keep frustrated, have some patience: keep the faith. With Railo, and changes announced for Centaur, CF is going to be accessible and "complete" than ever before; someone is listening... finally!</p></div>

First - their customer is running CF7 and migrating to 8 - let's start there.</p><p>So the "test" to "prove" my resume - was based on CF SERVER 4.5 and CF STUDIO 4.5.  Not only were the questions SERIOUSLY dated - but some of it was out-and-out BROKEN.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I can't argue or take exception to anything that Ray states.  I, too, long for the days of the ColdFusion certification program being under the wings of Allaire or Macromedia.  Adobe has been a major obstacle instead of what should be viewed as a win-win relationship.<br>However, if you do want to or have to (job promotion, training requirement, etc...) take the CF8 certification exam, you might want to consider getting CF8 Exam Buster which I just released (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcentrasoft.com%3A4a-48HFCgZ5DtDmQ6kW2-UOAr6c&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://centrasoft.com">http://centrasoft.com</a>).  I won't plug any further.  Thanks, Brian</p></div>
