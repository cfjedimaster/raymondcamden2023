I figured out a workaround that solves the binding and serialization problem for the time being.</p><p>In your CFC method, return an extra alphabetical list element that will never match any data in the first character of data--I decided to use "$" but you could use any character.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the suggestion Greg, but that doesn't change the behavior for me. Still the same result. Any other ideas? Like I said, it only seems to happen in Firefox, and it's also related to the speed you type. If I type slow enough for the autocomplete to keep up, everything is cool. But if I type really fast and hit enter the error pops up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used the autosuggestBindDelay="1" parameter (1 second) in my &lt;cfinput&gt; tag and had fewer problems with speed of typing than if I left the parameter out (default is 0.5 seconds). Set higher if needed but anything higher than 3 would not seem useful for an autosuggest feature.  The speed of your network and .cfc calls could affect performance.  If the round-trip Ajax call takes 2 seconds and your autosuggestBindDelay is at the default of 0.5 seconds, I can imagine some collisions occurring as multiple Ajax requests return in 2, 4, 6, etc. seconds.</p><p>I have the luxury of targeting only MSIE.</p></div>

And all my INT's are converted to scientific notation.  Useless.  Coldfusion screws me again.  Another example of shoddy bug tracking and implementation by the Coldfusion team.  I am committed to Coldfusion, but only because I'm forced.  After dealing with the countless bugs in cfdocument, cfchart, the entire cf8 ajax libraries... now a simple function like serializejson can't return an int???  Stupid stupid stupid.</p><p>I'm returning too much data to selectively add "$" or "," to the beginning of my integers.  Additionally, I refuse that solution on grounds of principle.</p><p>Does anyone know anything more about this?</p><p>Sorry for the rant.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm of the opinion that CF keeps adding features that sound really cool on paper but when you go to use them they don't work quite right and never get fixed. Adobe just moves on to creating the next cool sounding widget to get you to buy the next version, only to find it doesn't work the way it's supposed to either. Autocomplete, cfmail's slow performance, and Flash based forms jump to mind as examples that have caused me headaches because they sort of work, but not quite.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, we are a bit off topic now, but let me respond to this a bit.</p><p>1) Slow Mail<br>Are you sure? Last time I checked cfmail was EXTREMELY fast. I don't have the #s in front of me and I may be wrong, but I thought CF8 Ent was clocked at 500K emails per hour. Remember, once cf hands off the message, it is up to the mail server to deliver it.</p><p>2) Flash Forms/other features<br>Well, I definitely don't use Flash Forms anymore. They were added before the Flex SDF was free so now I definitely push folks to Flex. That being said, it is important to remember that now every feature is for you! Ajax is a great example of this. CF provides support for Ajax both in pluming (JSON serialization, returnFormat in CFCs) and in UI. The UI stuff isn't perfect. You can do more with Ext/jQuery UI. But for people who know little to no Ajax, it is a killer feature.</p></div>

I had read up above in this thread that javacast did NOT work... but that guy was javacast'ing to a string and not an int.</p><p>I take back what I said about Coldfusion.  Actually, I don't take it back.  Coldfusion is the pits, but its user base is excellent.  I'm always on your blogs and getting great help.

My data structures are pretty big and I don't feel much like having to javacast everything.  Though I will if I have to.  I'm just glad that I have a solution.</p><p>Thanks again!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm having the same problem with yes/no string being converted to boolean values when serialized.</p><p>Adobe needs to fix this. The JSON.cfc library is considerably slower for very large (an array of 400 + objects (with more nested structs) each with 50 keys).</p><p>But it would be even slower to iterate through this big ass piece of data and scrub it to get my data back in the correct format.</p><p>If it was a small amount of data it would be okay to add a space after "yes " and then remove it on the way back (post deserialize()), but as it stands, I am running out of options. Does any one have any suggestions?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be fair, 400+ objects with 50 keys is a lot to serialize.</p><p>That being said - if you don't need _dynamic_ serialization (ie, you know exactly what you want - you can write your own code. JSON is pretty trivial to generate. Just be sure to use stringBuffer's via createObject.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>JSON seriliazation has been much improved in CF9. As for the autusuggest tool, if it still doesnt work well for you, consider the jQuery UI one. You can use that easily enough with CF.</p></div>
