		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, thanks for sharing this (the time tracking app). I've been looking at various ones (installed and web hosted) for a couple of months, and have been annoyed by most. Yours looks nice and simple.</p><p>Of course, there are lots of directions you can go in adding to it, if you will. Any of the alternatives can give you ideas. The ones I've found are listed in my tools/resources page at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcarehart.org%2Fresourcelists%2Ftools_to_consider%2F%23timetrack%3AEIvHuB0VA7LJHEm6qjR_WyieTFc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://carehart.org/resourcelists/tools_to_consider/#timetrack">http://carehart.org/resourc...</a>.</p><p>The challenge, as always, is between keeping things simple and getting complicated (or never being able to please everyone). Your shown your ability to walk that line, of course. :-) Thanks again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the kind words. I've found that the apps I appreciate the most are the ones I need myself - and this is one I definitely need.</p><p>Kyle Hayes is also definitely to thank. He really improved the UI and was a big help.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Simon, I added that one (and Ray's) to my resource list. (I welcome people sharing with me more resources to list. There's a link to do that on each of the 40+ categories.)</p></div>
