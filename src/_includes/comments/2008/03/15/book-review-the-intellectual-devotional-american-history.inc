		<div class="comment_text"><p>My adult son is somewhat mentally limited but can read. I got him the first, general Intel. Devotional for Christmas. He's really enjoyed telling me daily about his Devotional. Today he summarized "Medieval Philosophy" and he had a lot of info I didn't know. Great book! This one covers seven fields of knowledge, one for each day.</p><p>Morning talk show guy here in Philadelphia reads on each morning on his show.</p></div>
