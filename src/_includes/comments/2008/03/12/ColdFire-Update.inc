		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am going to update to the newest rev of ColdFire.  Do you think there is the need to uninstall the 1.003 version of the extension first and then install the latest build?</p><p>Also, is this version compatible with Firefox 3?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - Thanks for letting me be part of the best ColdFusion debugger around! I have to say it is quite an honor.</p><p>@Terry - Thanks for the kind words.</p><p>@Michael - If you are looking for Firefox 3 support you may want to hold off on the update for a couple of days. We hope to have a new version out which will work with Firefox 3 in the next week or so.</p></div>
