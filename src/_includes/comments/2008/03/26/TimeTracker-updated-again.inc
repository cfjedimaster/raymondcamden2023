		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, for those of us who got an earlier version of the app, can you tell us if getting the updated version would keep the previous data, or not?</p><p>I have the version from about Mar 24. I'm not finding any means by which to find previously entered hours, which is a bummer. I can't tell if they got added. I even added some more, and still don't see them. I only have hours, clients, and projects tab. Is there something I may be missing?</p><p>Or if I do update to the latest version (what you last blogged on 3/26), will I at least not lose whatever I *have* added? Thanks in advance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, but that's the thing. (You said, "I'd recommend re-entering the data.") I don't see how to view what data I have entered. I just assumed there's be some way (which may seem a mistake on my part to start entering data before confirming that, but really, I have to think I'm just missing something.)</p><p>So to be clear, I'm not asking for a mechanism to "backup the data". I hear you saying you'll add that in the future. I'm asking how simply to view what I have entered.</p><p>Or more simply, if I apply an updated version, will that pickup the previously entered data? Or if you just don't know, where would I find the data? I looked through the files in C:\Program Files\TimeTracker and didn't see anything obvious as a database. Is it elsewhere? Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm, what I meant was - except for this final version I had released, I had not thought much about getting the old data. You _could_ use a SQLite manager to select * from the tables. This would then let you re-enter stuff in my application.</p><p>You ask - if you run this new version, will it pick up the old data.</p><p>In theory - yes. I am using the same file name I used from the very beginning. As tables have changed I've told people to kill the old install, but the tables haven't changed for a while, so in theory, you should be able to just reinstall.</p><p>BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE note I have not tested this - if you have CRITICAL info in the db - and I hope not (I mean not from before I put it on RIAForge), then you want to find the db first.</p><p>As for finding the file, look for data.db. I'm not sure where Windows/AIR will lay that down, but when you find the results, you want to look for a folder named TimeTracker.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, again, my first question was not about extracting data: just about viewing it within the app. I'm sure you meant for us to do that. :-) But I'll let that go. I realize you have so many versions now that you may not be able to help say how to view it in the version I have.</p><p>I found the file (thanks for the filename). If it helps others, in my case (on Vista), it's in C:\Users\charlie arehart\AppData\Roaming\TimeTracker.673D3FE53725BD48A19FFA91A34D61B8245C3551.1\Local Store\data.db.)</p><p>I'll back that up, apply the update, and if it can't see it, I'll open the file with some other approach to get at the old data.
