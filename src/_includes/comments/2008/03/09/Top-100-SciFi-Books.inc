		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure I'd suggest *any* of the Neal Stephenson books.  I don't much care for what I've read of the Quicksilver cycle, although I know people who do.  However, I don't know anyone who thought "The Big U" was a good book.  Thankfully, it is short.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ben, I read part of the first book of Quicksilver, and found it dense, and hard to read. I never finished it. If that is your ONLY experience with Stephenson though, I _highly_ recommend you try Snow Crash and Diamond Age.</p><p>Scott - you are the second person to recommend Tek. I may have to add that to my wish list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting list. Not sure I'd put Do Androids as Philip K Dick's best book - for me UBIK and A Scanner Darkly are better - but I guess that might have something to do with the movie tie-in. Also would have Iain M Banks a bit higher - his Culture books are excellent sci-fi.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of my all-time favourites books (well, the trilogy) is the Jon Shannow novels, by David Gemmell. Although not entirely sci-fi, they are a must read for fantasy novel readers.</p><p>A fantastic trilogy, set in the future, basically about a world after an apocalypse, when the world turned on it's axis. Superb characters, great storylines, and some imagery that is just mind-blowing. I've read the trilogu twice now, and am aiming for my third session soon.</p><p>You have to check it out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anyone catch this? I found this release this morning. It’s by NY Times best-selling author Steve Alten and it’s from his new book called Hell’s Aquarium.<br>ACTRESS LANA WOOD ATTACKED BY 70 FOOT SHARK<br>Hollywood actress Lana Wood, who once played Plenty O’Toole opposite Sean Connery in the James Bond movie, Diamonds Are Forever, was attacked by what eyewitnesses say was a Megalodon, a 70-foot, 70,000 pound prehistoric cousin of the Great White shark. The attack occurred in the waters off the coast of Monterey, California. . .in the pages of New York Times best-selling author Steve Alten’s new release MEG: Hell’s Aquarium. <br>           Lana Wood, a former Playboy centerfold, has an extensive career in the movies, and wrote a best-selling memoir about her late sister, actress Natalie Wood, back in 1986. She contacted Steve Alten a year ago and asked him to make her a character in his new MEG book, the fourth and best story in the series.<br>            Lana Wood will be appearing at Comicon in San Diego July 16th – 19th  as a featured guest in a special area that will house the "Women of James Bond." George Lazenby, who played 007 in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” will also be appearing. Lana says she will offer free autographs to anyone showing up with a copy of MEG: Hell’s Aquarium.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of my favorite series to this day (in fact I've been meaning to re-read it) is the Myst series.  there are three books and they are written by the brother that wrote the Myst video games.  The books don't neccisarily have anything to do with the games but if you are a fan of the games it'll make it that much better.<br>They have really good character and pretty maazing stories and help gain a better insight to the dni characters.</p></div>
