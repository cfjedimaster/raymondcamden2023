		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond, this is a very old article not sure if what you said still apply today?  There is no limit on my host but I want to avoid being marked as spammer by throttling the emails being sent to 250/hours spread out during the day.  Is there a different way of doing this with newer CF today?   Does it matter if we send 10K in one shot?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Maybe I don't understand you - but I literally explained how to do code it in CF. Or do you mean avoiding the CF Admin? I believe recent CF servers let you define scheduled tasks from code. You could also use a third party service to setup a scheduled HTTP call to your CFM.</p></div>
