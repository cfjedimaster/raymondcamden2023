		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have never understand why  the license is 1 or 2 CPU's on one machine?  If I had a server with 4 CPU's on it why should I have to buy another license?  What would I do buy the license and set it on the shelf with the other box?</p><p>-Randy</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great timing on this, as my work just bought a blade server and all our web servers will be VMs soon. On top of that, we're about to get another CF server. I'll recommend upgrading to Enterprise, having the one license, and then I get the benefits of the Enterprise edition. ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>yep...just like Windows licensing, along with SQL Server and other enterprise products. They need to be licensed according to the CPU count. Although with virtualisation you can restrict the number of CPUs available to the VM itself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another twist...What if you have a server w/ 2 physical CPUs that is used to host two VMs, each with a different OS, that will each be running CF.  Would you need to purchase two enterprise licenses, or could you skate by with one?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In a virtualised environment you can take advantage of the cores per socket feature and  nominate the number of cores per vCPU. This allows you to treat the vCPU as a core. I.E in an 8VCPU environment, using the cores per socket method you can actually make them appear as 2VCPU with each vCPU having 4 cores.<br>See the following kb article from vmware. It'll break it down for you <br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkb.vmware.com%2Fselfservice%2Fmicrosites%2Fsearch.do%3Flanguage%3Den_US%26cmd%3DdisplayKC%26externalId%3D1010184%3AcAdarc7UeoSaS9Blnr0-havhAKs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1010184">http://kb.vmware.com/selfse...</a><br>or google "cpuid.coresPerSocket".</p></div>
