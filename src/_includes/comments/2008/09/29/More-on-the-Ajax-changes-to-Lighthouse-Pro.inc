		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I must say that I've actually never thought LHP to be slow. Our bugdatabase has been steadily growing and even with 400+ bugs it never felt slow at any time. Maybe it is my client that is too "fat" or my browser that is too "fast" (Opera), but I've actually never experienced the slowing down that you describe.</p><p>Anyways, hope that the "new-and-improved" LHP will bring more fun and ease to the daily chores. I'll wait with an install until you're out of beta - production machines aren't allowed to run beta software ;-)</p><p>I'll give it a go on my own laptop though ;-) So I can test the transition from old to new.</p></div>
