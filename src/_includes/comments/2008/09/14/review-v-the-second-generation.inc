		<div class="comment_text"><p>Scott, that (the SciFi movie comparison) is a perfect example. Although I think SciFi probably could not have done it as bad as this book. Close - but not quite.</p><p>What makes this even more sad for me is that I just finished reading a wonderful series of books (Song of Ice and Fire). As much as I enjoyed it, I was looking forward to something a bit different and this was a huge letdown.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>And who can forget Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger fame) as the bumbling, nice-guy alien helping the resistance. Or Michael Ironside as the hard-ass resistance tuff guy.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray. I bought the book a month or so ago but then I got in a large order from Alibris and haven't touched V yet, reading all the books I loved before but only checked out from the library, didn't own... I flipped through a couple of pages when I first got it and it seemed a bit.. off. Now I'll lower my expectations substantially before I read it.</p><p>On a similar topic -- ever read the Willow sequels?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's the one -- the author of the original story came out with a sequel trilogy of books, taking place many years after the movie. Shadow Moon, Shadow Dawn, Shadow Star. Similar to the V book... better written I'm sure, but a bit off from the original in focus.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think they should leave off where the last episode does.</p><p>We could show that Mike &amp; Julie get married and that he has<br>his own film company and works out of his home office. Willie works for him as a helper. They soon discover through small events that some of the visitors lead by diana never left. Humnan come up missing. there is a lot more I can say but you get the idea. We could use some of<br>the characters from the origianl and that would explain why<br>they are older.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Only just seen this now (10 years later!). Very well said. I was a huge V (original series / Final Battle) fan-boy back in the 80s (loathed the cheap TV follow up though), and you can plot the graph of excitement to crushing disappointment for reading this book - it's a vertical line down.<br>I know exactly what you mean about wishing you hadn't read it (I only managed the first chapter of the ebook version), and the folks who feel the same way about the Star Wars prequels. <br>I feel exactly the same way about Prometheus - I *love* the film Alien (still do); the mystery and majesty of that ship and that weird alien relic at the start of the movie are just incredible - and boy did they ruin it by making those same aliens a bunch of Mad Max rejects from a bad Duran Duran video.</p></div>
