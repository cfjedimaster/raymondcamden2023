		<div class="comment_text"><p>These updates look great! I've been using lighthouse already for some really large projects over the past 5-6 months and it's been a life saver.</p><p>There was a couple of things I wound up tinkering. I disabled emails because my group was in lighthouse almost everyday and the quantity of emails was too great. I flipped the ordering of notes so the most recent was on top, and made the issue text area a giant fckeditor window so we could do things like past email content with lists and links.</p></div>

(I'm actually using JQuery to fetch, parse and display RSS feeds instead of cffeed)</p><p>I've often needed to add lists to bug reports. Using an asterisk as a bullet point is not ideal.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@JC: Bug confirmed, and fixed, and I replaced the download.</p><p>I respectfully want to disagree with your 'scattered' approach. All of my apps have used this system for years now: An install folder with full installation instructions, and a readme.txt file that explains changes from one version to another. Because this is the beta, I used the readme to explain what to do for the update. There will be a full 'upgrade' doc when I release the final version. Although the readme will still be there for folks who are curious.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey,</p><p>  We're currently using Trac, mainly for the SVN integration. We'd like to do away entirely with the Python dependency on our beta/testing/bug tracking server.</p><p>There isn't a whole lot of documentation to be found on Lighthouse, though. Are there any plans to integrate with an SVN platform? Or does this already exist? Know of anyone working on it?</p><p>It's nice to say 'bug #344 closed with svn commits #1043, #1045 by user X,Y' With a direct copy of the code changed.</p><p>Should be fairly easy to do in Java. If it's not available, perhaps I can attempt to tackle it ?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I've given some thought to this before. In theory you just need a SVN postcommit hook to send the data to a CFM that would accept it. The issue I have is authentication - you would have to trust the URL request from SVN.</p><p>So I've "thought" about it, but haven't tackled it. I'd _gladly_ look at any submission you may have in this area.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray.<br>  This might get a little long, so I am hoping to perhaps communicate with you about this perhaps via email.</p><p>  I am willing to take on the issue, but am in the discovery phase. There are many alternatives to URL based SVN integration. There are a few Java libraries that provide complete solutions for integrating with SVN servers. The ones I am thinking about aren't JRE standard, though. So installing Lighthouse with SVN would require either an additional script, or  user interaction.</p><p>There is also interaction via command line. This requires that we have a bin copy of SVN available to the module. If this module is above the web root... without some sort of protection it could prove very insecure.</p><p>Then, of course, there is URL interaction. If the Repository is initially setup by an admin with each user having a unique user name and password... it should be fairly secure?</p><p>I have used the second two methods before, in various ways. Once we had an outsourced team work on a 'beta' copy. We had a url available to them that would allow them to push that committed code to trunk which would be the beta site and then another script to push the approved changes to the production server.</p><p>The second way is how all of our developers interact with SVN. We haven't had many issues with it and this is how we have trac set up. Trac merely keeps a text copy of the changes instead of attempting to query the SVN server each time you would like to see change #X. This might be the most advisable way to do it ? We would just need to setup an SVN specific table that stores change X to issue Y to posting user Z.</p><p>Plenty more to talk about, but I would like to hear your concerns about URL based integration. I am thinking about taking it on this weekend, although it will probably take a bit longer to complete and be test worthy.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, in theory, LHP could generate a project key, a unique value, let's say it's N but imagine its a nice long UUID. Your SVN post commit hook could then simply be to hit</p><p>LHPInstallroot/hookprocess.cfm?key=N</p><p>If the "key" gets out, then you are screwed, but we could provide a simple way to generate a new key per project. As it stands, I doubt many people use LHP on a publicly accessible site anyway.</p></div>
