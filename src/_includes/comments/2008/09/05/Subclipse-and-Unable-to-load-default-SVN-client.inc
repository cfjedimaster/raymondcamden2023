		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Bliss,</p><p>Oooh SVN in Dreamweaver - superb. I've always loved DW - using it since V1.01 but moved to Eclipse for CF work last year.. I still go back to it for working with ASP though and do like it's feel.<br>SVN support is a great addition. I don't think I'll switch from Eclipse just yet (I have become dependent on the different workspace feature and the ability to have multiple editor windows open - each one holding it's own set of files).</p></div>

And to be honest, as much as I give DW a hard time, the new version has some wicked cool features in it. Wicked cool. One example - you can move all inline JS, even event handlers, into external scripts with one button click. That's just one new feature. I'm considering getting more familiar with DW (once the new one is final) just so I can use tools like that from time to time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also, to be fair to the Eclipse developers, the problems people have are almost universally problems with plugins, not with Eclipse itself. If there is a problem with a plugin, the blame for that really lies with the plugin developer not Eclipse.</p><p>Case in point are the CF Eclipse plugins. If RDS doesn't work, that's Adobe's fault, not the Eclipse Foundation's. I mean, builds of 3.4 were available for many months before it was officially released.</p><p>It's up to the plugin developers to test things and update them as necessary, since clearly there is no way the Eclipse folks themselves can possibly test every combination of platform, JRE, and plugin set. Many times the issue is even a conflict between plugins.</p><p>The same thing happens to Microsoft. Sure they've done some stupid things and written crappy code in their time, but a huge number of Windows issues are actually driver bugs, or conflicts between a particular set of drivers running together. But if something crashes, people instantly point the finger at Microsoft even though chances are good that they actually had nothing to do with it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I switched to the Subversive plugin for SVN after fighting with Subclipse one day. I mostly like it better than Subclipse. It ties in pretty nicely with Mylyn and seems to be destined to be a default feature of Eclipse at some point. It does a weird thing though when you are doing a checkin and want to compare a file from the checkin dialog to the repo in that it drops it behind the window with the list of files. I've had to modify my workflow to do any compares I'm not sure of before I get to the commit dialog...that annoys me.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eclipse.org%2Fsubversive%2F%3AX9WVkbtO69Zciy_huNNF7e8h61o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/">http://www.eclipse.org/subv...</a></p></div>
