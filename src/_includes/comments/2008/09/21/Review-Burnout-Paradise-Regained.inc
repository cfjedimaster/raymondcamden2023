		<div class="comment_text"><p>LOL!!! I didn't know that your score was being beaten but it was indeed my son who just turned 6 who was kicking your butt! He also loves to do the one where you roll around after a crash trying to smash as much stuff as possible and he has had a few times where I couldn't believe his score (I can't beat him). I love that game and so does he. One of these days I will race you online, but I don't promise to be as good at it as my son.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I kind of miss some of the features that Revenge had, although the crashing now is more fun (because you can string the crash so much farther). The only real complaints I had were that a) you can't restart a race easily and b) I'm not very good. :)</p><p>I'm also not an online competitor - I rarely get any online achievements just because I really don't care to be crushed by people I don't know - and I do like the friends-list high score feature ...</p><p>I rented this through GameFly, but it was closer to release, before the updates came out. I haven't rented it since, although I should probably put it back on my list. I don't know how much playing time it will get now that Rock Band 2 is here ...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I bought a pre-rented copy from GameFly for just under $20 a couple months back.  I just checked &amp; the 360 version's still available for about the same price.  PS3 version's a couple bucks more.</p><p>I'm amazed that Criterion's been willing &amp; able to release so much post-release add-on content, especially when you consider that they're owned by EA, one of the worst content gougers around (paying to unlock content already on the disc is a pet peeve of mine).</p><p>I'm also looking forward to WipEout HD being released on PSN later this week.  I'll be curious to see if/when they'll add new content in the future; if they do, I'm not counting on it being free.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary Funk bought me FU from my wishlist. It _just_ arrived today. I've been suffering with some bad headaches lately (really bad), so I'm not sure I'll play tonight - but I'll try to soon. It will definitely be the next game I review though. I loved the demo (although I found the 'hit this button quick/DDR' part a bit dumb.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy @Ray - SW:FU is a lot of fun but its totally a God of War clone (thus the stupid push this button at the right time challenges...which so far have been pretty easy and totally unnecessary). I have also had camera issues in a number of places...some that made portions nearly unplayable (and usually ended in me being killed somewhere offscreen out of view of the camera). The environments and story are top-notch and their is nothing more fun than flinging a Storm Trooper with your force powers. (not to write your review for you Ray ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My only concern is this. When I played Jedi Knight (way back when I did PC games), I found that I could win every single fight by simply picking up a trooper and dropping them off a cliff. Being a FPS, there were quite a few cliffs. This was fun at first, then quickly made the game a bit boring. "Run in room. Pick up. Drop. Repeat. Leave room." I hope TFU isn't that easy. ;) I tried it in the demo and it wasn't quite so simple.</p><p>As for the story - I got TFU art book, and what I saw amazed me. So much so that I didn't actually read anything so I wouldn't spoil myself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray<br>I played that game quite a bit too (that was before I abandonned the Alienware in favor of consoles).  Anyway, this game is a bit different.  You're pretty much getting bombarded all of the time so if you want to try to do the force grip to long way down technique on everyone then you'll get killed very quickly as all of the other enemies will rush you, missle fire, or sniper you to death while you're doing the grab/drop on everyone.  Don't worry - you'll like this game - a lot.<br>@Brian<br>You are wrong - frying people (just like the nasty-mean emperor) is the best kill!  LOL  - not to mention the almost 3 dozen lightsaber/force trick combos you can learn.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I love this game! I played it almost non-stop to the end when I got the game begin '08 for the PS3. The bike pack is cool, but I can't wait to race on the island. If you check the criterion website, you can see a few screen shots of the new island and some videos about developing the game, pretty cool stuff!</p></div>
