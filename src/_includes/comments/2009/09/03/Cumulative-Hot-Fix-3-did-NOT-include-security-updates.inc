		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, cumulative suggests "everything up until now", so that is a bit misleading. Your webservice idea is an excellent idea, I hope you put that on the wishlist.</p><p>BTW, did you see the bit about this update fixing a possible mem leak?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Please bug Adobe"......</p><p>Can you describe the best way to do that?  I've used their support area....which pretty much sucks.  There's never a subject choice even remotely like my question.  And, about a week later, I get a pdf from them that says "see below for resolution".  The only thing on my pdf is my original question.  Leads me to believe that my support question simply timed out somehow and they never looked at it.</p><p>Oh, and you can't reply to the nice "resolution" emails.  You have to use the support area.  And, guess what, there's no subject choice like "you didn't answer my question".  Or "wtf", I'd settle for that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, there are plenty of Adobe people on Twitter, and on blogs. I don't mean to imply to _bug_ them per se, but you can definitely reach out to those CFers in the community.</p></div>
