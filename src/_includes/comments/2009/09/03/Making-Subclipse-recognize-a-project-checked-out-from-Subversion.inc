		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, what OS are you on?  Most of the time I check my projects out using TortoiseSVN in window (both XP and Vista), and subversion picks them up just fine in eclipse... now, I'm at version 3.5 of eclipse, but this worked in version 3.4 as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Maybe it's a funky permission issue?  There's not really much to an .svn folder, is there?  They all pretty much can stand alone, right?  And subversion doesn't do anything different than a commandline or shell client would do... anyway, weird permission issue is getting my vote ;).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,<br>ok, it's a bit late. I just had the same issue and found your post while googling. I tried your solution. Was pretty nervous since it's a huge repository and hundreds of people work with it, plus my weekend is supposed to start soon. So, apparently Subclipse has been improved. It popped up a dialog box telling me that the project was already in Subversion and asked wether it should just connect my working copy to the repository. Yay! I still don't get why this has to be hidden in the Import workflow.</p></div>
