		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the same thing happen with 2 of my 3 360s as well.  It was explained to me that it's the DVD player that scratches some of the discs.  MS was excellent about replacing the xbox each time, but still a PITA because the discs won't work on any machine eventually.  I would suggest laying the box horizontally if it's not already.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll say a prayer for your 360, but as I mentioned over IM, you are likely heading down the slow road towards a RRoD.</p><p>I know it hurts to think about it, but you should probably wrap a towel around your 360 and let nature take it course. Don't worry, your 360 won't feel much pain and this is really for the best. You'll save it from suffering and if you act sooner than later you'll get it back before the holiday release season is over (CoD4:MW2).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll let folks know what MS Support says. FYI, Sacred2 worked for me last night - for a good 4 hours until I myself crashed, and the game kicks ass. Very good Diablo clone, and a good sense of humour. (Some NPCs will die and bemoan having 'bit' parts.)</p><p>And James - Saints Rows 2 is _very_ well done. I've always found GTA to be a bit too complex. Sure, it has a good story, but I found the control scheme to be a bit much.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just another confirmation - this is definitely a precursor to the RRoD state... had it happen twice to me already.</p><p>The PITA part is that you're not eligible for the extended warranty unless it actually shows the RRoD... merely overheating and locking up within minutes of playing any game isn't considered sufficient evidence of faulty hardware, sigh.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, I have the same problem. Let me explain a bit..</p><p>I can play games like NHL (08-10), Fable2, Crackdown etc. for hours without a crash. Then, when I insert BIGS2 it crashes after logos when the LOADING screen comes. Rock Band: Beatles always crashes somewhere between movie-start menu (never got past start menu) and Ninety-nine Nights also crashes at start menu.</p><p>I tried clearing the cache, reseting factory defaults, without HD, formating HD, without signing in to any profile, logged to live... those games still freeze the box.</p><p>To be specific with the freeze: The pic freezes to screen, get some music/sound loop which is currently playing for about 2-5secs and then complete silence -&gt; xbox only responds to poweroff (from console, controller doesn't work) and 'open tray' (closing it again doesn't change anything). Turning off the controller and turning it back on gives flashing green lights (trying to connect to box I guess).</p><p>I googled for hours and found some users with same problems and they said that they started to experience those problems after the new Dashboard update. Someone even stated that he sent his XBOX to MS and after MS returned it, it had the old dashboard and the game (Tiger woods golf IIRC) worked fine... UNTIL he updated the dashboard and the problems began again.</p><p>Any way to downgrade the console back to old dashboard? :(</p></div>
