		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be clear: they canned Jason Delmore, then replaced him with Adam?  No offense to Adam. He's awesome, and he'll do the community quite well I'm sure. But I don't understand replacing the PM with the evangelist, whose shoes will obviously need to be filled as well. It's one thing if it's a case of JD just not getting the job done. That's life. But it was done under the premise of the Adobe 600, so...</p><p>I'm sure there are good reasons for all this. I wish there were more transparency.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@wuss, as for his shoes "needing to be filled", are you aware that Terry Ryan (of the "Aarrggghh!! blog at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnumtopia.com%3ANTKJOlIbIPAnBgw5S-vxgRu6T60&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="numtopia.com">numtopia.com</a>, and more recently <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fterrenceryan.com%3Aarh2qyJx1qfdtaSq5N4eWLIT0wE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="terrenceryan.com">terrenceryan.com</a>) was recently hired? I don't know if this was to directly fill Adam's shoes, but the timing seems relevant.</p><p>I was glad to see the CF community not get into too much of a panic when Jason was among those laid off, though of course it was a bummer. Let's not now raise any suspicions over the role's being filled :-), but instead wish Adam the best in the job.</p></div>
