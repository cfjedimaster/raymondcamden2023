		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree -- it was a decent adaptation.  It wasn't perfect, but I thought it did a good job summarizing a long book.  However, I'd argue that the hormone stuff needed to be left in, because without it the entire film would have been dreary and depressing.  While that may have been the overarching theme of the book (like Empire Strikes Back), that wasn't all of it.  And, really, none of the hook-ups in Hallows would make any sort of sense if they didn't set them up here.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree it was very entertaining, it made both laugh and shiver.. The only thing for me was, it felt a lot different from the feelings I had reading the book, a LOT... But that's how movie adaptations go sometimes, I suppose :).  I also think the script spent too much time on personal problems of the main characters, leaving the real problems (Voldemort and the Horcruxes, anyone? :) a little aside..<br>That's just my pov, anyway, and I agree that it was absolutely fun to watch.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was good. But cutting out the Gaunts completely is an epic failure of story telling when the series is viewed as a whole (if they decide to now show it in the next part).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My son wanted me to reiterate how much we missed the battle at the end.</p><p>That being said, HBP was my least favorite of the books so surprisingly I felt it was the best of the movies so far especially after being disappointed by the 5th movie.</p><p>Slughorn felt very one dimensional in the book but Broadbent was the high point of the movie along with Helen Bonham Carter as Bellatrix.  I also appreciated how true to life the Lavender Brown affair was portrayed.</p><p>I will probably go see the movie again with my kids.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OH MY GOD. The movie was completely terrible, hard to pick up at the start, you can SEE a lot was cut out of the movie. WHERE THE HELL IS THE STORY LINE, HMMM? And what about the ending? Wasn't it amazing...ly horrible!! <br>I'm sorry, but it is one of the worst movies I have seen in years, certainly the worst out of the Harry Potter series. Compare the first three movies to this one - the sixth has no feeling, no meaning whatsoever. What was the point of all that love shit? That's what three quarters of the movie was revolving around.</p><p>Oh well, I guess as the writer JK Rowling has to be going somewhere with this. I'll trust her and see what happens in the seventh film, it had better be good!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I liked it. I do think cutting out Tom Riddle's pass as much as they did was a mistake. The teen hormone theme, while at first was annoying me, ended up amusing me. It was pretty funny. a little heavy handed, though</p><p>the sequence with the good luck potion was laugh out loud funny.</p><p>spoiler......<br>............................</p><p>One thing the left out and I can't for the life of me figure out why is at the very end when harry goes after snape, in the book, snape snarls at him something like "if you don't learn to control your mind you'll never ... ". I remember it feeding nicely into the "which side is snape really on?". It was both a taunt and a teaching moment.</p><p>The reveal of who the half blood prince was was also just thrown in at the end without any real impact.</p><p>overall, loved it. It was also may favorite of the books</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I liked the movie but I can't believe they didn't stage the battle at the end.  That part of the book was so good with Harry and classmates fighting the death eaters.  Also they didn't develop Snape being the half blood prince very well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My family and I watched the movie last night and we were all pretty disappointed.  We're avid fans and have read all the books of course and love the books and the previous 5 movies.  We did not enjoy this one at all.  We're still talking about what disappointed us which is quite a bit.  Big book to compress into 153 minutes but obviously what the people who adapted it for cinema thought were important differed from us.  The title Half Blood Prince indicates some importance on who or what that person could be but the movie didn't impart that for me.  Lots of really great stuff sacrificed and I have to admit we struggled to remain in the theatre because it was long, boring and we came out thinking what was that all about.  Honestly Deatheaters storming through Hogwarts unchallenged - come on!  Harry not being disciplined by Snape for nearly killing Draco - completely out of character with their relationship throughout the series.  Anyway, love the book and yup looking forward to Deathly Hallows mark I and II but probably with a bit more trepidation than before.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>HP 3D.  What a rip-off.  I don't know about the rest of you, but if you paid money to see the half-blood prince in 3D, then you probably felt cheated as well.  They let you see all the previews in 3D and then the first 20 minutes are awesome.  once Harry arrives at the Burrow, that's it.  no more 3D for the rest of the entire movie.  WHAT THE @#$^.   I paid money to see the movie in 3D, not just 20 minutes.  At least during some of the action scenes, let us put the glasses back on.  the movie was ok, but it sucked when i was expecting to see the movie in 3D from start to finish.  if they are going to advertise a movie in 3D, I say DO THE WHOLE STICKIN' THING!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>O.k to begin, in the begining when Dumbledore was making his yearly announcements you SAW! 2 aurors pacing outside the great hall. This SHOWS that Hogwarts was being protected. to have Bellatrix just come in there and tear up the place is outrageous, where was Hagrid? where was proffesor McGonagall? where were the aurors!!? There was no way in hell that after Dumbledores death security jus vanished!</p><p>To me it seemed like Yates felt like he had to compete with Twilight and New Moon. He put so much emphasis on the teen relationships and not the story line. Yates come on man Harry vs Edward? Harry wins everytime we established that when Cedric Diggory Died. kudos to hp4 AMAZING MOVIE.</p><p>At the end i think it was appropriate to have Dumbledores funeral with past characters. He could of played around with it so much like having fleur and Bill standing next to each other with engagement rings. Krum returning and his academy to pay his respects.and etc.</p><p>I understand he took out the battle to anticipate the one in hp8 but that added scene was so dirty. The plot was so messy to that scene, and again the end when they are escaping did not make sense.</p><p>Yates im sorry but if i wasnt a die hard fan i would say you nearly massacred the book with that movie. and this was my favorite book. If it wasnt for the great acting of the stars and the side plots this movie would have been a mess.</p></div>
