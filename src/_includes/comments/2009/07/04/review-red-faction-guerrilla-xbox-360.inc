		<div class="comment_text"><p>We're going to have to hookup for Multiplayer, even if it is Custom Matches. You're going to LOVE the variety of weapons and back packs. You think bringing down a tower with guards is fun? Wait until you take out the sniper tower the other team has been camping in and then Hammering them to death. MUWAH AH AH.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dana, will you please go tell them I said hi, and thanks for the fun game?</p><p>I finished it last night. Very satisfying. I'm happy the game lets you continue on - although I wish it had a 'reset buildings' option.</p></div>
