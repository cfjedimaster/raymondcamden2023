		<div class="comment_text"><p>Why does Adobe use PHP? That comes up a lot. :) While Adobe is the creator of CF, it doesn't mean everyone there knows it, and that PHP isn't an acceptable solution at times when they need a quick web site up. I'd love to see CF everywhere of course, but I wouldn't give Adobe too hard of a big time on this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond said "While Adobe is the creator of CF" I'd argue they are the maintainer of CF. :) Seriously though, I do think that plays a part. If Adobe had actually created CF originally, they'd be more of an emphasis on using the technology across the board.</p><p>However, Adobe's a big company with lots of different branches and their going to use the technology that makes sense at the time. Heck, Microsoft has used CF on portions of their site and you'd think they'd force the use of only ASP-based technologies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was a great surprise to see portlet support in CF 9. I'm eager to see how it works. I've been working with an awesome open source portal server called Liferay, <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%3Aq1U4ELlfnpDRlnyNrw3ZOPXZMKk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.liferay.com">http://www.liferay.com</a> . It has an amazing application stack and to be able to use CF with it is awesome! Thanks Adobe!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Steve</p><p>Why does Adobe us PHP? Why does Microsoft use Flash, why does any company use other technologies.</p><p>To get the job done, it's not always worth reinventing the wheel, if there is something good out there use it.</p><p>Adobe could write all sorts of things in ColdFusion, like JIRA, SharePoint etc, etc, but these things exist and are established. It would be a waste of time and money, and they have better things to spend their time and money on.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, Adobe didn't originally have CF.  They bought CF from Macromedia.  So I bet all the PHP code is because the site was created prior to the owning of CF.  Plus, I agree with Dale to certain degree; 'to get the job done'...</p></div>
