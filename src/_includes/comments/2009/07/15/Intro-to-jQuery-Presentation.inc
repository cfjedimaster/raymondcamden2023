		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for this Ray.  I was there last night and everyone at the CT usergroup was really impressed.  jQuery really makes ajax and animations easy.  The easy at which we can start using jQuery with ColdFusion is very impressive.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>jQuery's some good stuff! I was at the Saturday session of your presentation on CF 8 Ajax. Just when I was about to start using it on some projects, I found out our department's file server doesn't allow the ColdFusion server access to all the necessary CF 8 JavaScript files. Bummer! jQuery makes for a nice replacement cause it's lightweight to download and just so powerful. Keep up the good work, Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used Spry before I switched to jQuery. I have a _lot_ of respect for Spry. For those who are new to JavaScript, or perhaps have no experience, Spry is a MUCH easier framework to get into. I also think it handles "Get data/display data" the best out of all the frameworks I've seen.</p><p>That being said - as I got more experience and felt more comfortable with jQuery, I found it to be a better framework for my development.</p></div>
