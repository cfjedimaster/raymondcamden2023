		<div class="comment_text"><p>Elliott, no, you are not alone in this. I don't think Flex is quite as simple as it used to be. Is it _too_ complex? I don't think so. But I'm not sure how I'd feel if I was a brand new user. My understanding, and I could be wrong, is that the mx namespace (Halo I believe), represents the Flex 1-3 framework, and is there mainly for backwards compat, and going forward, you could just work with 2 namespaces. If so, I don't think it's quite that bad, especially since one is just for declarations (script, style, bindings) and one for UI. That's my feeling now anyway. I need to find more time to play with it and really begin to digest how things have changed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can - but to be honest, it won't be that exciting. The only difference (outside of some of the root XML) would be in setting the full URL to the CFC as opposed to just a dot path. Actually if I remember right it's still a dot path but you define the root elsewhere. Ok, so maybe it is worth doing just to remind myself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to know how the cf return data is stored in flex. Is it a collection of some sort? I would like to apply the filter functions to the returned data. Right now my database is bound to a tilelist via coldfusion and I would like to be able to sort this by date. Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks<br>Jeff</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The data stored in Flex is based on the data sent back - so an array sent via CF will be different than a struct. Not sure of the exact types myself - but you can obviously use the debugger to introspect.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you for getting back to me Ray. Another concern of mine, assuming that flex does store the return data as a collection and it is possible to use filterfunctions, is if filtering will work with data paging. The list I bind the data to has paging enabled, downloading only 20 entries at a time. I wonder if the filterfunctions will only work on those 20 entries.</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p><p>Jeff</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My understanding - and PLEASE take this with a grain of salt: Filtering will ONLY work on the data returned. So if you want to filter against the entire dataset, you have to do it client side.</p></div>
