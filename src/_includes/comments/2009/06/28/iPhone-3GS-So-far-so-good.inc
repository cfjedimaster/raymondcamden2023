		<div class="comment_text"><p>My favorite feature by far is voice command/dial. It's extremely accurate and, since it also works off the headset button, lets me call anyone I want without even pulling my phone from my pocket.</p><p>Just in case you missed it, the 3GS also works with the new headset and in-ear headphones that have volume controls built into the microphone section.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Michael for pointing this out - I forgot to mention it in my review. Unfortunately, voice dial is a complete failure for me. It has yet to recognize one name correctly yet. :(</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, there's a program on the Mac called "Image Capture". (Do a Spotlight search.)</p><p>Run it and plug in the iPhone and it should show up as a browsable device.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ML: Sorry, I should have been clearer. I have iPhone. I can use it. It just surprised me that when I clicked on Movies in iTunes, under my device, that it wasn't there. I guess it treats the 'ipod' area as different. Since I use iTunes as the main program for interacting with the iPhone, it would be nice if I could use _only_ that at times.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Like I said, this let you bypass iPhoto to get at movies on the phone. As an added bonus, it pulls them off at full resolution, unlike emailing them or posting them to YouTube.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah but iPhoto too let's me do that. Not sure why I'd use that if I have iPhoto. It gives me the full resolution as well. Again - my real point was - it would be kind of cool if _one_ tool did everything for the iPhone. I'd expect that of iTunes.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wolf3D is really addictive, if you loved the PC game you'll love this one. You need to tweak the controls a bit to really feel 'at home', but they've done an impressive job with this (basically, you can move controls and status panels all over the place :)</p></div>
