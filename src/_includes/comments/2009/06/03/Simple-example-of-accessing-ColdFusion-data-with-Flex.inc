		<div class="comment_text"><p>hey ray, possibly Susan already had this going, but it might be worth mentioning that you'll need to modify services-config.xml in your CF install to specify the servername and server port.</p><p>there are a number of articles/posts out there showing how you can set this all dynamically without the need to modify this file, but for quick and dirty getting set up, I think you need to do this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>NOTICE: Folks, you may notice "Flash Builder" in the 2nd screen shot. When I was writing the blog post, I accidentally did it in FB4 instead of FB3 for the first few steps. I had done it earlier in the week in FB3 and was running through it again for the blog entry. When I noticed this, I fixed screen shot 1, and I _thought_ screen shot 2 was the exact same UI, but I guess I was wrong. I will probably fix this later today.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Using Flash Builder 4 the generated code no longer creates a remoteobject tag.  instead it does stuff like this:</p><p>&lt;fx:Declarations&gt;<br>&lt;s:CallResponder id="getGridResult"/&gt;<br>&lt;validationfunctions:ValidationFunctions id="validationFunctions" destination="ColdFusion" endpoint="http://localhost:8500/flex2gateway/" fault="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FAlert.show%3A8ySVNM2AAGzwn9vL5mu_ToewhBk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Alert.show">Alert.show</a>(event.fault.faultString)" showBusyCursor="true" source="PTS-debug.cfc.validationFunctions"/&gt;</p><p>This radically reduces code and seems easier than the previous remoteobject tag model.</p><p>BUT...  I can't figure out how to get access in actionscript to a returned string.  All the functions that bind to a control work fine.  However, I'm trying to access a string in actionscript generated in my cfc.</p><p>My component looks like this:<br>&lt;cfcomponent&gt;<br> &lt;cffunction "returnAString" access="remote" returntype="string"&gt;<br>  &lt;cfreturn "Heres the string"&gt;<br> &lt;/cffunction&gt;<br>&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;</p><p>I can't figure out how to get at the cfreturn result in actionscript</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,<br>Thanks for the reply.  I looked at your game example, you use spring.  I was just after a quick, plain Flex, CF, Blazeds example.  Just something like a maintence form for the artists table.  Using consumer and producer.  I want to put together a proof of concept for my manager.  I don't have the time to learn spring or any other bridge.  I went to a number of Adobe events and the reps always show this and say how easy it is.  But there are never any examples.<br>As for Ben not replying.  He is the senior Adobe Evengelist.  I would think it is his job to reply to concern like I have.  We have an environment where there are daily posts about CF is dead and the like.  When Adobe does not even supply examples using their technology, I believe this only inflames the problem.</p><p>Ken</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ken: I know Ben, like me, tries to reply. But responding to email is his secondary role after heading up the Evangelists @ Adobe. I really think you need to cut him some slack. At the end of the day, if you NEED to get help on something, your only 100% sure way is Adobe support (which is paid).</p><p>@Craig: Sorry - no idea. I was planning on doing the FB4 version today. If I had to guess, the object, validationfunctions, is roughly the same as your RemoteObject, but it is named oddly.</p></div>
