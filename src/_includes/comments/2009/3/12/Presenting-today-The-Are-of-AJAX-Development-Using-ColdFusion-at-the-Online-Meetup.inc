		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray I won't be able to take this in "live" as my second child was borb yesterday, but I am going to catch the recording of it later on. I was wondering does your presentation just focus on CF implementations of AJAX, or does it go into more general ideas about things we could use AJAX for?</p><p>I work for a federal government agency, and we're not at CF8 and have been told that we won't be until CF9 is out. We have jQuery at our disposal, so we have a way to implement AJAX, but we struggle in coming up with things to use it for that would be worth the development costs. Anything we do will have to be doable both with or without JavaScript and must all be keyboard accessible to meet Section 508 demands.</p><p>We would love to get into this, but there's so much on our to-do lists that we have to find a reason to do it that we can sell to our government clients, we can't just do something for the sake of doing it. Does your presentation go down that path, or could you possibly help me in the idea department at all?</p><p>I plan on enjoying this for my personal growth at least, as I have CF8 and have gotten into a little bit of AJAX recently on my own, but I'm not a strong creative person.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My presentation is on CF working with AJAX - and by that I mean - what issues/benefits/etc do we get when we use CF and Ajax together. So problems like with onRequest are covered. Benefits like native JSON support. I do NOT focus on one Ajax library, but rather show a few of them in play. It is meant to be a generic: "I want to do Ajax. I use CF. What should I know?"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I watched most of the presentation today, and I really liked the format you chose with all the code.  I felt like I got a lot more out of it that a normal webex type meeting.</p></div>
