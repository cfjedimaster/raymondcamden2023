		<div class="comment_text"><p>No. I've got some personal stuff going on which has dramatically impacted my community stuff (blog posting, OS work, etc), so I need to kind of chill for a few weeks until I get stuff in order.</p><p>I _have_ been thinking about a jquery preso in my head. Kind of roughly setting it up. My main thinking is... jQuery was hard for me at first. It wasn't as friendly as Spry was. That could be _entirely_ my fault. But maybe I could do a jQuery preso specifically aimed at helping people get over the humps that I had and getting them using the framework.</p><p>Hope that makes sense.</p></div>
