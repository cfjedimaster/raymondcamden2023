I posted on your blog for the first time 2 days ago, and then I got this post and for some reason all I saw when I opened the mail was "ColdFusion Biggest Losers Club." :-) I thought I'd broken some unspoken CF blog etiquette and asked a really dumb question (well I probably did anyway).</p><p>*really* weird demo to me of the effect of context on perception, and funny how you can understand that concept well but never really think it applies to you.</p><p>OT day 2 of no nicotine, but the biscuit count is not looking good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, that's really awesome progress. I definitely need to start doing more (read: some) cardio. I was doing stair master for a 15-20 minutes a few times a week and I definitely noticed a big difference. Then, for scheduling and laziness, I stopped and have definitely put back on some weight (and feel worse).</p><p>I would like to get a treadmill as I find a fast walk to me more comfortable than than my stairmaster.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One thing about a treadmill - get a good one. Our first one was cheap. When we got a new one a while back, we went top of the line, and it made an amazing difference. I had to bump up my workout since the exercise actually got a lot easier. Also - find something to do on the treadmill. I've done DVDs and science/nature shows on TV, and find that I almost don't want to stop walking since I'm into the show. It is a great way to do a season of TV on DVD. It's how I watched Firefly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, Good pointer. I try to watch TV while I do the stairmaster, but the problem is that I can only make it through a 30 minute show that is DVR'd (about 22 minutes). But, I have lots of one hour shows on my DVR (mostly Law and Orders!!). If I had something more comfortable, I could certainly go longer. Brisk walking for 50 minutes (lowering intensity as needed) is much more feasible that 50 minutes on my stairmaster (which requires manual adjustment of legs to change intensity).</p><p>I need to get rid of my stationary bike (which I stopped using a long time ago) and my stair master and get a nice treadmill.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, a 50 minute show is a good thing Ben! I found that it made me -much- more inclined to get back on the next day so I could see how things ended. ;)</p><p>If you want a treadmill recommendation, try Solo. I had issues with them when the product arrived damaged. It took longer than I thought to get it corrected, but once fixed, it is a damn fine machine.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In total agreement for the 50 minute thing both in health and mental ability to climb back on the horse. Part of my stairmaster is not good is that it uses these hydrolic cylinders to create resistance. When you start, you are at a given intensity; but, as the oil heats up (the things get wicked hot) I assume it lowers the viscosity and the intensity goes way up (less resistance == faster movement). As such, I hit a point where it simply gets too intense to continue.</p><p>I'd love to go the 50 minutes, but would need something with a variable resistance that can easily be controlled. All good machines should have this. Mine cost $70 and acts like a $70 machine :)</p><p>Time to invest in my cardiovascular health!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One way to make exercising fun that I've found is using the Nintendo Wii. I use Wii sports about twice a week at the moment. I do the boxing for 30 minutes then tennis for about 20-30 minutes.<br>You'd be surprised at how good the work out is as long as you put maximum intensity into each move.<br>It's incredible how aggressive I can get while doing the boxing - I truly hate some of those boxy wii characters..lol.</p><p>On the remaining 3 days I do what I consider the most brutal and effective workout's I've ever used (and I've been working out regularly for about 10 years). They are part of the Bas Rutten MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) workout which was designed by Bas for traning for combat. Bas Rutten is a well known MMA athelete. They are audio only which means they never get boring and I've been doing them for about 4 years or so (sometimes inregularly but I always come back to them).</p><p>They are essentially based on Thai boxing although there is also a boxing workout and an all around workout (totally brutal circuit training based routine). The ultimate in the series is the all round fighting wokout which combines thai boxing punch / kick combos with sprawls where you have to hit the ground on all fours and then spring back up to continue the combos.. <br>Tough is an understatement and it can take months to build up to being able to handle this one.</p><p>The great thing is that they are only 30 minutes in length based around 2 or 3 minute rounds with 1 minute rest.<br>Makes it easier to fit into a routine I find, and due to the mental intensity the 30 minutes is probably equivalent to 1 - 1.5 hours of other exercising.</p><p>I can thoroughly recommend this work out if your at an intermediate to advanced level fitness wise. The 2 minute boxing rounds is a great start and you feel the results very quickly.</p><p>I intend to buy some free weights and bench soon to add into the mix. I recently switched to working out in the morning before hitting my desk to work.. It's working out a lot better than I thought and means I am able to do 5 days without problem.. Alot of this is all about finding a routine that 'fits'..</p><p>Sorry for the length of this post.. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is awesome to hear about other CF-ers getting into and/or continuing exercise. I'd like to challenge you treadmill/stairmaster/elliptical folks to add some variety every now and then. Joe alluded to it in his comment. It is the "outdoors". Go for a walk or jog or a bike ride. You might not be able to catch up on a TV series, but you can listen to a podcast, book on MP3 or even just watch the real world. The resolution is even better than 1080p.</p><p>Of course the indoor equipment does come in handy sometimes. Icy roads are not conducive to to safe exercise. I hit the treadmill just this morning for that reason.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Matt - You know, I never thought about podcasts. I don't listen to podcasts now because I work at home, but they would be perfect for an outside walk. My only problem would be finding a route. I'm sure I could find one, but I like that I can walk on my treadmill with minimal 'thought' involved (ie, no needing to worry about dodging cars).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Congrats on the weight loss and the keeping it off part.</p><p>I have lost a good 30 pounds in the last year myself.</p><p>I can relate to the obsessing about your weight thing. I do too! Heck I start panicking if I am a couple pounds over my current weight of 180. I know that a couple pound variation from day to day or even week to week is normal but it still freaks me out.</p><p>Taekwondo has been the real key for me and my weight loss. Not just the going to class and practicing part but also knowing that losing weight would improve my flexibility and quickness and in turn improve my taekwondo.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wii Fit isn't bad if you want something to break up the routine of your regular workouts. Step aerobics, yoga, balance games ... last night I unlocked a combination step-boxing thing that was pretty good. (Shadow boxing is a good workout no matter how you dress it up.)</p><p>I agree that cheap equipment tends to be cheap in all senses of the word. I bought a cheap recumbent bike several years ago; the counter/timer/whateverelse panel lasted about six months, and that was that.</p><p>I don't mind occasional outdoor exercise when the weather is conducive to it, but unfortunately around here that's about three months out of the year once you take out cold and wet weather (believe it or not, we get more precipitation than Seattle) ... it's more practical to opt for indoor exercise. Plus you have to be careful about where you go outside. If your jogging/biking path is near or alongside a highway or something like that, what you breathe in might cancel out the work you're doing ...</p></div>
