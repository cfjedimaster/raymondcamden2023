		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - the LAST person who should be worried about guilt trips and/or shameless plugs in this community, is YOU. What you do for the community, the knowledge you share, the presentations you make to user groups, without asking for anything in return - the least we could do is make a small donation to a worthy cause in your local community.</p><p>I for one will do so (I'm posting anonymously so as not to make this reply about attention to myself), and would encourage everyone else who has learned from your blog do so also. Heck, even if it's $20, something.</p></div>
