		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray. Thanks for the info and your insight. I'm experimenting with using Wave for website alert notifications and developer communications to internal users - so this post will help a lot :-)</p><p>I just hope Wave catches on - it seems ideal for push communications in the way that RSS isn't. Awful English there!</p><p>--<br>Mike</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Thanks for writting up your experiences.  As you know, being an early adoptor of beta software can be painful ;)  Thanks for sticking it out and highlighting issues we need to work on.  I agree that we need a way to list all feeds, and it's something we're working on.</p><p>And yes, what Waves does with the badge can be done by any AIR app.  AIR is pretty awesome like that!</p><p>Best,<br>John</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>You inspired me to get my adobe wave feet wet. I whipped up another CFC to handle this that people should be able to take and implement on their own fairly easily. It's only for broadcast notifications right now, but it handles the API key logic.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftextsnip.com%2F6d8a2f%3ASP6oIOgxh0k8ifDX4Cl7RC0Pg-4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://textsnip.com/6d8a2f">http://textsnip.com/6d8a2f</a></p><p>Couldn't find a better way to share this code so that's what i got!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ray: I've never posted to RIAForge before, but yea i'll definitely look into that and post  alink when it's up!</p><p>@wim: I should have clarified that. The component name will be AdobeWave, so when the cfc inits it will return itself. Also here  is a simple example of instantiating and using the cfc:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftextsnip.com%2Fd58be4%3ADn77n1qKAsSR5RnTMPdphbVtCFY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://textsnip.com/d58be4">http://textsnip.com/d58be4</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool, thanks! I'm a bit worried though about the e-mail/url<br>relationship in Adobe Wave. Does this mean that when<br>you have several domain names, you need an Adobe<br>account for each of them?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi again.<br>How did everyone find the cfhttp calls to https addresses? I may be missing something, but so far I can only seem to get "I/O Exception: peer not authenticated" errors when trying to call the API.</p><p>I can do a straight HTML Form submission (literally by creating a form and clicking submit) but the back-end automatic notification stuff seems to be beyond me! (And I've been doing this a looooong time) Perhaps it's just something I've simply not done before and everyone else does it out of habit??</p><p>Argh!<br>--<br>Mike</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Trumans1: Yes, I am. I wrote my own code and then checked it against your textsnip examples. I've checked it all twice and I can't see any reason for the code to be wrong.   I'm pretty sure it's something to do with certificates, but no-one else is having the problem...</p></div>
