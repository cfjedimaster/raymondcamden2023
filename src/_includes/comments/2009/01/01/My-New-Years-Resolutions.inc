		<div class="comment_text"><p>Beginner: Can 'speak' the language, can do basic work, can copy/paste other more advanced work with knowledge of what they are doing (ie, I would never have thought of this code, but I know it does foo)</p><p>Intermediate: Can create more complex code than the basic stuff. Begins to understand that there may be 2 ways to do X, but way #2 is faster/better/more organized. Has a good understanding of when they are writing sucky code, but may not know the best way to make it non-sucky.</p><p>Advanced: Um, all of the above. ;) I think we all get what an advanced person can do. I'm just trying to get half way there. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm reading Atlas Shrugged right now and really enjoying it.  The context is a bit contrived or over-simplified like an allegory, but it is certainly keeping my interest.  I'm 2/3 of the way through and will probably compare it to Dune (one of my all-time favorites) by the time I am done.</p><p>Atlas Shrugged certainly has many parallels to the socio-economic climate we live in today.  That is probably true of any time period and one of the reasons it remains very popular.</p><p>I had the Fountainhead checked out from the library but didn't find time to start it before Christmas.  Booklist.Queue("Fountainhead"). Good luck with it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'd love to hear a beginner's guide/comparison between Groovy and ColdFusion. From the light references scattered around blogs I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything not looking into it, so if I am I'd love to hear it from you (me meaning general ColdFusion developers that read your blog).</p><p>Groovy vs. ColdFusion deathmatch post 2009.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I’m a firm believer that big life changes come through small daily choices. It’s the habits of the daily routine that determine long term success.

It’s a completely free online daily goal tracking service. You can share your goals with friends and have them keep you accountable. I’ve found it very useful for myself, which is why I created it in the first place. Enjoy!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Whether you celebrated Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa in December we all celebrated the same thing sometime in the past 24 hours - the New Year. There are many things that we commonly associate with the New Year. Many of us, never me, choose various ways to celebrate the passing year and embrace the new one. Regardless of how you choose to celebrate, many of us choose to make resolutions. I will not venture to guess what it is exactly, but I am sure it is an incredibly poor percentage of those resolutions that actually pan out. (This site has statistics, but I question how accurate they are)</p><p>Some common resolutions range from ‘dieting’ to ‘exercising more’ to ‘quitting a bad habit.’ Some are more general like ‘make more money’ or ‘volunteer more.’ Whatever your New Year’s Resolution may be I am sure there is a reason for it. Some of you may do it at the request of a loved one or simply for personal gratification. Both of these reasons are fitting I guess.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.palles.us%3A1IdrPNFkSM9X1xsIi75Mbmz7V1w&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.palles.us">www.palles.us</a> - to continue reading</p></div>
