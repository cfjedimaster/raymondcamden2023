		<div class="comment_text"><p>Isn't Aptana an Eclipse plugin? If so, it doesn't make sense to use it "in" Aptana, unless they have a 'branded' Eclipse build. Flex Builder can be used like that - either as a plugin or a full Eclipse build. In that case, then yes, you can install the plugins.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>One thing you did fail to mention in your post is which version of Eclipse.  Actually, there are two decisions, one is product version and the other is package version.  CFEclipse has a note on their website regarding the problems working with the latest version of Eclipse (3.4).  Therefore, to get started, one should stick with the Europa version of Eclipse (3.3).  When you go to the Eclipse downloads page, you need to click on the link for older versions to find Europa.</p><p>Once at the Europa downloads, then one needs to decide which package version.  There are versions for Java Developers, Java EE Developers, C/C++ Developers, and RCP/Plug-in Developers.  The last version provides the source code to aid in developing Eclipse Plug-ins.  When I rebuilt my set-up recently, I chose the Java Developers version.  It provided the base Eclipse package, plus some of the basic WTP (Web Tools Platform), like XML Editor.</p><p>I did add Collabnet's Desktop, SubEclipse, the CF packages you mentioned, and Aptana Community Edition Plug-in to my set up.</p><p>A future topic for you to address is how to use Eclipse for CF development.  This is one area where I still struggle, specifically when it comes to whether to locate projects in my personal workspace (I am using Windows, both Vista and XP, along with IIS) or in one's web folder (e.g., on Windows, this is typically C:|D:\inetpub).  Along with this is when checking out from Subversion, does one check out the entire project, or the trunk/branch they are interested in.  This still is confusing to me.  While, I like having multiple projects available in the working set, unlike Dreamweaver's single project focus, Dreamweaver's local/remote site setup has worked great (at least when developing on Windows).  I develop/test locally, then deploy to a test server for customer review/acceptance testing, and then deploy to production server.  In my current case, the production server is a staging server that uses a commercial tool to update the production cluster servers.</p><p>Thanks for the post.  I hope to see more on this topic.  It can be confusing.</p></div>

And further the standalone edition of Aptana Studio is based on Eclipse too so you can plug other Eclipse plug-ins (like CF Eclipse :) ) into it as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ThomasCase: Good points on the Eclipse version. I should have mentioned that.</p><p>As to actually using Eclipse, I could show an example of what I typically do. To be honest, the old ACME Guide (not sure if it has been updated recently) was the best at this. As to your question about SVN - I always check out the entire project. It's only slow the first time and thats if the project is large.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the commercial kits I particularly like is MyEclipse. it has a lot of addition plugins (XML, database, both web and app server controls, deployment editor etc.) One of the plugins in that package I find very useful is the UML plugin. Being able to use one IDE not only to do class and usecase diagrams, Ajax debugging and database support is very useful. Also it has a Dreamweaver like WYSIWYG view that can be very useful. For a full feature list: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myeclipseide.com%2Fmodule-htmlpages-display-pid-1.html%3AeA26kXiBKqXIb4sAwuEvshAEZ7M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.myeclipseide.com/module-htmlpages-display-pid-1.html">http://www.myeclipseide.com...</a>.</p><p>regards,<br>larry</p><p>The people who make MyEclipse also have a server based plugin management tool called Pulse (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.poweredbypulse.com%2F%29%3Al0QVgdnqhJvS_En3vFdD6n5tHm0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.poweredbypulse.com/)">http://www.poweredbypulse.c...</a>. One of the packages included in Pulse is CFEclipse.</p><p>regards,</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw mention of Yoxos (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yoxos.com%3ABaqQDUnnfaJzzPIM7vB1w127Vr4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.yoxos.com">http://www.yoxos.com</a>) on the CFEclipse site and decided to try it last week. Very nice site for building bundled Eclipse packages, similar to MyEclipse but free. Huge selection of plug-ins to choose from. There are a large number of pre-built "profiles" for just about any development role to make things easy. Once done, you can even save and share your custom profiles -- very handy for companies with small development teams that want to use a standard set of plug-ins.</p><p>The only thing I had to add that Yoxos didn't offer was XMLbuddy, the Adobe ColdFusion extensions, and Flex Builder (of course).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Stefan,</p><p>I don't think there was ever a version created for CF7, but there is one for CF8 (which aside from the new CF8 tags/functions, is still perfectly applicable to CF7). You can download it directly from Adobe at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoldfusion%2Fdownloads.html%23cfdevtools%3ApiKGe7q4OhvQSO2DsnMe61vRftQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads.html#cfdevtools">http://www.adobe.com/suppor...</a>. Look for the item titled "ColdFusion 8 Help Files for Eclipse".</p></div>
