		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome summary Ray.</p><p>For the admin area of a fairly large enterprise system, we chose swfaddress (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asual.com%2Fswfaddress%2Fsamples%2Fajax%29%3AeGlJKJmATf5FJG5UFyLU6U2WKTM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/samples/ajax)">http://www.asual.com/swfadd...</a> to handle our navigation and history. It worked really well the way that we have everything set up.</p><p>We had chosen to use the Prototype/Scriptaculous library shortly before CF8 came out and the YUI solution didn't appeal to us at the time. However, I'm more and more impressed with the quality of YUI. Once again, great info.</p><p>Tony</p></div>

As such there are various libraries available to implement this, including one with jQuery. I would love to see a jQuery example with CF.navigate if someone has one.</p></div>
