		<div class="comment_text"><p>I only had this issue when I implemented it in our development environment.  When we moved it to production, the watermark went away.  So for us it was no big deal.</p><p>Also, that watermark image is located under \bin (watermark.png).  I haven't tried this yet, but you might be able to just replace that image with a transparent image.  I don't know if that is 'legal' or 'playing by the rules', but just thought I'd throw it out there.  I believe Rodell Basalo brought that up in the previous post about this.</p></div>
