		<div class="comment_text"><p>The websites we are about to go live with were developed with the "IE6 is dead" directive.  We were seriously considering a snarky "your web browser was written in 2001 ... how does that 8-track music sound?" page.</p><p>We're down to less than 5% of our userbase on IE6 and, quite frankly, the customer support cost doesn't balance out the margin on their orders.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In firebug i get a <br>"pos is undefined<br>var distance = targety - pos[1];\n"<br> error.  At first i thought it had to do with win.xy but i tried it with my own cfwindow and its valid in my CF8 even though i didnt see it in ext docs. It gives you the x,y of the window.  assuming that the getwindow worked.  Firebug didnt seem to help at all.  The only way i got it to work was to remove the if statements/case scenarios.  Im not that great at javascript so i'll leave the rest to someone else.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Yeah, I know it's like 4 years later... but this demo doesn't work! =) (on IE9 and FF17) Have you changed your tune on CFWINDOW at all? I got all twisted up with a bootstrap modal and had to fall back to CFWINDOW / CF9. Works OK, if you can find it!? Center option places it off the screen on long pages. Just wondering if you have any thoughts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It doesn't work because the Ext library used in 9 and 10 has been updated. I'm not sure what is used in 9, but I was able to get it working in 10 with two fixes. First:</p><p>Comment out</p><p>var pos = win.xy;</p><p>and switch to</p><p>var pos = [win.x, win.y];</p><p>(This is kind of a dumb change. I could mod other lines to just use win.x and win.y, but was just trying to keep things simple.)</p><p>Then, change</p><p>win.moveTo(origx,newy);</p><p>to</p><p>win.setPagePosition(origx, newy);</p></div>
