		<div class="comment_text"><p>Of course we were told that ColdFusion was a key product at Adobe... my guess is that Flash needs to get all the attention for the first wave. Then they will open the servant's entrance and let us CF developers have content in the Facebook support section also. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having multiple family members on FB, I can partially understand the "Flash push" at the start.  A number of the "Facebook apps" could use a better user interface and Flash is a great GUI tool.</p><p>Like John, I am hoping they open up that "servants entrance" soon - as I would really like to start some development for this API and get my family members involved in the testing.</p><p>I have one other family member that is a CF Developer - so it would be great to start working with him too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's what I get for posting comments before coffee - "I'd really like to start development for this platform AND HAVE a developer's center to turn to for sample code/apps as jump off points."</p><p>My cousin has only recently started CF Development and it's a bit difficult to try and teach him over the phone - much easier if I have some samples already done that we can tear through together.</p><p>I've actually use a few of your apps (Soundings for exmaple) as training aids.</p></div>
