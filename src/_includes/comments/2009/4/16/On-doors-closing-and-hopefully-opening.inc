		<div class="comment_text"><p>meh! you'll be fine man... broadchoice never really made sense to me, and i never REALLY got what market they were after.  albeit a gorgeous application, it seemed very heavy and it really never made sense what id use it for... and i checked with other people and a lot of them didnt get "it" either... so, with that, im glad you are off that team, not for a single good personal reason other than, i didnt get it anyway :)</p><p>bon chance!</p></div>
