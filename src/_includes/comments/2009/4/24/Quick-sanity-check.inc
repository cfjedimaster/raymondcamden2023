		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think posting the external links every so often would be a bonus. It's nice to be able to scan those sort of lists to see if there are posts one missed during the week, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the reasons why your blog has stayed in my consciousness while others have been forgotten is because yours will post to my email inbox.<br>I regularly read GMail, but don't take the time to consciously open up an RSS reader, such as Google Reader.</p><p>It took over a year of cajoling by a friend of mine to convince me to distract myself a few times a day to see what's going on in the twitterverse.</p><p>That was a long way around saying: There's no way to subscribe (except through RSS, which I don't read).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A weekly list of links would be very useful.  I follow you here - RSS reader - so a list of external posts would be useful.  That said, I could always add the Alagad feed.</p></div>
