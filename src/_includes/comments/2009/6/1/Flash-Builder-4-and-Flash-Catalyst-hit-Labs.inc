		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would assume that Adobe just made the decision based on sales. Do you honestly think FB would sell enough to warrant the additional cost? (Although I assume the cost isn't much more since it's all Eclipse based.) Adobe isn't stupid - if they could make money off of it I'm sure they would.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>300 votes x $250 x 10 'people who would buy if they could but didn't vote' = ~750 thousand dollars.<br>I don't mean to tell Adobe how to do business, but that's a lot of money. They'd make a profit.</p><p>If the plan is to let Builder on Linux wither on the vine, then they should come out and say so, not let it dangle on Labs, ticking down to it's time-limited license expiring. <br>Then all it's users can go off and look at their other options - IntelliJ's product, or something not-Flex based at all (QT is on all three platforms, for instance, as is Gears). I wouldn't want to throw away my investment in Flex unless I had to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I seriously doubt everyone who _says_ they want FB on Linux would actually pay for it.</p><p>That being said, if Adobe has NOT made an official statement, they absolutely should. I'm 100% in agreement with you here.</p></div>
