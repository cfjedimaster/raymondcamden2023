		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it sounds fine, but only if you read the note above.  I'm sure you realize that most people don't actually read web pages -- they just scan for the part of the page that is important to them -- so I would recommend putting the explanation of what "I'm willing to pay" means right under or next to the check box.  Maybe add a "more info" link right there that reveals it.</p><p>I would also review how you are using the word "your" throughout the form.  If "you" is the person filling out the form, then it sounds like you, Raymond, are the one who may be willing to pay.  Okay, so I was an English major in a former life  :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You're an entrepreneur now, so -- yes! I think inquiring on whether the submitter is willing to pay for support can, if anything, give you an idea of the demand for your services from those that locate your site.  Take it a step further and setup landing pages to promote your services. Another idea, which is what I do, is sell your services on a retainer basis -- money up front &amp; helps you plan long term knowing you have cash coming in for services not yet rendered while you get other types of work such as this type of support and projects.</p><p>Good luck!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Going to piggy-back a bit on Jason's comment.</p><p>Folks might want to take note that Ben's advertised rate isn't Ben's rate.  It's Epicenter Consulting's rate.  Epicenter is a business, and as such, incurs things like operating expenses, etc.  This isn't a matter of Ben working for somebody else from 9 to 5, then going home and doing some "side work".</p><p>For a development firm (not -developer-, but rather -development firm-), in NYC I can assure you the advertised rate is more than fair.</p><p>I think it's also pretty cool that both Ben and Ray are putting the rates on the page up front.  That takes a certain amount of testicular fortitude.  They're potentially losing clients to whom they may never have had the opportunity to provide a sales pitch.  But it's honest and straightforward and in the end, saves everybody time (assuming the potential client just wouldn't have had those kinds of funds available).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not questioning Ben's rate. If you look at my original comment I said if you can get it, great. What I was questioning is in this bad economy do people still have $225/hr to shell out?</p><p>I'm always interested in how my city compares to other areas, so when I used to get calls from small companies asking for a basic quicky ecommerce cart for $2000, they are now asking if I can do it for $600. Of course they also ask me if Joomla can do that for free.</p><p>So when I saw Ben's company rate, of course I was shocked that people still have that kind of dough to shell out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@papichulo<br>If I'm not mistaken Ben operates out of New York City.  Ray is located in Louisiana.  I've been a consultant for a long time and I can tell you that geography, firm overhead and client size has a lot to do with rates.  New York and California bill much higher per hour than say Indianapolis (where I live and work).  I get your point about the economy and all but honestly your skills are worth whatever a competitive market will tolerate.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally my location should not matter. I charge what I think I'm worth. Yes, I live in an area that has a low cost of living, but does that mean the work I do isn't as valuable as Ben's? Of course not. As it stands, if the worker is in area A and the client is in worker B, what cost of living should be applied?</p><p>Personally, I think 145 is a fair rate for someone of my skill set. It is higher than average, but my skills are higher than average (boy I hope that doesn't sound as egotistical as it may).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray<br>First off, you should know that I have all of the respect in the world for you and your wide breadth of skills.  You probably know that I have that respect from any of the following key indicators...<br>-Constant Compliments and Positive Support<br>-Buying crap off your wish list (probably on at least 3 different occasions)<br>-Being a daily visitor and commenter on this blog<br>-Buying damn near everything you've ever published and recommending it to others countless times both in person and on several websites<br>-Running ideas by you here and there via e-mail<br>(I have actually restructured large portions of projects based on some of the casual points that you've made so think hard before you speak! - LOL)</p><p>For all of your great attributes however, as far as this point is concerned you are flat out wrong and there are about 300 years worth of economic papers written by people much smarter than I'll ever be to prove it.  I believe that much like me - part of you is very much an idealist and that is what has probably shaped your apparent belief that revenue and cost of goods sold for services is the same everywhere.  The true fact of the matter is that what your potential consumer is willing to pay, what a competing entity charges for the same product or service, as well as the location (which directly affects the availability and cost of all resources including labor - which is the most volatile aspect of any economics equation) will all play a factor in how much something is sold for.</p><p>Do you think that US companies have moved all remote call centers to India and farmed development, engineering and support jobs out to the likes of India, China and Russia because we like them better than our own folks or because it is easy to communicate with them (it's not - trust me)? <br>You may have priced yourself at this rate because you took a few casual queries of what was out there and decided that you were worth X but if you were running a consulting firm with 20 guys just like yourself then there would be a lot more factored in than what you thought something was worth off the top of your head.</p><p>I could see a future where due to the remote nature of software development that standard pricing ranges come into play but for now it's just not a reality.  I will concede that it could happen, but for now - rates for software development aren't as predictable and stable of a commodity as buying bandwidth, storage, funny t-shirts or phone service.<br>Now that you're pissed off - please return to the top of the post and remember the nice things that I said about you a moment ago - they're all true :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Andy, first off, no need to prefix criticisms with "I have respect..." My ego isn't that fragile. (Well, it is, but I feel better saying you don't have to worry about it. ;)</p><p>I'll definitely admit to not being an economic theorist, nor even a businessman. (I'm a coder geek and proud.) I will say that it may not make sense to compare 300 years of economic theory with the world of the Internet. Obviously the Internet doesn't make all the theories go away (Ahem, we all remember the bust), but at the same time, I think some factors, location being one of them, have been modified at least. You mentioned other factors (what a client is willing to pay, what the competition charges) and I definitely agree with all of them of course.</p><p>I mean, consider movie stars. You don't where Tom Cruise gets his mail. You hire him. He works for you. Period. When he is done he goes back to whatever box the scientologists put him in. Shoot, most clients/potential clients who contact me don't even know where I live, nor do they ask typically. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well let's just agree that scientologists are fun for remote "people watching" (yes folks it is a sport).  I do wish that more clients treated developers like movie stars but I don't get much beyond free event tickets and the occasional starbucks out of clients.<br>I did read a recent article from an economist that posed an interesting theory in which he stated something to the effect of there being a new economic model where services were categorized and valued in only two ways - services that could be done over or wire vs. services that had to be performed in person.  His point was that being a mechanic in today's economic climate is a safer bet than reading a radiology film, writing a computer program or being an editor.<br>Food for thought - but who cares because in about 43 minutes or so it will be Miller Time!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know we're wildly off-topic here, but that's never stopped me before so... :)</p><p>I agree with Andy here.  Yes, you charge what you think you're worth.  But that "worth" has to do with what it costs you to live your life.  If you spend 3 hours on a project, you want to know that 3 hours can provide enough revenue for you to do (fill in the blank).</p><p>If you moved to NYC or San Fran or someplace similar, you'd quickly find that the rate you're charging isn't "worth" what it was.  Therefore, your "worth" for each of those hours isn't what it was.  The money you brought in for that 3 hour project isn't going as far as it did, and may no longer even be worthwhile.</p><p>I charge more now than I did when I lived in lower cost-of-living areas.  I'm still the same developer (I mean, I'd like to think I've improved somewhat), but my hourly "worth" needs to provide me with "x" in order for it to be a worthwhile effort.</p><p>Anyway, just my $0.04 (yeah, 'cuz I'm in the Bay Area).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm with you here.  I think that even if you don't end up getting paid for any of the quick help you provide, you remind people that your work is valuable.  In discussions I have had with co-workers about your blog-posts or open-source products (we use lighthouse-pro quite a bit), on more than one occasion, I have encountered people that associate you with Adobe.  Mainly because your name appears on the ColdFusion Books aside Ben Forta.  This, I think, might make people assume that they are owed your assistance it they send you a question, despite the fact that your site does not claim that you represent Adobe.</p><p>Just a thought.</p><p>Overall, I think it's a great idea.  There are plenty of companies that need some quick help with a CF or Flex issue that have the cash and would be happy to shell it out for your expertise.  My company has shelled out thousands and thousands of dollars for CF training that is, in my opinion, inferior to some of the presentations you have given to user groups.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me it's fair, because in this profession we spend a lot time study learning the right way to make our work. For example I spend every day a hour learning something new, when other people are just seat in from the TV, or their beds sleeping. I known this is personal because it's the way I like be a better professional every day.</p><p>But it's no fair when some who doesn't do his homework ask you for help. I receive a lot of email's at my blog, students the offer pay me to make their homework's.</p><p>It's your knowledge Ray do what you feel better.</p><p>And I know one day your goint to be an Evangelist of Adobe.</p></div>

I think it would be a good idea to pass some stuff off for a commission better than telling the user that you can't help them because you're not familiar with a particular subject.</p></div>
