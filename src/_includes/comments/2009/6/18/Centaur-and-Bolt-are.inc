		<div class="comment_text"><p>A tiered pricing model for CF9 would be nice. Something along the lines of 0-500 requests a day for free, 500-1000 requests for X dollars and so on. That way the more value you get and (likely) more money you make, the more you pay. It would solve the Cloud pricing awkwardness too. The only loophole I see is with internal corporate apps that may have low usage but provide extremely high value to the corp.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Adam: The limit could be built right into the server, like how the developer mode only allows 3 visitors. Requests would just stop being served until you upgrade tiers. That would happen anyway if your hardware wasn't load-blanced and clustered for slashdot type traffic. I know it doesn't sound great, and there are a lot of kinks to iron out, but if the super-smart folks at Adobe did figure out a nice clean way of charging by usage rather than features, I think almost everyone would love it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love reading the developers discussion of Cold Fusion (including the pricing).<br>May I inject a question as an IT manager? I would appreciate your feedback.<br>Why would I purchase ColdFusion for development in my shop when it costs me extra for the server software to run it? We have a ColdFusion server and every time there is a new release I have to spend thousands of dollars to upgrade the server. Not to mention, there always seems to be issues configuring the CF server to work in our environment and security setup. In today’s economy I have to watch every penny and it just seems more cost effective to go with J2EE or even .NET (as it runs on IIS). <br>Thanks in advance for your responses.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@John Richard, I feel your pain, but let me offer you some thoughts.</p><p>As a language, CFML is really awesome. It's easy, fast and complete. I've coded in many other languages, from .NET and php to grails and java. I am telling you it is just so much clearer, easier and faster.</p><p>But what about the cost. Even if php is worse, it's not like it's $7,000 worse, right? It would be really nice if you could code in cfml for free, and better yet, using an open source solution, wouldn't it? Well guess what, IT IS! There is not only one but two stable, production-ready FOSS implementations for cfml: Railo (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgetrailo.com%3AHtIHX5Yw1uzoo4zc7ntezpm_vkA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="getrailo.com">getrailo.com</a>) and OpenBD (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopenbluedragon.org%3Au1GOVmtNcsEv84CDoP-wH0uJx_Y&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="openbluedragon.org">openbluedragon.org</a>).</p><p>Railo is actually an offical JBoss project and some people claim that it's faster and better than the original Coldfusion, but that's up for debate of course, and each of them offers their own strengths and value propositions.</p><p>Coldfusion itself offers lots of value (especially the upcoming version 9) that may actually save you money - like integrated charting, integrated search, integrated Hibernate, and so on... Buying equivalent products or taking the time to integrate free versions yourself costs time at least (and therefore money) or straight money.</p><p>The other day I was asked to come up with a charting solution for our Reporting Services platform. There are lots of free charting packages out there, but after serious evaluation, estimation and testing, we opted for the very expensive Dundas Charts solution. Why? Not only because the results would be much prettier, but because at the end it would directly save us money. The license fee is only part of the cost, but when you include the expensive contractors to perform the complex integration of a less polished product, and the lost productivity of using a less sophisticated api and development tools, the net result is more money, not less. The calculation is just a little trickier and less straight forward to do - but we did it and its documented right there on a sheet of paper. The more expensive product is, for us, cheaper to own.</p><p>Just some thoughts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@John Richard - The speed at which you can develop in CF knocks many other languages into a cocked hat. Invoking a web service takes 1 line of code in CF - you try that in .NET. You're basically paying for stuff that is ready made. If you don't need what's in it then you can't justify the price.</p><p>Anybody heard anything about potential CF in the cloud? Amazon Web Services looks pretty good for Oracle, Linux etc so you're basically paying by the hour for your server and DB. I'd love to be able to have CF as part of that deal so if you do get a traffic spike you can upscale painlessly and downscale again after the initial surge. Any ideas?</p></div>
