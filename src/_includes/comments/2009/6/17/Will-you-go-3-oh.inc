		<div class="comment_text"><p>So far:</p><p>I lost my contacts. That was my fault though, not 3.0. I removed a calendar, and somehow that nuked my contacts too. Mainly I clicked a bit too quick, but part of me still feels like the calendar/contact area of the OS is a bit odd.</p><p>I had 5 apps marked as updated. I clicked Update All. I then got 5 'You must agree to new terms' warnings. I went through this 3-4 times, repeating the same TOC page and agreeing to terms. Finally 4 of my apps got updated. One app simply wouldn't update. It kept asking me to agree to the new terms.</p><p>Oh, and my new 3Gs? Marked 'prepared for shipment' and apparently it arrives tomorrow still. I assume this means overnight delivery.</p></div>
