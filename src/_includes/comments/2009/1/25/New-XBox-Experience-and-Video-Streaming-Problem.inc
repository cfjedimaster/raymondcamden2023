		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not telling anyone to break their seal and void the warranty but my 360 was loud beyond just a minor annoyance.  Took it apart and found the heatsink covered in blanket of dust (had it laying directly on carpet for a while and guess fibers collected over time).  Also found that one of the fans was actually out.  Ordered a replacement fan and it's back to acceptable level.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I prefer the old UI.  They've gone all Wii on us and that is totally not their market.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking Wii - I have one of those too and I love it.  They should've just stuck with the old UI and added the enhancements.  We probably would've got the update much sooner.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Find a video and try to play it. You should get the error about not having the right download. If you click ok, or show details, or whatever, you will see the download listed with a checkmark next to it. The checkmark applies that it is already downloaded. If you click on the download though you have the option to download it _again_, and that will (should) clear the issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't mind the new interface, but I do take issue with its organization and lack of complete customizability. When I first installed it it took me forever to figure out where my game demos were going.</p><p>COPY TO HARD DRIVE OWNS! The only thing cooler would be if they let you copy to drive and play without having to insert the DVD. Even if there was some hard core security in place to only let this happen to one console per game, I would be all for it.</p><p>Bottom line: The 360 AND Live are incredible products. Like, amazing products. So much so that it confuses people to try and wrap their head around the fact that Microsoft is responsible for them. Props to Redmo.</p></div>
