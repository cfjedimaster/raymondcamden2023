		<div class="comment_text"><p>Obvious disclaimer:  IANAL.</p><p>Ray, what bothers me most is the change in licensing of the content.  While SYS-CON maintained a traditional copyright of the content they'd post online, Ulitzer is relicensing all of the content under Creative Commons.</p><p>I don't have any problem with CC licensing - it's something I'd like to move Firemoss content to - but I'd like it to be *my* choice, as I sometimes get paid for authoring.</p><p>I'm not certain of the details of the standard SYS-CON agreement, so I can't look up whether it grants full rights for them to do whatever they want, including altering the duplication rights for the material.</p><p>So..yeah, if anyone has a copy of any contract with SYS-CON, please let us know.</p><p>Even if they're within their rights to change the licensing on our content to Creative Commons, I know of a few articles appearing on the Ulitzer site that were never published or even submitted to CFDJ or SYS-CON in the first place.  If anyone else knows of any, please speak up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I noticed it this morning too.  I had articles from way way back.  If they had not changed licensing, it wasn't sys-con (who I don't trust at all) and they had some link backs to authors and sources it wouldn't be AS bad.  Still, they are making a big deal of this site when really its just a rehash of old content and should be marked as spam in my opinion as its just the same content from the other site.

Basically, they intend to have it be a site where you can publish articles and receive ad revenue from those articles.  Right now, however, it's pre-beta.</p><p>I did ask the question "Is Ulitzer SYS-CON?" and was told that she couldn't give me an answer she was "comfortable with."  Fair enough.</p><p>Kym says she'll be emailing me a way to log in to my author portal and information on the SYS-CON/Ulitzer relationship.  I'll clear sharing it with them and share it however I can.</p><p>If Ulitzer doesn't want their responses to any of my questions made public, I'll be happy to provide contact information and the questions themselves so that others can ask.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I haven't gone to this site, and I won't. It's time to but an end to this bullsh** right now. Within the next month, we can expect to see a derogatory CF posting that will get the community up in arms and drive traffic to their site. We have to be READY for that, and when it happens, we cannot fall into the trap. You are probably the most well known CF bloggers out there, so maybe you can spread the word - don't take the bait. Outside of your own matter (the re-publishing of your prior work), there is nothing that this re-branded sys-con site can bring to the table.</p><p>Between us all, we need to ignore this site. If we see a CF blogger reference the site, we need to ask them to get on board, step back, and delete posts.</p><p>This site will be relevant for as long as WE make it relevant.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I don't think THIS will drive traffic, but these guys are a business, and when they have no traction, they will sit in a conference room and ask "how do we drive traffic to the site?"</p><p>One way is to mend fences, and produce quality articles. Another is to post something inflammatory, and get people to follow up. The latter is the path of least and the shortest resistance. Like a 2 year old throwing a temper tantrum (something I've had a lot of experience with recently) they will only feel relevant if they are given the necessary attention. That's what happened at Sys-con, and I think until we are proven otherwise, that's what will happen here.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, that's being awfully nice of you - how about this: After Adobe dropped advertising support for sys-con - citing the relevance of the site in an every increasingly blogged world - the CFDJ outright lied about the state of ColdFusion. At first it referenced "expert" opinion without presenting the "experts" credentials. When pressed to do so, sys-con then ceased to name their experts, and went to "unnamed sources". Eventually, sys-con turned off the ability for viewers to post comments to stories, and would not allow feedback directly to the persons responsible for constructing the articles in question. Of course, these articles and experts all referenced the demise and decline of ColdFusion as a technology when the facts indicated otherwise.</p><p>Now, all this is before we even get to the actual editorial content itself, which was dubious at best - the articles were poorly constructed, and riddled with spelling errors that any MS DOS 1.0 based word processing system would have easily corrected. In the end, sys-con stated it was dropping the CFDJ because it believed CF had lost its technical relevance.</p><p>That, of course, was before CF version 8 was released, and after they declared Adobe was dropping support for CF because Tim Buntel had moved on to another position, internally within Adobe.</p><p>Funnily enough, we haven't really heard a lot from them since CF8, until now.</p><p>Davo</p></div>

Based on my interpretation; the republication is completely within the terms of their default contract (circa 2004).  Using the authors name in the domain name is a bit of a gray area, though.</p><p> If you didn't sign the default contract; or have a different interpretation, call your lawyers.</p></div>

Well, me and Sean.</p><p>Oh, as an additional form of advice, make sure the content you submitted or that they spidered from your site/blog has not been altered. They have a tendency of changing things, such as adding "ColdFusion killer" to the front of one article's title. An alteration that is still in their copy but not in the authors original.</p><p>So much for supporting CF.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't plan on calling him, he didn't call us. I don't think anyone here is saying the idea is horrible. I can't speak for everyone, but it looked like your site was going full speed ahead with our ancient articles and bio's without having tried to contact any of us with updated info. I know that at least in my case, both my articles and bio would have probably only served to confuse people with new search results for information that doesn't apply to any current versions. Couple this with the past judgement calls by sys-con to "pull in" our personal blog articles without any sort of permission and publish them on their website and you have the recipe for some sour folks. Thanks for removing our articles though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Based on Ulitzer Support Team's last comment, I googled "Fuat Kircaali". Amazing what articles come up describing his [apparent] lack of business ethics. Also, is "ulitzer" supposed to like "pulitzer", as in Pulitzer Prize? If so, what a joke!</p><p>By the way, I've always thought sys-con's site(s) were difficult to navigate, overly ad-centric, outdated, and all about self-/cross-promotion of their brands. Even googling "ulitzer" turns up mostly articles from their domain or sys-con's domain tooting their own horn. Ridiculous.</p></div>
