		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, how good it does the hearts of us DW stalwarts to see you taking so well to this new version. I had been on the bandwagon for earlier versions because of the fluid handling of CSS, and DWCS4's power with Spry and other code tasks have just been beautiful evolutions of the application.</p></div>
