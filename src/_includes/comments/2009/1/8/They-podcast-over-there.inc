		<div class="comment_text"><p>You're right about the driving.  Even a 20 minute drive to work means 40 minutes worth of training if you're an avid podcast listener.  It's amazing that you can go out for a bite to eat and learn a tidbit as well.<br>I would download boagworld or ColdFusion weekly, burn it to a CD and listen in the car.<br>Maybe I should get one of those new fangled devices everyone's talking about.</p></div>
