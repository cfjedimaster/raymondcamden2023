		<div class="comment_text"><p>shameless plug alert: don't forget to check out the insanely sexy presentation on the hottest topic in the land. that's right... unit testing! <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftv.adobe.com%2F%23vi%2Bf15384v1035%3A7wn0scgRXnMpZYjGG2NbefbaaSo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tv.adobe.com/#vi+f15384v1035">http://tv.adobe.com/#vi+f15...</a>  This isn't your momma's presentation on testing though. this is on how to test hard stuff.</p><p>i've watched a few other presentations so far, and I strongly recommend the "wireframing with catalyst" video. Excellent!</p></div>
