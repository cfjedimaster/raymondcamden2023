		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, well its not as easy as I first thought.  Almost done writing a CFC to handle the linked list, and there is a lot of boiler plate code to Add(), GetNextValue() to iterate through, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting post Ray. You inspired me to nerd out and see if there is a Java way.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can see the actual Utility classes at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjava.sun.com%2Fjavase%2F6%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2Fjava%2Futil%2Fpackage-summary.html%3Aih4PCRn-O9Fbc7qbJHlkQgwSJCc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/...</a>. However it helps to know what the foundation of various CF data types are. For example, an array is java.util.Vector and a structure is java.util.Hashtable. Basic variables are based on java.lang.String, and are dynamically type-cast to double, int, etc... From there you can see what is available under the hood, and what other utility classes can affect these.</p><p>Happy coding!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Again, Ray, thank you very much for taking the time to go through this, it is much appreciated.  Unfortunately the project got bumped for the last few months and I am only now being asked to go back to it...<br>Unfortunately though, it seems (at least to me :) ) to be a lot more complicated than I had originally thought.  There could, in theory, be far more than two groups of results within the query that would need to be sorted amongst themselves and then, being that it's a query of a db to begin with, every time someone viewed the results, it would start from the same place, therefore always removing the same first items from each 'group' to place at the end. (That is, even if I COULD get my query converted to an array properly without errors!! )<br>I think I may need to rethink my entire approach.  If I look at the page and see a,b,c,d,e then you look at the page, you should see b,c,a,e,d, then I refresh the page, I should see c,a,b,d,e.  So, I guess I need to keep track of which record was last viewed as the first record.<br>Anyway, sorry to ramble, apologies for the delayed response, and thanks again for the help!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No worries - hope you get it solved! As just an FYI, you can use an Application variable to store the last view. That ensures I get view 1, then you get view 2, and if you reload you get view 3, then if I reload I get view 4. This is a fairly typical 'banner rotation' type script.</p></div>
