		<div class="comment_text"><p>My clients are mostly corp &amp; gov which means I can't even begin to consider using AIR because the runtime requires an install on the client which is a big no-no. If Adobe merge their Flash Player and AIR runtime into a single install and disallow the installation of Flash separately then in a few years time corps &amp; govs will have no choice but to allow AIR onto the desktop if they are to continue supporting Flash. At the moment there is no serious business justification for them to permit AIR to be installed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Gary F - "No business justification"?</p><p>Write an AIR app that an Enterprise can't live without and see how quickly they justify it. Don't look at it from the perspective of them not wanting to allow AIR. Look at it from the perspective of they just haven't had a reason to install it yet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Love the SW metaphor, Ray. I haven't actually push clients to consider AIR as I know the battles that lie ahead if I go down that route, and the only key benefit that web app alternatives are lacking (within the scope) is the ability to be minimised with notifications to new activity.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm using AIR 2 to build the world's first great web browser.  Javascript performance on the webkit in AIR 2 is SOOOO FAST ( almost as fast feeling as Chrome on Windows ).</p><p>Speaking of which, I haven't been able to get this question answered elsewhere. Does anyone know the most up-to-date/preferred method ( classes ) for Flash Remoting from pure Actionscript 3 ( Not in a Flex app ) to ColdFusion?
