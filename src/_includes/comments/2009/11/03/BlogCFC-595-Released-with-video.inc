		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>Instead of having it delete right away you should have the ability to confirm the delete. Also view the post ( maybe in a cfwindow? ). Another thing that would be nice is how you said it only returns 200 results, you should allow the user to select the amount of results that display you know 10. 20.. 50.. 100.. 200 etc...</p><p>Looking good</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Chris:  I highly recommend Araxis Merge (30-day free trial) for merging new versions in.  It compares all files in a folder for you and shows you the changes.  I have slightly modified BlogCFC over time, but it made it pretty easy to highlight the code changes as I copied them over.  And thanks to Ray, he keeps pretty good release notes of everything he changes if you read them all in order.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Chris: To add to Brad's comment - the readme.txt always describes which files changed, so if you knew you modified index.cfm for styling purposes, then you can look at the changes and see if that is one of the files changed. You can then followup by using a diff too to see how to get it in.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Using WP themes would be impossible since it includes PHP. I've actually _got_ a working theming engine in my v6 repo locally, but it just feels wrong to me. It supported 100% no code themes (just tokens, like %entrytitle%), but... well as I said. It felt wrong.</p><p>I cannot, and will not, make any promises on 6. One of the reasons I've made so many 5.9.X updates this year is that I felt like the product was languishing, and I didn't want to screw over my "customers" by making them wait forever for a new version. I'm actually pretty darn happy with BlogCFC now - I think it's got some strong features, but obviously the lack of themes that don't conflict with the core code is a big issue.</p><p>My _current_ thinking, and this is WAY off the record (even though I'm posting it here in a public comment), is that themes will work via simple custom tags. So you would write a displayEntries custom tag (if you want) that abides by a 'contract'. Ie, you know that BLogCFC always passes you a query with columns A, B, and C. In v7 I may add D, but it won't break your theme since I won't remove the old columns.</p></div>
