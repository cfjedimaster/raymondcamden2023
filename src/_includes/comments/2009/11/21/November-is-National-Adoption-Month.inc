		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've seen your comments on "real parents" a few times between your blog and twitter. I don't disagree with you, but as an adoptee, I really have to impress upon you that this is something that you need to understand is not typically meant as an insult - especially when said by younger adoptees.</p><p>I've always known that I was adopted. One of the bedtime stories my parents told me growing up was "how [they] got me". Still, growing up, I would often interchange "birth parents" with "real parents". Not as any slight to my parents, but due to deep down feelings and issues.</p><p>I could probably write endlessly on this, but I will leave it with a reminder that many, if not most adoptees use the words interchangeably at some point. If your children do, it doesn't mean they don't love you.</p><p>p.s. I apologize if this comes out convoluted, I went back and edited this like a fajillion times.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Lola: Eh? By rolled do you mean create? And by site which site do you mean?</p><p>@Joe: Good point here - but I was really talking about _non_ adoptive parents/kids. Ie, the general public. I can be a lot more understanding my kids using the term than someone who isn't adopted.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My sister is also adopted from South Korea.  It's funny, those outside our family have so many questions and find it so fascinating, but to me and my siblings, it was so normal.  "You don't get baby sisters from the hospital, you pick them up at the airport... and baby sisters are Korean!"</p><p>I never got to hear the questions that were asked of my parents, but I do recall other kids asking questions.  They wanted to know if my sister "accepted" that she was adopted and if she missed her birth mother.  Adopted as an infant, she has no memory of her biological parents, and even a Korean baby among blond hair, blue eyed siblings is accepting of the only family situation she's ever known.</p><p>Thanks for sharing this...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>As an adoptive parent, you can speak for me anytime!  My son was born in Iowa, but is half-Cambodian and half-Mexican.  I love that he doesn't look like me, it doesn't make us any less a family, although I sometimes wonder if it helps us appreciate each other a little more!</p><p>I liked your comments advising to use "birth" or "biological" parent rather than "real" parents.  I always suggest that terminology when answering peoples questions although we sometimes shorten it to Bio-Mom and Bio-Dad.  LOL</p><p>Thanks for sharing about this topic!</p><p>Suze</p></div>
