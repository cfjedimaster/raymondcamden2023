		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm a big fan of Mieville as well, although I've not King Rat or The City &amp; The City yet. I'd been kind of waiting on another New Corbuzon book, but I'm not really sure why that should make me wait to read his other books.</p><p>A related suggestion: Whitechapel Gods by S. M. Peters is another good book that has a similar feel to Meiville, at least the feel Perdido Street Station. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhitechapel-Gods-S-M-Peters%2Fdp%2F0451461932%3Ac5q7nskaWclv9F9Kdp54oeAPkyM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.amazon.com/Whitechapel-Gods-S-M-Peters/dp/0451461932">http://www.amazon.com/White...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The New Corbuzon stuff is a bit... intense. Epic. Mind-blowing. Hence my recommendation of this book, or King Rat, as it is a gentler introduction to the epic-ness. ;) I'd kill for a new book in the series as well.</p><p>Oh - and don't forget Un-London (spelled wrong probably). That was probably his weakest book so far - but still pretty interesting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ha ha, yeah, it is certainly intense. I've often described Meiville as Edger Allen Poe does Fantasy... or maybe Steampunk H. P. Lovecraft... there is a certain feeling of atmosphere and a richness to the vocabulary that I find to be rather rare in fantasy authors.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So it took me a while to get to it, but I finally finished reading this today.  Good recommendation, Ray!  A very imaginative setting; personally, I am a fan of the 'mass form of self-delusion' theory, which I find even more fascinating I first found the overlapping reality idea.</p></div>
