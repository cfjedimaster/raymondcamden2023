		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice work!</p><p>Between this, classic.cfm, dockable.cfm, and ColdFire it looks we've got a fair range of options for going through debug stats. I really wanted to get into the pop-up window (i.e. dockable) a while ago, but Chrome just wouldn't give it any love. That and it's super annoying when previewing pages in CF Builder.</p></div>
