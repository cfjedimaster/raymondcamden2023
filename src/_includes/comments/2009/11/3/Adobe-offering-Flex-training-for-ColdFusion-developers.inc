		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree that it would be nice if the tour went to more cities... I just can't understand why that seems to be the _only_ reaction here. I mean if you can't get to one of the cities, that's unfortunate - but I'd like to see _some_ positive reaction here from somebody. ;) Especially when you consider how many demos we have sat through with Flex that made use of PHP on the back end.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>From what I have gathered, RDS needs to be enabled in the CF admin for cfc communication. Is this required?  If so, what are the odds of a 3rd party web host to enable RDS? (I'm guessing none w/o a dedicated server at $225/month.) I'd love to greatly minimize the various UI display issues with the various browsers and versions using Flex and CF, but unfortunately it's out of my budget.  - Any thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - thanks for the heads up on this! I live in South Dakota but fortunately all my family lives in Denver - therefore I got to fly down here this weekend and will be atteding the seminar tomorrow! I've very excited about it! I've been developing in CF for 5 years now but never tried out Flex- But my boss wants me to check it out and see what I can bring back as far as new and fresh ideas! Thanks again for the heads up!</p></div>
