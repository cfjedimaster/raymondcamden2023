		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray:</p><p>The only examples I´ve seen about CF and Grids are with Ext or cfgrid, that is the same thing, like you said. But don´t you have any good example with jqGrid that could share us? Better if integrate a cfc and a query.</p><p>Thanks, in advance. Rigo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray...<br>Just wanted to say that this is certainly NOT a useless post. I just created a cfgrid and I personally prefer not to have the empty rows at the end... especially as I have a column with clickable url in it. CF likes to fill those fields with a clickable '-' dash which produces various results when you click them.</p><p>Reading your post inspired me to come up with a way to remove the empty rows within my cfc before returning the struct to the cfgrid. This not only helps in the case where you have fewer TOTAL results than your page size as in your example... it also helps when your last page of multiple pages doesn't match up to your page size.</p><p>Yes the grid suddenly shrinks... but I can live with that.<br>Thanks for the inspiration.</p></div>
