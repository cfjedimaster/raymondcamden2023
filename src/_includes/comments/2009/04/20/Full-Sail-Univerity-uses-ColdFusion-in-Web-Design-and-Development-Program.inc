		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the mention!  We're gearing up for a complete rebuild of the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffullsail.edu%3A_sTR8gBhLOC4aHFe7Zusk0p9EZ8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="fullsail.edu">fullsail.edu</a> site this fall/winter (the site there now is about three years old).</p><p>I was fortunate enough to be on the advisory board for the program, and I advocated a lot of the big philosophies the entire community seems to resonate.  I expect to see some sharp grads coming out of there.  :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Full Sail program and website look great. I wonder if they offer a graduate program? I work at Florida State University Admissions, and we have been using Coldfusion for our websites and online forms for a few years. We even have a few BlogCFC implementations, Coldfusion is the best.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've got to admit - hearing from these comments about the other higher ed. institutions that use ColdFusion is pretty cool.  We love it at Full Sail.</p><p>@Daniel Lanza: There are some M.S. programs offered, but the Web Design and Development program isn't there yet (to my knowledge).  However, it was interesting in the advisory board when I saw how much more we wanted to squeeze into the B.S. but couldn't.  There is definitely content remaining for a M.S. but the trick would be teaching concepts that won't be old news by the time you finish the program - even with Full Sail's accelerated pace.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to see opinions on CF have changed at Full Sail. When I taught in the Digital Media program (years ago), some of my co-workers went on and on about how it was a dead end.</p></div>
