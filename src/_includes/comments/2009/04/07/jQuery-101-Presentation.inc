		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you did a good job covering all the basics of things.  Figuring out selectors was one of my biggest hurdles and you explained that and the AJAX functions well.  It helped me understand some things better.  Plus I made it through the whole thing and I have a short attention span ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Looks good. I am thinking though maybe show off one of the Plug Ins, maybe jqGrid so the CF people can look at it and compare it to inbuild cfgrid (even if you don't explain the code in the Preso).</p><p>I also think an immediate question one would get from this preso would be, using jquery instead of CF8-Ajax stuff. So, maybe you want to add a slide on that. For me, its probably down to how much flexibility you want and whats your data size, for example, 5000 records, jqGrid is faster than cfgrid (very minor difference), but it goes up as I go to 50k records.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very nice intro to jQuery, Ray. You covered the bases well and I learned some useful stuff along the way.</p><p>I see that you used $("#select1 option:selected").val() to retrieve the value of a select box, but I have always found that $("#select1").val() will return the value of the selected option. Is there a reason to use the "option:selected" selector, like browser compatibility?</p><p>Another useful plugin is Throbber (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fplugins.jquery.com%2Fproject%2Fthrobber%29%3ABpXANi8eSvzeCio-Hu30KVRGl6s&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/throbber)">http://plugins.jquery.com/p...</a> to automatically display and hide those spinning loading animations. Like most things jQuery, it's just too dang simple to implement, makes me feel that I'm not working hard enough :).</p></div>

The only suggestion I have, since you asked, is that the preamble doesn't need to be so long.</p><p>Ummm, you also indicated in the preso that you'd make the demo files available, and I came back just now to see if there was a download link yet, and I don't see it.</p></div>
