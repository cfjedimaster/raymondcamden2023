		<div class="comment_text"><p>RAY!  Holy cow how do you read my mind all the time.  I was just thinking this weekend how nice it would be if I could find something like this.  Our company REALLY needs something like SugarCRM but I was hesitant because it's not ColdFusion based, and I DON'T want to learn yet another language (5 is enough for now, and I HATE PHP).  However, this app looks like it is WELL thought out, and your wrapper should come in handy.  Thank you so much for always sharing!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The web service call for the login method will not work (I am using the hosted version of Sugar, v 5.5.2). It doesn't like the parameters that are being passed, even though they appear to line up. I am guessing that there have been updates to the Sugar API since ColdSugar was written that are causing this breakdown, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the variables to line up properly. If anyone has any insight, I'd appreciate it greatly!</p></div>
