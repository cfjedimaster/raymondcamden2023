		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, that's a very interesting point. I am a huge fan of CFSaveContent and have never thought about this side-effect. Part of me thinks it's silly to have to put CFOutput around things that don't get evaluated, but part of me things that when you package something for 3rd party use, you want to make it fool-proof.</p><p>What are you thinking? Are you gonna start adding this? Or, just wait till it crops up again?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The worst is to come up with something that you think would make a great blog post idea; so, you get all excited about it and Google it to find out more information, only to find out that you already blogged about it two years ago :)</p><p>(I've been guilty of that several times)</p></div>
