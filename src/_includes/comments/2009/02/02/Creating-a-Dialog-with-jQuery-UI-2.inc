		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Hopefully you'll excuse my ignorance:  I have never worked w/ JQuery.  Is their UI package the same sort of thing as ExtJs, and if so, is it a package of the same caliber?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Neil, I'm probably the worst person to ask. My experience with jQuery UI is now 2 days old. ;) My early impression is no - Ext seems to have the best UI stuff so far. But I don't find Ext as friendly as jQuery (and you know I've had trouble w/ jQuery so that is saying a lot). I've got Cutter's Ext book but haven't had a chance to read it yet though.</p><p>I'd say jQuery's UI stuff is early yet, but the team is definitely working hard on it.</p><p>Nice and vague? :) Hopefully other readers who have used both will chime in.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had no idea there WAS an EXT book - on Amazon?  I'll buy it now.</p><p>In my opinion, EXT is the best available so far.  When I just read your post, I immediately googled the JQuery UI, and was looking thru their widgets, and the tabs widget blew up _badly_ on the ajax content functionality - it seemed to be in a loop that just kept throwing errors, and I had to actually shut the browser via task manager.</p><p>Ext can definitely be a pain in the behind, and I would like tot hink I am fairly capable in JS.  However, their forums are pretty active, and while the docs are incomplete and often flat out wrong, if you ask a question on their forums, they'll usually give you an answer PDQ.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice update - much improved :)</p><p>By the way, we plan to include notes about this with the UI zips, but with themes like the ones you chose which use an em-based global font size, they assume a parent font size of 1em = 10px. If you're going off browser defaults, 1em blows up to around 16px and that's why the text is rather large in these examples. To get it looking how it was intended, you can simply set your body font size to 62.5% (~10px).<br>body {font-size: 62.5%; }</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>jQuery Impromptu is a dialog type plugin which takes dialogs to another level by creating somewhat of a framework for forms.  With version 2 which was just released you can have multiple forms within the same dialog, so you can click "Next", "Next", "Finish" or whatever you declare your buttons to be, so you can easily break down the dialog into steps.  I've put together a screencast of this new functionality here:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrentrichardson.com%2F2009%2F02%2F12%2Fjquery-impromptu-20-states%2F%3AxPIMc5YrOBMg7Zrs35Ow5YfTvtY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://trentrichardson.com/2009/02/12/jquery-impromptu-20-states/">http://trentrichardson.com/...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been using jQuery and jQuery UI for a while now and I can say that you'd be stubborn to not learn both. Cfwindow works great and is pretty easy to work with, but when you've got a site that's loading a ton of data, you're going to need something that's a bit less. Cfwindow brings a long a huge library and works great against cross browsers, but it's too darn big in regards to it's file size and the amount of work the browser needs to put forth.</p><p>jQuery UI dialog window is a much better choice because it's a bit smaller, but only if you download just the dialog itself in the custom download. The UI dialog works awesome and is very easy to interact with, but it's still a little "fluffy" and for a site that needs a smaller size requests, you may want to look for a small jQuery plugin.</p><p>I've found that you can take someone's modal window plugin and easily modify to your site's standards and save a lot on file size.</p><p>You also have the choice of using the jQuery Tools overlay. It's smaller and more simplified and works just as well. I've had some problems with their actual modal display in cross browser, but it's pretty good and saves you on file size.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Keep up the good work Ray.</p><p>P.S. EPIC comment above :)</p></div>
