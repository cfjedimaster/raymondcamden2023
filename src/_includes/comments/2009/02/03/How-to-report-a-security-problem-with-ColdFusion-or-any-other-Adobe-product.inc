		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray do you know if Adobe intends to answer to requests, bug reports, and reports of security problems?</p><p>In my experience all you usually get is a generated message saying something like: "thank you for your input", and then you never hear from Adobe again. :(</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't believe you are guaranteed a response. The guy who pinged me about this said he got a response pretty quickly, but it was a security issue so that makes sense.</p><p>Again though, I can promise that they ARE read. It doesn't mean Adobe will act on them, but they aren't ignored.</p></div>
