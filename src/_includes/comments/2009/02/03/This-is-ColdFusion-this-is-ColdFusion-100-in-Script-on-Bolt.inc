		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rick:</p><p>As long as there is some sort of "heredoc" syntax (a generic form would make more sense than a special case for certain tags) to allow multi-line string collection, the query code they have above is fine.  &lt;cfsavecontent&gt; is my #2 favorite tag, BTW.  Creating large multi-line strings is a nightmare in languages with only simple concatenation.</p><p>But you did bring another question to my mind.  I'm all for making cfscript capable of doing everything cftags can do, but let me ask this:  Will cfscript be able to "embed" cftags?  What's the script-equivalent of the &lt;cfscript&gt; tag itself?  I tend to switch between the two methods, but I love the tags for things such as &lt;cfquery&gt; and &lt;cfargument&gt; because the tag/attribute representation seems more expressive.  If I'm in the middle of a &lt;cffunction&gt; and hit a long string of variable manipulation, I'll switch to script.  But if I start in script, or I'm working in code someone else wrote in script, will I be able to "opt out" and go back to tags for a section?</p><p>The worst thing that could happen with this is if people who code primarily in one method are thrown into code written the other way and suddenly feel like they need to learn a whole new language.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have really mixed feelings about this.  I feel like I've been jerked around by cfscript in the past.  Way back in CF5 days, I rewrote a bunch of code to use cfscript, because it ran a lot faster.  When we moved to CFMX, there was suddenly no performance advantage to cfscript, and because a lot of things couldn't be done in cfscript, I started converting some code back to tags.  I started using CFEclipse, and I converted even more back to tags because then I got validation and code assist.  Now, if cfscript supports more features, and Bolt has really good support for it, will I start converting my code back to cfscript?  I don't know.  I just want my code to be consistent and clean, and having two completely different syntaxes to do the same thing is on balance more of an impediment than a help.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hang on a sec now Ray - you conveniently spread the CFML based query over three lines, when it was one line in the script block. So, lets compare apples to apples - the SQL query evens out, and we are left with 3 lines to set up and execute the query, and thats not including the "q.setSQL" call itself, to the one for the cfquery, and the, are we even counting the tag closing? More structure than code, no?</p><p>Both could be written on one line, but of course, we wouldn't do that. We MAY do that more with the CFML version, because we have the luxury of being able to space the query any way we want - that is to say, with more complicated SQL (and I personally deal with some complicated stuff) I'll space it and comment in it for the sake of future maintenance.</p><p>My main point was that it introduces complexity - logical steps in the building up and executing of a SQL statement that CFML was made to overcome in the first place.</p><p>I'm sure the ASP/PHP/JAVA community will love it ;-)</p></div>

Is it really that big of a difference then? Or I misreading you? Either way - I don't think one or two lines different is going to matter much. If you prefer script, use script.</p><p>And - I wouldn't say it is just ASP/PHP/Java folks. You also got Flex/Flash/AIR folks using scripting as well.</p><p>Again - I was definitely in the 'tags are fine' crowd - but after working a while in scripting only environments (Flex/Groovy), it's amazing how used you get to it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We can't ignore the fact that most of the structure in the tag based syntax is actually functional.  For example, when you write datasource="xyz" in the cfquery tag, CF was calling the q.setDatasource("xyz") for you.  Script-based syntax just makes all that explicit.</p><p>My only hesitation with going back to script-based syntax is that old temptation to start thinking about web sites like a programmer again. The revolutionary vision of CF was to help you design your site using the same thought process the visitor has.  It led to much more interesting, innovative, and usable sites, IMHO.</p><p>The curse of wanting to be like everyone else is just getting your wish.</p><p>/ejt</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dale</p><p>You cannot achieve the simplicity of CFML with AS-based syntax. And CFML and it's simplicity has been one of ColdFusion's unique selling points.</p><p>I agree that it may be more convenient for some developers not to have to change the coding style between a Flex application and a CFC. But, that's just a personal preference.</p><p>I also agree that the tag based syntax is just an abstraction. If there was no need for these, then why is there something called MXML?</p><p>In the past we read things like "write a database query in CFML and in Java and compare the amount of code". CFML is designed to make things simple. No need for things like prepareStatement() and executeQuery().</p><p>These abstractions make it easier to write applications. If I do queryNew() + setDatasource + setSQL() + addParam() + execute(), that's five commands instead of one tag. And there goes the easy-factor that comes with CFML.</p><p>With the new syntax CF code will look just like Java code (or PHP, or ASP, or whatever). And if it's just the same, then why should someone choose ColdFusion over any other language? (I know that CF is more than just a language, but, the new developer making a choice might not know.)</p><p>And the advanced folks that write blog entries and examples and tutorials will use the new syntax, because it is possible.  And that may very well raise the entry level barrier for new developers that depend on these things.</p><p>I know I would not have started with CF if it had been the same as with Java. The argument that caught me was "but it's so much easier with Cold Fusion" (spelling intended ;-))</p><p>It's almost the same as with the return types vs. "duck typing" discussion some time ago. CFML still is not a strong typed language and there is no need for CFML to be like AS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I think you are mis-reading me Ray, when using CFML, the only real coding you are doing is the &lt;cfquery&gt; and &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; tags - I mean are we really going to call the &lt;/cfquery&gt; a line of code? If you insist - I always thought it a structural thing (i.e., you don't have to think about coding it, it doesn't take variables and/or options, it just closes the tag)</p><p>But, ok, 3 vs 5 lines...times a complete application. 66% extra coding, are you saying that this is the one and only section of coding that will produce the extra "bloat" when it comes to script vs. CFML? Is there trade off? Is the scripting faster? Is it easier to debug? Does having MORE lines of code in an application reduce the law-of-averages chances of there being a typo or something out of place that cases QA problems? Or is it just there because the code monkeys are too snobby to use something that is easy to do? Is the "power" of a language/framework defined by how "cool" it is to CODE in, or how good a developer feels when they do something very complicated with lots of syntax that another developer has to fawn over to see "how'd you do that?"</p><p>Maybe it is, but that's not my bag, baby. But, hey, if it negates the "I don't like all those TAGS"/"Its not a script/procedural/blah blah language" arguments from the anti-CF crowd, then have at it. BUT, if you come into my team, scripting CF, you better damn well have an absolutely amazing reason to do so, because my applications are complex enough as it is, and using CFML allows us to concentrate on the business problems, not the coding problems.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

That's _less_ code.</p><p>I'd be willing to bet we could go through and find some cases where you type less and some where you type more with tags versus script.</p><p>I think it is rather presumptuous of you to imply that those who want scripting enhanced are only doing it to be cool or snobby. Maybe they just _like_ it and are more productive? If you and your team are more productive with tags, then sure, stick to it. But don't assume it's just the ruby/cool/whatever crowd who will want/use this new support.</p><p>Again, using just myself as a personal example, I've found that scripting is _enhancing_ my workflow, not making it any more complex.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - you'll have to forgive me, I'm reading off the screenshot, so maybe you can clarify the "Notice how return types and access attributes are specified? That's _less_ code." part of your comment (my eyes are getting worse in my old age!).</p><p>When you say "I'd be willing to bet we could go through and find some cases where you type less and some where you type more with tags versus script." - could we? Hey, that would be great. In all of the scripting languages I've worked with (a little PHP, some Java and mostly ASP), I've never seen it, but maybe Adobe has found a way to do it.</p><p>I'll admit I'm being presumptuous - but that mostly comes from my experiences with those outside the CF world who sneer at the product and people who use it. They look down at a "tag" based syntax as being for the kids - let the grown-ups script. I know, I'm SOOO sensitive! :-)</p><p>I could go on for hours about these situations with other development platforms - I personally witnessed IT departments remove development platforms that end (business) users LOVED, but developers/managers didn't consider it a "real" programming language. That's just so you know, I'm not making these statements in a vacuum, they are decisions I've seen made, and arguments I've heard presented in real life over the years. None of them were valid arguments.</p><p>Of course, script should be used where necessary - but that wasn't the title of your question. You used the "all" keyword, a blanket statement, and thats what I, personally, was replying to.</p><p>It's an interesting debate though, and I'm sure if anyone can bring me around it's the Jedi himself ;-)</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p><p>(p.s., yeah, that last part was a big expectations set up on my part, muhahahaha)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Jeff, Kumar: Why do you assume new people to CF will be confused by script? Maybe they used other scripting languages before? I will say though that if they have 0 programming experience, tagging will certainly be simpler for them, but I don't think it is fair to say that -everyone- new to CF will find script more difficult than tags.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My biggest gripe is having to use cfargument in CFC's. I don't know if it is going to be all or nothing with the cfscript cfc's. Mix and match would be awesome. I don't know how may times I wish I could write a plain old C type function in a CFC like you can in UDF's.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 to Jeff and Kumar.</p><p>There is little question that cfscript syntax is more difficult to follow for newbies.</p><p>While it seems silly to say Adobe should _not_ do this (having options is great, to each his own, etc.) I can definitely see how this could have a negative impact as well.</p><p>Adobe does a pretty poor job of promoting this product, which means much of that burden falls on the shoulders of this community.  When newcomers - or just plain entry-level to intermediate CFML developers - search out to find out how to do things, they will be seeing a hodge-podge of code examples with less uniformity than before.  I suspect that this will confuse and discourage a large group of these developers.</p><p>I guess the balancing act is how much writing CFML in script, or script+tags, enhances the productivity of some in this community versus how much in confuses an alienates others in this community?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK, I see what you're saying now Ray, and I think it does re-affirm the point you are trying to make on "lines of code". It's where you make them that counts more, right? You're more likely to have more queries in an application than you are functions, in general, but you may make up for that in other ways.</p><p>Still, I'm waiting for the compelling reason to use script, other than "I can" (I script, therefore I am???). If there were performance gains by using script, now THAT would get my attention. Whether it be ALL applications, or ALL CFC's, I'm still looking for that reason.</p><p>As for trying it, I'm sure I will, as will my minions! If they present a compelling reason to use script, then we'll definitely go with it, and hey, you never know, I may be back on your blog scolding you for not using script enough!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just to reiterate on my last comment, as I've realized it made no sense - my thoughts are that this feature could not be CF9 specific, but a new way of viewing (and writing) code in Bolt. I guess an analogy can be drawn to the design/code view in dreamweaver, except this is tag/script view. This would make sense, as you could switch to tag view to type queries and to script for functions (which I agree would be SO much faster). The whole thing could then be saved as a tag-based CFC, thus eliminating the confusion to non-scripters when they come to view the document.</p><p>My thought on this came from the &lt;&gt; button in the toolbar, suggesting tag view. I could be wrong, but this would seem like a great way of allowing scripting in ColdFusion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the importance of this feature, from a strategic point of view, surrounds the placement of ColdFusion in relation to Flex and AIR.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know if I'll write many CFCs in cfScript yet. Like Ray mentioned, I think a lot of things will play out marginally faster than using tag syntax and others marginally slower.</p><p>One thing's for sure: I absolutely loathe that query syntax (the screenshot). It seems totally backwards from where I'm standing. Even the concept of being able to instantiate a "query" object before executing its sql feels counter-productive and dim. It feels like jogging in place. It's completely reverse from the tag approach, prepare all of your arguments/attributes, hell, put them into a single collection if you're incredible, and then go. Trigger the functionality. Don't author the tag, fiddle with and change it, and then trigger its real purpose with even more typing. That's nutty.</p><p>I wish it looked like this instead:</p><p>     var cfQPs = {</p><p>          id : { value: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Farguments.id%3A4OezL3xjZJdZ6Xca_bShcIQeaqo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="arguments.id">arguments.id</a>, type: 'int' },<br>          firstName : { value: arguments.firstName, type: 'varchar' }</p><p>     };</p><p>     var sql = "<br>                    select *<br>                    from table<br>                    where id = { id }<br>                    and firstName = { firstName }<br>     ";</p><p>     return cfquery( sql: sql, params: cfQPs );</p><p>Notice I am NOT instantiating a query object, ever. There is absolutely no reason to. I'm calling a global method that does what it should, parallels cfquery, probably the most valuable tag ColdFusion has.</p></div>

They do it because of some frill, productivity gains, economic benefit, reputation, sex appeal, or improved experience. Call me a prophet, but better script support won't convert ANY people to ColdFusion. If anything, the "not a real language" peddlers will change their tune to "so you've finally caught up to 1998" roasting. If anything is going to get ColdFusion adopted it's 1. Exposure and 2. the redux of significant, measurable development and maintenance reduction as the number one selling point. Why else use ColdFusion? It's faster to write. More similar to other languages, in ColdFusion's case isn't a boon, it's a de-individualizer. The more ColdFusion simulates and bends its knees towards other languages, the less differentiating it appears.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>David, I'm not sure we're in disagreement, so let me qualify my comments. First of all, I'm in total agreement with you - adding script support is not going to change the attitudes of the "anti-cf" crowd. They are a lost cause. Even when presented with all the evidence, and the business propositions of a quicker, more efficient way to develop web based applications, they scorn at it and stick to their comfort zone. That's ok by me - some of them are my competitors :-)</p><p>What it DOES do, is allow Adobe to present a solution to development shops, which is tight knit integration of Flex, AIR and CF. The only thing that scripting adds to that proposition is its familiarity to &lt;insert scripting technology&gt; shops when they are presented with code samples. If development shops are adopting Flex/AIR as their development platform, then positioning CF as a logical inclusion can ONLY grow the development base (IMO).</p><p>I kind of agree with you on the "de-individualizer" comment, however, I don't thing being a tag based syntax  is CF distinguishing feature. It's all of the bells and whistles that come with it - the PDF creation, AJAX features, SOAP, Exchange, .Net, etc etc integration (I don't have to evangelize here, you know what I mean), and how easy it is to do all of that compared to other languages and frameworks.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Voted 'yes', despite fact I love CFML, use it everyday since 2002 and think CFML is what does CF great. Voted because I impressed by Flex approach - use MXML for describing interface and ActionScript for implementing logic. In the same time you may use both vise-versa if you like to. I feel such dichotomy will work great in CF as in Flex, something like:</p><p>&lt;cftable dataProvider="#obj.getData()#"&gt;</p><p>or even... &lt;cf:table&gt; ? But in same time obj component will be described in external CFScript file as written above.</p><p>For me pesonally, implementing logic with CFScript looks faster and cleaner than with CFML. I think CFScript should become more what ActionScript is for Flex.</p><p>BTW: Bunch of people I work with came to Coldfusion coding from scripting world and CFScript was their bridge from PHP/Perl/Python to Coldfusion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's interesting to see what an inferiority complex we CF developers have, as evidenced by the argument that, with more cfscript support, others won't look down on CF as not being a "real" language. I can honestly say that 95% of the reason I chose CFML over PHP when I started my business was strictly for the syntax. For me, CFML is RAD because I have a MUCH easier time understanding and writing tags than script. Go ahead and tell me I'm not a "real programmer" because if you don't use CF yourself, I don't give a f--- what you think! It's kind of ironic how right around the time Adam Lehman blogged about how we shouldn't be looking at other languages and that CF should strive to innovate and stand out, here we have everyone looking jealously at Java and AS and worrying about what others think.<br>As a side note, while I think it's a good idea for Adobe to promote CF as the ideal backend for Flex apps, from some of the comments here, it appears that there are those who feel that CF is ONLY good as a Flex backend -- WTF?<br>Yes, yes -- I realize that I would still have the choice to not use cfscript, but my concern would be that CFML would develop an identity crisis and further fragmentation is the last thing a community as small as the CF community needs. A previous poster commented how in the future, open source CF projects might start using more and more script in their model code and it gave me flasbacks of my days trying to wade through OS PHP code -- yuck! I also don't relish the prospect of the CFscripters telling those like me in a few years that my code is stuck in 2008.<br>Anyway -- maybe it's me with the inferiority complex. I totally get that everyone has a right to their opinions and their coding preferences and that it's good that Adobe is listening to the call for more cfcript support. But the bottom line is that -- for me, personally -- it's depressing as hell to see that most CF developers (according to Ray's poll) are pretty much saying that they're unhappy with the syntax they're coding in and it bodes a shift in the language away from what made it such a huge selling point for me.</p></div>

That will give freedom to developers and silence those telling 'Coldfusion is not serious technology because of its taggish language and lousy OO model, blablabla'.</p><p>After getting to know Flex I started to adopt it's approach in Coldfusion - I use CFML tags for describing interface and CFScript for implementing logic. Even for queries - we used to create homebrewn ORM implementation in our team and not using &lt;cfquery&gt; tag anymore.

The more time I spend writing JS and Java the more want to forgo CF tags when writing logic and functions. Tags are ideal when dealing with XHTML. But when writing functions in a CFC, tags get to be a bit much. I spent a year writing PHP and I really missed the simplicity of using cf tags. Escaping quotes and concatenation gets old very fast. But at the same time writing a paragraph of text in order to pass in variables to a function with a dozen args is overkill too.</p><p>As far as the simplicity of tags, and reducing the learning curve, having inspection and autosuggest for external libraries and local vars, a la Bolt, will make it much easier for noobs to get the hang of using CFScript.</p></div>
