		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I definitely see how this would sadden you. My wife and I are hoping to adopt someday, and several of our friends have adopted children from overseas. There are so many unwanted kinds across many countries, that I have to take this as positive news for Korea though. This just means people will focus more on adopting kids from other needy countries.</p><p>God bless you for being a good Father!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I have three kids, all adopted from South Korea, as well.</p><p>Not sure this saddens me. Rather, it makes me wonder if it means that adoption is becoming more acceptable in S. Korea.</p><p>We adopted through the Children's Home Society of MN, reputed to be the first American institution to work with S. Korea on adoption. One of the main reasons we were given for how important foreign adoption was that the kids had virtually no chance of success if left in Korea.</p><p>I'll be following the news related to this and will be anxious to hear the reactions from other Korean Americans we're connected with through the various Korean Culture Camps our kids have gone to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm, I came to this post a bit late.  But, I'm glad I did.  Thanks for posting this.  As you know from a previous post, I'm adopted from SK..  I had to share that article with my parents.  I'm surprised by it - I'm one of three kids that were adopted from South Korea in my family (two cousins are also adopted from there)...   I do feel a bit of hope that they are adopting more and more within the country.  But it is a bit sad that they are discontinuing all international adoptions.</p><p>But, I will always be thankful to my parents and whatnot, that I was adopted when I was - I couldn't see life any other way.</p><p>p.s. next MAX, I'll definitely stop by the Unconference to say hello!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm sad to hear they are closing the program.  We just adopted the most beautiful little boy from S. Korea and want him to have brothers and sisters from there as well.  We are not sure that we will be able to complete our family in that time frame.  I also am a little sad for the children since from my understanding they are placed in orphanges after age 1.  I could be wrong but I'd rather children have a loving home anywhere than have to live in an orphanage in hopes that they will be adopted by a national.</p></div>
