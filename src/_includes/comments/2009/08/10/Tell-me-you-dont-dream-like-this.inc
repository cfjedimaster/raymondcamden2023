		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had number of these types of dreams lately. I think I'm wicked stressed for my CFUnited presentation and it's manifesting in my sleep. I had one dream where I was trapped in a bathroom with a rat that was trying to attack me. Another where I was in a plane that did an emergency landing on a deserted highway in the middle of nowhere. Another where I got caught in the middle of what appeared to be some genocide-based gun fight. And then, over the weekend, I had a dream that someone totally ramsacked my hotel room at CFUnited and broke my eye-glasses in half and I started freaking out that I wasn't going to be able to see any of the presentations. You can be sure I double-checked that I had packed my eye glasses :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray hahah, yep - some things are just toooooooo personal :-)</p><p>i did once have what i thought might be an 'astral projection' it happened right at the moment between sleep and wake in the early hours. i'd once read it's apparently possible to move away from your body provided you're aware of this state you're in... (all hocus pocus hippy rubbish but i'll always have an interest in the unexplained nevertheless)... but after feeling like i had drifted away from my body (felt like pulling something out of thick glue and got about a metre away) i got really scared and whizzed back down only to wake up panicking and greatly relieved to be 'home'.</p><p>lol, writing it down here sounds insane. im extremely sceptical of such things but after that i did understand how maybe a dream within a dream could lead you to think such a thing was happening... or maybe it _was_ happening! arghhh!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A quick way to cool off with a heavy blanket on you is to simply let your feet poke through the end.  Like your fingers, there are a large collection of sensors at your extremities, and covering them will make you feel MUCH warmer than if you don't.  Try it, and you'll probably feel instantly a couple degrees cooler.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting topic.  From around 13 yrs old till around 20 I was actually pretty good at lucid dreaming.  I would start my dreams, see something in them that made absolutely no sense and would then tell myself "oh, I'm dreaming".  It was a very cool experience to have this self revelation and then be able to control the tempo and direction of dreams.  This tended to only work for me in nightmares or very obsurd dreams.  If the dream was any bit normal, I would never realize it.</p><p>Then at 20, I got married and the situation completely changed.  Rather than having totally unreal dreams, my dreams always became exactly what I was worried about.  Nothing like having a double dose of being worried about money, college exams, marriage and car troubles during the waking and sleeping hours.</p><p>I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good dream.  They are either unmemorable or really bad.  Boy I need a beer.   Dangit, I don't drink.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - Don't dwell on it or you can expect that the parts that were off-camera will be on-camera next time. ;)  Kidding, sorry. What's fun is when you realize its a dream and you can take the velociraptor and shrink it into a lizard and put it in the aquarium to play with your gecko.<br>@Daniel - Interestingly, for most of my life I thought everyone was able to remember their dreams and control them. I also used to wake up after a dream "knowing" something. It wasn't part of the dream per se, but I'd have this new found knowledge right after waking up. That information never has stuck with me, its gone 5 minutes after waking up if I don't write it down. (Many useful lines of code have been lost due to this) Years later, I started studying the human mind and what we think we know about it - I was surprised that most cannot remember or control their dreams. It was that point that the lucid dreams stopped for a few years. <br>My take from that and my reading is that there is a self-hypnosis going on here. If you tell yourself as your start falling asleep that you WILL wake up at a certain time, you usually will. Its the same thing with dreams, the level of control or awareness you get will be a function of what you expect will happen, but - it takes practice.</p></div>
