		<div class="comment_text"><p>Honestly if you look at jQuery's selectors from a CSS point of view rather than from a JavaScript or DOM point of view it'll be MUCH simpler to grasp.</p><p>If you can target the object with CSS, then you can access it with a jQuery selector. Plus there's extra stuff in there that's not even possible with CSS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I sure agree with you on this one Ray. I am rounding up Learning jQuery by Yehuda Katz et al and I have Learning jQuery next in my sight.</p><p>But I'm pretty surprised why selectors was a bit difficult in grasping. Anybody coming from a Web Design background should pick this up easily, having been familiar with CSS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@William, @Andy: Both of you seem surprised I had trouble with selectors. But you both assume I was familiar with CSS. I am not. I know the basics, of course, but back when I started web dev, there was no CSS. Even now, most of my work is on the back end, so I'll just be given CSS to use, I don't have to worry about creating it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>These young kids don't know what it was like in the old days. I started web development in 1992 and all we had was a few tags and broken browsers. I guess some things never change. Most of my time has always been spent on the backend. Only the last two years have I been involved with the front end and so much has changed, I find it hard to keep up. Funny how the Web Desingners that that's all there is to web.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey now...I'm no youngster. I didn't start in 1992 like yourself, but at least I started before the current century...1996 is when I really started learning.</p><p>Ray...I know you're not strong with CSS...that's cool. Your strengths lie elsewhere. The primary reason I know CSS so well is that I began my development career as a front end designer.</p><p>I'd be happy to be your sounding block for CSS questions if you like. I love CSS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I always tended to think of CSS as something applied on top of markup. I never really thought of them as selectors ("This crap will be designed to be blue with underlines"). I guess a 'philosophy of jQuery/CSS' class would have helped me in the beginning. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've used jQuery for several years now, written several plug-ins for my company and I love it!  (I love CSS too.)  The jQuery documentation is lacking good examples or difficult to find the function your are looking for.  One common issue that I found during some heavy development last year was that the jQuery site was slow or down frequently.</p><p>What makes jQuery most excellent is that it's cross browser compatibility is very robust.</p><p>Check the jQuery API Browser Air App... this has provided quick and dirty syntax lookup.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2F%3Ar3kW2_d-VqqDgSdFUykqTC4nG1A&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://api.jquery.com/">http://api.jquery.com/</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The new version of the book is now packed with good references, and examples. Most of them are day-to-day examples (chapter one to six), but things get a hotter after chapter seven, where more complex examples and explanations are given.</p></div>
