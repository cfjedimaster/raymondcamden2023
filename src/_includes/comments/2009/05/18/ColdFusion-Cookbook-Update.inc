		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stackoverflow is getting some momentum. You are not supposed to post questions you know the answer to so the data from the cookbook could only be posted in response to a q but it is turning into an amazing resource.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, the source was available. Still is - somewhere. I'll post it again once I wrap the final move.</p><p>As for selling the domain, I've gotten a lot of free software from them. I'll see if they want it, and if so, I'll give it to them. Well, maybe I'll ask for another CF Guy tee shirt.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Your approach to this situation proves once again how well you play the role of steward for the greater ColdFusion community.  It says a lot that you are willing to embrace this development and participate in the creation of a higher profile resource.  Given Adobe's continued investment in CF, it makes sense that we all work to make sure there's plenty of cookbook and sample code ready to go for the new folks.</p><p>Thanks again, Ray - from everybody.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I echo Steve's remarks.  Thanks for all the hard work Ray.  I agree with what you are doing.  Hopefully you will see this as one less thing to worry about.  You definitely have done a major service for the entire Adobe family with this site as well as your others (I LOVE riaforge and contribute what I can)!  Thanks for your work!</p><p>Jason</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Kevin K,</p><p>You could easily and quite acceptably post them to stackoverflow.</p><p>One question that sums it up well is here:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F2572%2Fis-it-poor-etiquette-to-answer-your-own-question%3AxeblBdeNAH9H7EHYE8_bzp5QM0I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2572/is-it-poor-etiquette-to-answer-your-own-question">http://stackoverflow.com/qu...</a>.</p><p>This might however be seen as spam, but it would also be nice to see more cfml postings on the overflow.</p><p>That said I respect ray's move toward solidarity on cfml cookbook recipes</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll ditto George. I'd love to see more questions at SO. SO is very popular and the more CF shows up there the better. I also see nothing wrong with answering your own questions. It happens to me all the time. I try to fix X. I give up and ask for help. As soon as I send the email/post/etc, I discover the solution. So why not help others who may have the question in the future?</p></div>
