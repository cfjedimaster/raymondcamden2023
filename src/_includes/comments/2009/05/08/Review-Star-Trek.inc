		<div class="comment_text"><p>I plan on seeing this next week.  I will admit I am a bit leery.  The last JJ Abrams film that everyone raved abot was Cloverfield and quite honestly, I thought it sucked.  Not just a little bit of suckage, but gargantuan sized suckage - Ishtar sized suckage.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Loved it, enjoyed the ride but I sat back and just watched the movie.  I tend to base a lot of my judgement on if I think about other stuff during movie and I really didn't in this one.  Highly recommend viewing.  Good ride - kirk, bones, spoke, and even scotty was perfect.  I understand the history but didn't really dig the green chick.  That part didn't really work for me.</p><p>Zoid - spend the money and go see it</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agreed with evrything you said, good start, could have been a little better but my girl said she would go to the next movie with a lot less grief so I'm saying it's a victory!!  Overall a good transition.  I was very skeptical at first thinking it was a true pre-TOS story.  How suspensful could you make it if everyone MUST survive for the timeline.  So they dodged that bullet well and now the sky is the limit, with no obligation to the original timeline.  Totally missed what "red matter" was, and also missed the Khan reference so I'm interested to see again.  Can't remember a black hole episode either, but they usually called them singularities and must have wanted to stay away from all the relativistic effects!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My son and I absolutely loved it. Great reboot, well casted and acted...really natural and "fun" interactions among the crew. I agree with most of your points, especially about being "meh" about the Romulans.</p><p>I loved the little touches, like the fact that Kirk is eating an apple during the Kobayashi Maru sequence -- just like he was when he was DESCRIBING it during ST2 - Kahn. Lots of subtle (the Admiral's Beagle - Captain Archer and Sophos from Enterprise and the drinks that Uhara ordred) to some pretty ham-handed ones that I will not divulge here. Also love how they took the "Red Shirts Die in Away Parties" to the absolute comical extreme -- good stuff.</p><p>Count me among those people who are really looking forward to the next one! One final note for discussion: Is it just me, or did anyone else feel like they REALLY overdid the "lens flare" effect throughout the whole movie?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>At least they played the original theme at the end of the movie, so I was glad of that.  I was a bit dissappointed too when they didn't play the theme at first, but I don't think it carries the 'drama' they needed to establish up front.  Pretty good film but I wish Kirk had been a bit more upstanding character - I mean, the guy was a cheat, a womanizer, a maverick...geeezz...lol.   That's not the way I invisioned Kirk over the years.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@All<br>SPOILERS EMBEDDED IN COMMENTS - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br>@Ray<br>You didn't mention Scotty at all and I thought that he brought just the right amount of comic relief to a point in the story that could have gotten far too intense and nerdlike without him - he truly pulled in all of the casual movie goers with a couple of cheap laughs.  Plus they showed him before he became a lardas$!<br>The opener where Kirk's dad sacrificed himself to save the crew choked me up (I'm a true wuss).  It was the performances of Spock and Kirk really sealed the deal for me.  I am biased because I'm a huge fan of Sylar on Heroes so I expected a lot from Quinto and he delivered.  On a side note I thought that Urban played a middle aged Bones very well and his divorce line was a great little joke.<br>Finally, when you spoke of the intro were you upset about the lack of official music or the lack of the "space the final frontier..." speech?  The reason why they didn't open with the speech is so abundantly clear to me - they closed with it (right before the ending credits rolled) and the reason they did that was to show that the series of events (mainly the teaming of Spock and Kirk) that everyone had just watched was ground zero and that this would be a defining moment in the history of the federation and that the famous speech would become representative of the true mission of the Enterprise - after all it was a brand new ship.<br>BTW, I'm a huge fan of LOST and some of the other work that Bad Robot has done and as far as movies go this was their best outing.  I must agree somewhat with Scott on Cloverfield.  I wouldn't say that it sucked but they had a real opportunity during the scene where the military takes in our protagonists where the storytellers could have provided critical exposition which would've drawn members of the audience with IQ's over 90 into the movie.  I've heard rumors of sequels to Cloverfield so maybe part 2 will be a redeemer!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a note, I've never actually seen any Star Trek episodes. Maybe one or two as a kid, but I have no memory of that. I've definitely seen 10 second clips, just long enough to turn the channel, on television sporadically, but nothing memorable other than too-slow-to-keep-my-attention dialogue. Nevertheless, I had some friends that really wanted to see this movie, and it was playing at an IMAX, so I went.</p><p>Against all odds, I thought the movie was surprisingly good. Though plagued by horrible, awkward casting ( the 17 year old fingernails-on-chalkboard caliber accent guy, the guy from Shawn of the Dead? WTF!, and a completely arbitrary and trivial appearance by Winona Ryder?, I just felt confused as to why they chose those people, which was distracting ), I think that it was a pretty good movie.</p><p>One thing that always sabotages my interest in Star Trek and Star Wars is the set-in-the-future-but-with-the-industrial-design-of-the-early-1980's effect. I just can't take them seriously because all of the effects and style is so old-fashioned looking to me. The ship design made me cringe. The laser pistols made me giggle. The logo broaches made me really wonder why when some of the effects WERE really well done and visually impressive they couldn't have updated their renditions of technology and design to something on par with other contemporary movies.</p><p>But! Spock, Kirk, Spock's gf ( can't remember her name ), the captain, Eric Bana, they all owned their roles and it was a very enjoyable movie from the perspective of someone not at all interested or impressed with the original series ( or even very exposed to it ). The two non-geek girls I was with actually like it too, which is saying something.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not to defend the time traveling stuff, or the lack of back-story for the Romulans, but there is a graphic novel that covers the events in the future before Nero's ship gets sent back in time. The basic synopsis is that Spock knew it was going to nova, but couldn't get assistance to help. The comic covers where Nero got his ship, what Red Matter is, and the rest of it. Not to say that that is information that needed to have been covered better in the movie, but might help fill in gaps for those that are confused.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>First off, glad to see you cover the movie on your blog. I know you moved most of your Sci-Fi coverage to the forums, but for old-times sake it was good to see the post here.</p><p>SPOILER ALERT mode=On<br>One of the tidbits you didn't cover, that I thought was great was the Tribbles.  I don't know if you actually saw them, but the sound was in the background in the scene when Old-Spock and Kirk first met Scotty and his sidekick.</p><p>Another play off the old series was Scotty being beamed inside a container, and some of the other beaming "jokes" in the movie.</p><p>Inconsistencies that I found was: (1) Spock and Uhura's relationship, (2) Iowa was too flat (I grew up in Wisconsin and know that Iowa isn't that flat), (3) Iowa is flat, yet has a gorge drop-off?, and (4) I believe in "The Cage" (or was it "The Menagerie") episode that Captain Pike was still captain and in charge of the Enterprise (maybe this is one of those alt-reality deals because of time travel).</p><p>As far as characters, I wasn't as impressed as you with Kirk.  Young Spock (Silar) impressed me, mainly because he had no trace of his Heroes character present and was totally believable as Spock (excellent acting).  I thought the character that played Bones hit it pretty dead-on, almost too much so, and Scotty was definitely the most believable/dead-on.  Of course they were able to get Scotty's famous line in towards the end and some of Bone's lines also.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>*Spoiler included*<br>Totally agree with point 8--back story felt quite rushed and older Spock's relating of it seemed facile. A major planetary civilization and they don't notice a supernova? And they're only hope is one Vulcan in a little space ship who apparently was late because either a) his timing was a little off, or b) he stopped at the ihop on the way there? And actually I would have expects more from Abrams, considering the intricate and half-filled in mysteries he's woven with Lost, etc. Somehow, he seems resistant to bring that to his movie worked (I've read say as much). Too bad really.</p><p>Also, I think the reason black holes don't really show up in the original series per se is that because the science behind them doesn't really support their functioning as time jump portals. For their version of Doraemon's dokodemo door, Star Trek seems to favor the wormhole.</p></div>

Maybe he felt like he couldn't bring the same complexity in the time frame? I don't know, but this is a very good comment DH, so thanks for sharing it. I'm going to keep this in mind next time I see one of his films.</p><p>As for black holes and travel, well, every now and then you would have the Enterprise visiting some space doohicky for research. Kinda surprising you never see em visit a blackhole.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, I don't have a problem with the mechanical aspect of it - I think they could have hide the beer vats though. According to the Wiki - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStar_Trek_%28film%29%23Filming%3AY7_IgaA6SIrBzAMGUaD1vtzVXJU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(film)#Filming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a> - they filmed it in a Budweiser plant in Van Nuys. Not a huge complaint, just seems like they punted when it came to designing engineering. The Enterprise series had the most realistic engine room to date(IMO). Looking at the design of our own shuttle, I don't see much steel deck plating, I-Beams, vats of beer or concrete floors. J.J, must really love beer. An acceptable fault.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For people wanting The Wrath of Khan and the classic movies, I don't know about where you all are, but here in Australia stores are re-releasing them in new boxes remastered in a collection of 6 (incl. Wrath of Khan) for 100$, and individually for like 26/36$ last I checked.</p></div>
