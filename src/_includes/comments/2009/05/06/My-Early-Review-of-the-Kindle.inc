		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Kindle makes sense if you travel.<br>Think of carrying 1000 books with you on a plane.<br>But I've found that there's no need for it if you are sitting in front of an Internet-enabled computer.<br>If judged on its own, I consider it a modern marvel of a new information age.<br>And I think you're right in that it makes more sense for storytelling reading rather than computer manual reading.<br>I downloaded the ColdFusion developer's guide and reference manual to see if I could squeeze in an extra 15 minutes here or there.<br>Although it's less bulky than the 3000 combined print pages, it's not the same as flipping through the manuals with a yellow highlighter.<br>Still though, based on sheer volume, the Kindle is like carrying an entire library around in the palm of your hand.</p><p>Subscribing to rss feeds might be interesting, like BlogCFC.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd be interested in what you think of the Kindle Reader app on the iPhone (and/or Stanza) and how it compares to the Kindle.</p><p>I had a K1 and I had a K2, and also have Kindle Reader and Stanza on the iPhone. Of the three, I tend to prefer the iPhone. Obviously, since both Kindles were returned.</p><p>I can easily read text on the iPhone at one level below the standard font size, while the low-contrast screen (75% gray text on a 25% gray background) on the Kindle requires me to INCREASE the size up one level in almost any situation other than sitting outdoors in direct sunlight.</p><p>The result? At those settings one can actually see MORE text per page on the iPhone, even though the Kindle has a much larger screen.</p><p>I may get a DX since the much larger screen should be able to fix any font size issues. (And assuming that Apple doesn't come out with a large-screen Touch.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sounds like you had some wireless connection problems.  I have a first gen Kindle and an area well-serviced by Sprint.  Book downloads have always been flawless.  And this is a strength in that you don't need a computer.  BTW, whats the secret to losing 80 pounds?  That is an achievement!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It will actually be *easier* to read outside in bright sunlight. E-ink isn't backlit, it's very much like paper... that's why it seemed dim indoors. It's not going to get washed out. But you probably can't read it in a pitch black room (You can use the kindle reader app on the iphone for that)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Terence: Come on guy, those are just rationalizations. Diets aren't hard. Just eat more protein and vegies and green stuff (salads) and a lot less junk food (cookies and candy and chips and fries and so on). You know what's junk and what isn't. Eat less as well. Don't have to always finish the entire plate.</p><p>Then go to the gym and WORK, don't just wave your arms around. A diet, on its own, probably isn't going to do the trick. You need to burn the fat and build muscle, which in turn will make better use of the calories you do eat.</p><p>But you have to decide in your head that you're going to do it. Don't commit, and nothing will work, and nothing will change.</p></div>
