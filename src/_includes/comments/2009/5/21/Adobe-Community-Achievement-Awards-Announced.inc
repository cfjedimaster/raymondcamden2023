		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I was filling out the aforementioned survey I noticed that one of the selections was "best cf is not dead" article.  It reminded me of this guy that I'm sure many of you remember from way back...<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdavejlowe.com%2Fblog%2F2007%2F07%2F02%2Fcoldfusion-dead%2F%3AePqdxobBkzMc3r9IGxFogEtrBnk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://davejlowe.com/blog/2007/07/02/coldfusion-dead/">http://davejlowe.com/blog/2...</a></p><p>At any rate, I would like to point out that it has been almost 2 years since Dave wrote this and we're getting closer and closer to seeing yet another awesome version of our favorite dead language released with more cool features that allow developers to rapidly develop highly functional web apps.  Many of these features are flat out not available out of the box in the environments that Dave touted in his post as being superior to CF.<br>And speaking of Dave, it looks like he hasn't posted a blog entry since the day that he got a bit overzealous and went on the attack which resulted in everyone owning his arse on his own blog (that's like a rapper getting outdone by a guest rapper on his own album).</p></div>
