		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm an independent contractor too.  When they ask you for the "reasons you need to be excused", just word it in a guilt-filed fashion..."owner of my own, small business...if i'm not working today, the projects will be in jeopardy, and we run a great financial risk" or something to that effect has always worked with me.</p><p>Granted, it may be an hour or 2 before you GET to that point. So bring a laptop, or a book. :)</p><p>Good luck.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm in the same 'independent contractor' boat as you (an unknown length of absence is scary), I have gotten out of jury duty twice because of it (in CA).  The excuse they accept is "Self employed; Extreme financial hardship; Missed work is not reimbursed." or something that effect.</p><p>The first time I showed up in person and got excused within an hour, the second time I mailed in my excuse early and I never heard back (no news is good news).</p><p>Best of luck! Hang in there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I did the written excuse. They said they would mail me back if I was excused, but they have not done so yet.</p></div>
