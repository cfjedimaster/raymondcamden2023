That happens to all of us, right? We KNOW we should start with the Google check because someone else will probably have solved the problem before us. But it is just way more fun to do it yourself isn't it? Let's all keep playing!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, that's one of the reasons why it shouldn't be done.  When I reviewed the sample in Firefox, my browser crashed every time (possibly due to an add-on), but it worked fine in Google Chrome.  I tested this a couple of years ago using Internet Explorer too... but it can be hit or miss unfortunately.</p><p>I initially preferred FlashPaper for embedding, until I found out that you had to use an Microsoft Office plug-in to make hyperlinks or anchors.  (The PDF format had more options.)</p></div>
