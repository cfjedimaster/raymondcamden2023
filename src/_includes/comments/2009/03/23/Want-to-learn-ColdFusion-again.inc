		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think there are two key elements to learning anything:  A project and a deadline.  Without both, many people tend to languish and get caught up in information overload, and in  the end, not much gets acomplished.</p><p>So, to extend this to CF... create a simple database table containing dates and events, such as your next vacation.  Then create a web page that shows how many days until each event.  (e.g a grid with two colums:  days from now, and event)<br>Then create an editor so you can edit the table and secure it.   You have until friday to finish, or Monday we'll hire a new guy  to do it ;-) ) (just kidding, a little bit)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Adam, but you don't even have to modify existing code. Just run an example app and then read through the code and figure out how it is doing whatever it does. Start at the beginning: Application.cfm/cfc and index.cfm and just follow the flow to see how things happen.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Speaking of resources for getting started with CF, Ray had quoted Cody at the outset saying he'd read the "Adobe tutorial [which] focus[ed] mainly on developing with Dreamweaver". I'm guessing he was referring to a book that's definitely worth mentioning as a learning resource.</p><p>Called "Getting Started Building ColdFusion MX Applications", and included in the CF docs for 6 and 7 (but not 8), it's a great introduction to CF. At over 150 pages, it's neither too short nor too long, in my opinion. It walks through development of real apps (from a beginner perspective, obviously) and has lots of screenshots.</p><p>You can find it in PDF and HTML format at the CF 7 docs page:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsupport%2Fdocumentation%2Fen%2Fcoldfusion%2Fmx7%2F%3A4kDJBweFafVZOe2pMDqPQdIfOO0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/mx7/">http://www.adobe.com/suppor...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Depending how old-dated your knowledge in Coldfusion is, I suppose you can also look at the older books (CFMX7 Dummies, Certified CFMX7 Study Guide etc) to learn some basic stuff quick (again). For Coldfusion 8 are not too many books in my opinion, but the SMACK series seem to be good (haven't tried them yet myself).</p><p>I miss in the comments/Ray's list the Coldfusion User Groups and the Coldfusion Meetup on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Fcoldfusionmeetup%2F%3AITemqeQvtvmUBcMq1PZXn1Zh2H8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/">http://www.meetup.com/coldf...</a> . I saw some recordings and there are weekly new conference meetings via the website. Quite nice.</p><p>I have teached some people myself with the knowledge I have, but it's far from extensive as that you can learn from books etc. I still plan on dividing my blog (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnorway.weblogforyou.com%3AjO2OjHhsJV1nVWnnviKUQnmorYg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="norway.weblogforyou.com">norway.weblogforyou.com</a>) between private stuff and CF related, but haven't had the time for that yet (perhaps I should just blog on the Coldfusion blog site).</p><p>For me a projectsite has always kept me busy and wanting to learn more, do better etc. I just think of something that might be useful: a blog, a database website to keep track of your movies, a database website to keep track of addresses and contactinfo of friends/family, a magazine on coldfusion, a magazine on computer games, a webshop, a forum and whatever can come to your mind and then try to find the right resources for that. You will learn along the way and quicker than you think.</p><p>I started myself at a company that gave me books and Certification exams, but as coding I started with a forum whereafter several other applications for customers. Ever since I am just learning (+ developing) on a daily base.</p><p>I ran into this post actually while looking for more teachingmaterial for the people on my current project that need to do a crashcourse Coldfusion.</p><p>Also I'd like to say that next to Dreamweaver, which costs money, you can also look into Eclipse (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eclipse.org%3ATPp1nLtdOB677aeDvBFtCddJheQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>), an IDE originally for Java development. They have this nice plugin written for Coldfusion named CFEclipse on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfeclipse.org%2F%3A0UEMyb50HBf4rxxy6OT8UtuoNc4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.cfeclipse.org/">www.cfeclipse.org/</a>  (in my opinion better than Dreamweaver).</p><p>Perhaps my next project will be some sort of website with a good overview of tutorials hehe. or a lot of snippets and tutorials. I prefer actually to have a site full of Video Tutorials (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asp.net%3AGfy_e5Smf17Ul76PL952AJbP6wo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.asp.net">www.asp.net</a> was a good example, but that's annoying MS and not Coldfusion).</p><p>And looking at code can be worthwhile, but can also make you puzzled.</p><p>I wish you good luck!</p></div>
