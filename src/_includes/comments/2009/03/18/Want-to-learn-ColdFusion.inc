		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - Myself and Dave Gallerizzo wrote the Advanced ColdFusion book. This is not new material, it's been available to authorized Adobe training partners for years.</p><p>While lists, arrays, and structures are obviously not "advanced", the concepts needed to be covered in the Advanced curriculum since they are not covered in the 3-day intro course and the entire curriculum must flow together to some extent. Adobe (and other training partners) insisted that the courses could not be longer than 3 days in length which ultimately determined what topics got covered as well as the level of detail. Most instructors find it quite challenging to make it through the entire Advanced course within the 24 hours allotted. For example, we actually had two additional units that were written but got cut due to time restrictions -- a pretty good (IMHO) introduction to XML/XSLT and everything you never wanted to know about Flash Forms.</p><p>We also wanted to introduce CFEclipse into the course instead of using DW, but that idea was also nixed since the intro course taught DW and it didn't make a lot of sense to hit students with two different IDE's if they were taking the courses back-to-back. We did add a CFEclipse tutorial in our Moving to ColdFusion 8 course, however, and cover another 7 days of material through our AJAX and CF, Moving to CF, and Administering CF courses.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Maq: Please see my earlier comment. I can't correct broken links on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FAdobe.com%3AF-lEhjY67nEyMJ-Pxxz4lVWafuI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Adobe.com">Adobe.com</a>. Please report it to Kristen.</p><p>@Steve: Thanks for some background on this. I can see how covering everything under the sun would be a great challenge.</p><p>This may be kind of a dumb question - but can people like me use the docs to teach students? If I wanted to start teaching again (in my spare time), would I be allowed to charge people and use this as the curriculum?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great! I recently took the beginner course which has started my addiction to CF but was unable to take the Advanced. The course was worth while, but the curriculum is not the type that absolutely needs to be presented in a classroom. If I can find the course files then I should be able to crank through the advanced quicker than it took for the beginner course.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I teach a community college class in CF and something like this would be great to reference. I currently have a curriculum that I came up with on my own that is somewhat similar to this- let's face it intro material is intro material.</p><p>I've found in my experience though that such a wind range of students take my class: everything from students, continuing ed, seniors, and more, that creating material that everyone can get through in the time allotted is challenging.</p></div>
