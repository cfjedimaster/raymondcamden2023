		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't do much refactoring do you :)  I use this utility heavily, but never really on Selected Resources (thanks for the tip about selecting the folder)</p><p>I use the Workspace Scope (search all open projects) and the Enclosing Projects ( current project you are working with ).  Also the shortcut to this dialog is Ctrl-H (win)</p><p>What kills me about the search view is I can not for the life of me find out what the shortcut is to easily jump to the next (or previous match).  I know it is ctrl+K for a file search, but that doesn't work in the search view across multiple files.</p><p>Another thing that bunches my panties is the single file search doesn't start at the top when it reaches the bottom of the document so you have to remember to Ctrl+Home to start at the top before searching.  Ahhhhh!</p><p>If anyone has solutions for the last two questions, please share.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd also add that you can run a replace without using the "Replace..." button in the Search dialog:</p><p>Once the list of results is displayed in the search view, you can right-click on an item (or whatever you Mac guys do) in this view and both "Replace Selected..." and "Replace All..." will appear as options in the context menu. I find this to be more flexible, as you can Ctrl-click to highlight multiple specific matches, and also remove individual matches from the search results before performing the replacement.</p><p>The enhancements to the search view are actually one of the biggest reasons I prefer 3.4 to previous versions of Eclipse, as the individual "hits" for each file are displayed, whereas in 3.3 and earlier there is only a count of the instances found in each file, and no context is shown.</p><p>@Dallas, if the search view is active, Ctrl+. and Ctrl+, will move you to the next and previous matches, respectively. Also, regarding your question on the Find command (the single file search), you can check the "Wrap Search" box, which I think will do what you want (jump to the top of the file after reaching the end).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can also do this in Dreamweaver CS4 by setting up your websites in the site manager (they have to be saved locally). Then when doing find/replace you select the "Search entire local site." I use it a lot to check or change links.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>does anybody know if there's a way howto exclude directories from searching? Within my project folder there's a huge directory called "images". This should be ignored completely from going though, because it slows down the search processs... I'm missing an option "exclude subdirectories" within the search dialog.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ezra, the single file option was the trick.</p><p>Although, sadly ctrl + and - are not working for the search view. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the tip!  I never noticed the Replace button either.  I think this is a lesson in UI design.  If your users don't know a feature is there, it won't be used!</p><p>The "Replace..." button should have additional spacing to set it apart from Cancel/Search.  Also, the (mostly useless) "Customize..." button adds to the clutter making the useful button harder to find.</p><p>Only the positive side, Eclipse does get the button ordering consistent with the OS by putting the Search button far right on OS X and the Cancel button far right on Windows.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dallas, two things:</p><p>First, make sure you are using the correct shortcuts -- the "next" command is ctrl-period, and the "previous" command is ctrl-comma (from your comment, it looks like you are trying to use ctrl-plus and ctrl-minus instead).</p><p>Also, which version of Eclipse are you running? I typically run 3.4, where this behavior works as expected, but I just tried it in 3.3, and the results were inconsistent (e.g., focus was sometimes changed from the search view back to the editor, at which point the shortcuts no longer work). I note that under 3.4 these keyboard shortcuts are listed next to the commands in the search view context menu, whereas in 3.3 they are not...</p><p>@Juerg, you can restrict a search to a selection of directories/files by defining a working set. In Ray's screen shot of the Search dialog, note the "Working set" option in the Scope section -- click on the "Choose..." button, and you will be able to define a working set that consists of only the resources you wish to include.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you upgrade to Ganymede (latest version of Eclipse) the multi-file search is even better. It shows a break-down of each file in the results showing each line matched. This means you can review your search results more easily without opening each file and only jump to the files and lines you really need to.</p></div>
