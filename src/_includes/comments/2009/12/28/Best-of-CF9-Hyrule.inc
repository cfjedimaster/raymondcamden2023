		<div class="comment_text"><p>I prefer that style as well. I should have made it clear he supports both which is nice. (Well technically he doesn't do anything special for it - both end up in the same metadata.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First off thank you so much for taking the time to review my project Ray. After seeing all of the cool projects being reviewed I agree that I probably should not of submitted it. What is done is done though so I hope you will all take some time to look at the project. I have not added much code since the start of it because I have not really gotten any feedback and I could really use some to drive the project forward.</p><p>Also FYI - This framework is not really *based* on Quick Silver. I need to fix my descriptions. It was more of an inspiration for this project because of its annotion based properties.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great point guys - You don't *have* to use them as comment annotations. ColdFusion will extract the meta data either way, its just a preference for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>At first, I didn't care much for the comment annotations, but now I actually think it's a good way to separate "framework-specific" annotations from standard property attributes. So my preference would be keep the validation annotations in the javadoc style and standard stuff (like "hint" and "displayname") inline.<br>@Dan -- Hyrule looks really cool -- great work! I'll have to make time to play with it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Way to be late to this thread but... I do hate annotations. They are note *meant* to change the behaviour of the code but they actually DO change it. <br>(add a /** @output true */ to a function for  example)</p><p>They feel ugly and dirty as a Divine Brown to me.</p></div>
