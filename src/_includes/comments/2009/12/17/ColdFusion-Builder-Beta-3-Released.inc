		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ahhh! I started to learn .NET because the company at my day job uses .NET, but now I see this and I am happily playing around in ColdFusion again. 1/2 half of my brain absolutely loves ColdFusion because it is just so cool, and the other half wants to know what everyone around me is using.</p><p>I guess it will end up being like operating systems - best to know a few. I do kinda see ColdFusion as the OS X of development languages. Not as many people use it right now but it is awesome to use. Maybe it will be like OS X and if it stays on it's current track with Adobe start to build a sizable user base again. Hope so.</p><p>- The random brain dump of a new developer. (sorry) :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Syed,</p><p>There are many factors that one must consider in order to answer your question definitively.  If you can share your environment with us, that will help loads.  Or better yet, throw your question in the CFBuilder forum.  There are a bunch of people eager to help and share ideas in there (present company included).</p><p>It is my personal recommendation that any developers lucky enough to be running on the 64-bit goodness found in OS X or Ubuntu (or Vista...I feel sorry for you but it's okay. There's always Windows 8.  ;-) that you install CFBuilder as a plugin on a 64-bit version of Eclipse (3.5.1 or higher).  The performance is remarkable and with the right jvm settings, this installation screams!</p><p>CFBuilder Beta 3 now supports the 3.5.1 version of Eclipse, however, I am not sure yet whether Adobe will be shipping a 64-bit version of Standalone.  There are a couple of threads out on this topic and I opened up a thread in the CFBuilder forums to find this out myself.  If anyone knows, please share your comments in those threads.</p><p>Matt</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Syed,</p><p>You are definitely in a beautiful position then.  All you have to do then is download a 64-bit version of Eclipse 3.5+ for Windows and then install CFBuilder as a plugin pointing to the directory where your 64-bit Eclipse installation is located.  If performance is not sufficient with default eclipse.ini jvm settings, you can really geek out and tweak them to your hearts content.  Just make sure you know what you are doing before touching them.  ;-)</p><p>My $0.02 worth</p></div>

There are some prerequisites as you will learn (mainly, you must be running a 64-bit JVM) but it is not too difficult from what I gather.  With that said, please take a look at this link as I found the instruction straightforward and accurate:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flingpipe-blog.com%2F2009%2F03%2F05%2Feclipse-ide-for-64-bit-windows-and-64-bit-java%2F%3ATtuMEoMFB99oFUxa4hI9qho2rnk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://lingpipe-blog.com/2009/03/05/eclipse-ide-for-64-bit-windows-and-64-bit-java/">http://lingpipe-blog.com/20...</a></p><p>If you need any further assistance, please post your question in the Adobe CFBuilder forum section and I, and many others, will be more than happy to help you out (Though it is on my to-do list for 2010, I do not have a blog or anything of the sort at this time so this is the best I can offer right now :-).  I have Windows 7 64-bit running as a Boot Camp partition on top of my MacBook Pro so I am able to use VMWare Fusion to do it myself in order to help you out.</p><p>Oh, and ask Santa for a Mac for Christmas.  Your life will be much easier and you'll have more free time on your hands to do other things, like test Adobe Beta software, lol.  ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Joshua.  Are there any developers in here that remember the good old days of the ColdFusion Studio IDE?  I know I do.  Once the MX line hit the streets, the IDE never caught up.  As a result, I gravitated towards HomeSite+ in 2001.  It wasn't until the CFEclipse plugin was written that, given all of the "Eclipse IDE" hype back in 2006 and the fact that it was a huge hit in the Java world and I really liked the idea of the "plugin" concept, I decided to try out Eclipse.  I could not have been happier and I have not looked back since.  As soon as Adobe added Step Debugging to their Eclipse plugin feature set, I knew my life as a ColdFusion developer would never be the same.  Now that they have finally decided to bring back a true ColdFusion IDE for true ColdFusion developers, it will be like Christmas in Q2 or Q3 2010!  Thank you to Adobe and all of the folks that have persuaded Adobe to make this product a reality.</p><p>Resource hog or not, I welcome the ColdFusion Builder IDE.  I will happily pay the $100 or $200 because it truly allows me to live up to the RAD concept of ColdFusion application development.  It just makes my job easier and over time, if you give it the chance it deserves, I am confident you will, too.</p><p>If you have a minute, check out this link where it shows Macromedia ColdFusion 5 Studio being sold for $100 for Windows only and all of the features it had that we once had.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webhostingedge.com%2Fsoftware%2Findex.cfm%2Fsub%2Fproduct%2Fid%2F109%2Fname%2FMacromedia-ColdFusion-5-Studio.htm%3AK4d358EsDRI2jLS6DAvReqVYYUQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.webhostingedge.com/software/index.cfm/sub/product/id/109/name/Macromedia-ColdFusion-5-Studio.htm">http://www.webhostingedge.c...</a></p><p>Maybe ColdFusion Builder is geared more towards old timer ColdFusion developers.  But I am 26 and if that makes me an old timer, it would be an honor to be a part of that demographic.  The one thing that can't be taken away from the ColdFusion community is that we are always willing to help out anyone that is interested in learning ColdFusion and what it takes to become a ColdFusion developer.  If you want to use Notepad, Notepad+, TextMate, et cetera, more power to you.  We're always here to help you when you need it.</p><p>:-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If only Eclipse could support DW style snippets with key bindings and surroundings.</p><p>Being able to bind &lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype="cf_sql_integer" value="#...#"&gt;  To a key (CTRL+ALT+i for me), and then having the cursor sit between the two pound characters waiting for text, is insanely useful for me. I can actually type "contact.first_name", highlight it, press my shortcut and get &lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype="cf_sql_integer" value="#contact.first_name#"&gt;.</p><p>The best solution thus far for eplipse in general has been using "autohotkey" with the trigger text (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdomoconnor.com%2F2009%2F03%2F31%2Fcfeclipse-keyboard-shortcuts%2F%29%3AuQKtSUKvx2-FkEGsY5Z98FPgxXI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://domoconnor.com/2009/03/31/cfeclipse-keyboard-shortcuts/)">http://domoconnor.com/2009/...</a>  but that just seems sloppy and doesn't handle the "surround this selection" method of snippets.</p><p>I'd buy CFB in a heartbeat if I could transition my snippet workflow over to it by using proper key bindings.</p><p>-Brian</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Does anyone know if there is away to tell Cfbuilder to ignore certain syntax errors? <br>I have a .cfm page that looses all of it's color coding on the line where it thinks a syntax error is occurring, but for our application it is not.  we use mnemonics in cf templates that get replaced by an application builder that writes out (publishes)  the file to the client directory with the mennomic (~~) replaced by  read settings.<br>one example is like so</p><p>&lt;cfif chkEmail.PVTID EQ ~~002&gt; <br>	&lt;cfset priorVenue="here"&gt; <br>etc..</p><p>cfbuilder (not sure about cfeclipse) does not like the "~~"<br> and every line of code after the ~~ appears in black- no color coding.<br>i have unchecked "enable syntax checking" under Syntax checking in preferences , but that did not help.</p><p>i have this same question in the cfbuilder blog, but noone has responded.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian what i do is to create regexp to wrap "match" with custom content. For example, if you need to wrap values in update statement:<br>=(.*?),<br>---&gt;<br>=&lt;cfqueryparam value="$1" cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar"&gt;,</p><p>Still creating a snippet that can wrap up selction would be awesome.</p></div>
