		<div class="comment_text"><p>I want to add an additional comment: One thing that is done very well story wise - is how happy Jake is with his Avatar. The excitement, the joy, the pure happiness of just being able to walk - is conveyed very well by the actor. What makes this even better is that these scenes are with a CGI character.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I found I never had to make excuses for the movie because it was done with a lot of CGI.  It was just an entertaining movie with beautiful visuals, good action sequences, and an interesting, if not a little familiar story.  This movie really set a new standard for seamless integration of CGI and live action.  I must say I am really enjoying the new use of 3D in today's films.  The use of 3D to bring an added depth to the film and the avoidance of the typical 'in your face' 3D shots of the past is welcomed addition to movies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There were many scenes in the movie that looked like they had been intentionally toned down. To make it more children friendly I suppose. The movie seemed as though it was trying to find a middle ground between the intended adult and kid audiences, and I don't think it quite hit it.</p><p>I still holding out hope for the the directors cut.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, as you said the movie was visually stunning. But apart from that, I felt they could have added more Depth to the characters and to the Na'vi. I also think the movie could have been shorter. I get why they wanted to use Jake's character, but I was not a fan of his narration.</p><p>I also found it to sort of the the retelling of a "Natives vs Colonists" story.</p></div>

It was visually awesome!  I wish that the first 15 minutes of the story would have lasted 30 minutes.</p><p>I missed the "Bush-Bash"... good reason to go back and see it again.</p><p>Did anyone else get hit with a $4.00 upgrade fee?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I missed the Political Jab - bummer :)  As a parent of younger children I was glad they kept out the gore that really doesn't need to be there.  I was appreciative that a huge arrow going through someone was just that - a huge arrow.  Not some bloody, guts all over the camera horror show.  As a person who thinks it takes way to much to entertain people these days I was happy to be entertained with a fairly clean movie for a change.  I am sick of the assumption that we need blatant sex, the gouging of internal organs, and vulgarity in order to enjoy ourselves.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the two and half hours felt like 45 minutes.  I hope the rest of the trilogy is as good when it happens.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I give Avatar a strong 9 out of 10 overall. Special effects A++. I totally agree with Rey. The difference between a 9 and 10 movie is very subtle. A great movie (a 9 scale movie) will take you on an awesome journey. In an awesome movie (10 scale movie) there's something that sticks with you long after the movie is over. A would be Forest Gump, It's A Wonderful Life. Agree?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Being an avid Sci-Fi geek for over 50 years I personally thought that Avatar was an astounding movie visually, of course the story is based tightly on Pocohontas and the first American settlers and the Navi are very similar to the native American Indians, but who cares! every film producer or director will use the same story or story line, over and over again, an example of this is Star Wars which contains every cliche available, but it is still the best movie ever made.</p></div>
