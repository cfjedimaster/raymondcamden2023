		<div class="comment_text"><p>In my experience this type of hassle always seems to be a configuration problem that only the ISP (and their incompetent phone support techs) can resolve - meaning it is something on their end of the line.  Good luck talking to them and getting your issue elevated to the right person.  Personally, I have 2 routers that have been collecting dust for nearly 3 years because we've been on U-Verse and have had zero downtime since then.  The service uses the U-Verse gateway appliance that controls TV, VOIP and internet and it seems to work pretty well despite all of the gaming and everything else I try to throw at it.</p></div>

This is still pretty new to them, well, they've supported businesses in my area for a few years, but they are still new to the residential net/video/phone system. I don't mind "wasting" 50 bucks for a new hub - it may be worthwhile just to get the 8 port one - and if I have to call em I'll consider it growing pains of the new system.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I'd definitely fully investigate updating the firmware first.  Sounds like you have already looked at that though.</p><p>Also - I have found some routers to get EXTRA flaky when I have certain apps running.  Torrents and other P2P software that blast huge quantities of very small packets through your router can make it fall over sooner.  I have a WRT54G that died daily under load, but that is great now that I switched to Tomato firmware.</p><p>If you do go the route of buying a new device, I definitely second the recommendation for Tomato or DD-WRT.  Check and make sure any device you buy is compatible with one or both.  You don't have to install new firmware right away, but at least you have the option.  My experience with Tomato is great and it does ALOT more than the default firmware.  Some firmware also offers several VPN endpoint configurations.  Tomato specifically (in my experience) is worth looking into and really not that hard at all to install on the device.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I happened to have such problem with my Netgear router and here are few things which i learned:<br>1) switching to wireless N @5GHz helps because there are no interfering devices such as wireless home phone and bluetooth on that diapason <br>2) new Apple Airport Extreme works much more stable than Netgear with 3 internet hungry laptops connected at the same time. Looks like price of the device tells about it's stability under higher loads.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Might be worth taking the lid off to see which bit gets really hot...  I had a router recently that worked reasonably well - it was a crappy non-branded chinese thing, but worked - gradually it got worse and worse with my connection when we put more demand on it with streaming video, etc.  I think the problem boiled down to router "age" - the components were slowly dying and also the router was not upto streaming video...  There were a couple of caps that got really hot - should not really...  Anyway, it sounds rubbish, but check out where the heat comes from, people have recommended various fixes from beer cap heatsinks upwards...</p><p>Might be useful, might not so don't get too distracted :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have ComCast cable internet and used 2 different Linksys routers (Wireless G and a WRT54G both updated with latest firmware).   They both experienced the same mysterious issue as yours (DHCP dropping and not allowing a renewal until a reboot).   A tech from ComCast came over and tested the lines and the modem.  He stated that both were fine and blamed the routers.  I thought it "may" be due to my iPhone, but disabling WiFi on the iPhone and/or giving using a static IP didn't change anything.  I ended up going to Costco and purchasing a Belkin N+ router that was on sale during December.  I don't have any problems now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I too struggled with routers for a while until I made the move to a WRT54G router and installed DD-WRT on it. I have never had a single issue after making the move, and the thing runs forever without needing any reboots. So it's possible that it could be your router's fault as well.</p><p>I also tried Tomato, and actually installed it on the same router model at a friend's place. Excellent as well, AJAX interface, and a little easier to install because its installation file was smaller (the particular router has an initial limit set by its BIOS if I remember correctly, and I had to install DD-WRT in a two-step process - but this might have changed by now).</p><p>Having seen and worked with both, I prefer DD-WRT but that's just a personal choice. You can not go wrong with either of them. And as for wireless (you mention that your walls on the second level block the signal), one of the nice things about both of these interfaces is that you can adjust the strength of the signal to anything you want, bypassing the default set by most routers, making the signal strong enough to go through bomb shelters. I just make sure to turn the wireless off when the baby is home. :o)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Shimon - One of my the Linksys routers was G and the other was N.  The Belkin router is N and had some additional features that made it worth purchasing - Gigabit switch (not a hub) - USB storage port - DMZ mode - sticky DHCP IPs - Guest WiFi Mode (like access at hotels)<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fproducts%3Fq%3DF5D8235-4%3AwVXyPihSg76DNKplMSe_q5Mfl4c&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.google.com/products?q=F5D8235-4">http://www.google.com/produ...</a></p><p>Here's a link to the PDF guide:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen-us-support.belkin.com%2Fapp%2Fanswers%2Fdetail%2Fa_id%2F125%3AODktf79unOHITxDhqZt4hqxgPoA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en-us-support.belkin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/125">http://en-us-support.belkin...</a></p><p>I've used DD-WRT in the past with an older Linksys router and thought it was superior.  I unintentionally bricked it the first time I installed the firmware and had to open the case and cross some wires to reset it.  Other than that, it worked well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>And since I said things seemed better - of course it just died on me. I was going to head to Office Depot this morning, but changed my mind. I'm leaving in two hours so it's a bit too close. So I'm tempted to first try the DD-WRT route, see how that works, and then go buy hardware if I need to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey guys. I finally got around to buying new hardware. I picked up the Cisco RVS4000, which apparently is going to EOL May 1. Lucky me, right?</p><p>So here is the odd thing. Before I switched, I did a Speakeasy test. I saw DL speeds of 40mbs or so, uploads of 10 or so.</p><p>Now I see downloads between 10-20, uploads of 5. WTF. I thought maybe it was the VPN software, but I've turned off any VPN support. Anything else I should check or should I just return it?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, I switched to a DLink one and the speeds are much closer to what they should be. However, now I'm seeing something freaky. DNS seems off. If I go to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fx.com%3AFp25meIdNgOFObzUEq5G61fJpWI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="x.com">x.com</a>, and I've yet to visit <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fx.com%3AFp25meIdNgOFObzUEq5G61fJpWI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="x.com">x.com</a>, it is INCREDIBLY slow. Hitting <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fx.com%3AFp25meIdNgOFObzUEq5G61fJpWI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="x.com">x.com</a> again after it though seems speedy.</p></div>
