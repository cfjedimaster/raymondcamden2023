		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, my first question was going to be...does it have to be mine or just code I have to deal with?  Fortunately, I don't think I can compete w/ 5000 lines.  Anyone who suffers through that *deserves* a prize.  Maybe you should have made the prize that you would refactor the code ;-)</p></div>

Here's the thing, this system wasn't designed to support customizable forms. But we're customizing forms. So. yeah it's a hack. deal with it. otherwise i'm billing 100 hours to come up with some really drawn out solution that wil work better in the long run but in the near term will cost more money and therefore piss off everyone standing at the shrimp buffet ---&gt;</p><p>Sounds like JD was having quite a bad day when he wrote that!</p></div>

Every time someone has to revisit this particular script, it thoroughly destroys the rest of their month.</p><p>The company that originally provided us with this code literally employed dozens upon dozens of CF developers and turned them over quickly, so there's a myriad of different styles and patterns in the codebase.  Many of the patterns and techniques, I'm sorry to say, are a disaster! ;)</p></div>

I found them now using windows search ".cfc size:&gt;250KB"...Those that make me "proud" now for the first time ever are search.cfc of 6257 and then searchPublic.cfc which extends the previous with 1520 lines.
