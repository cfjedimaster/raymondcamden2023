		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great information. Great demo. Unfortunately I would never use a service to translate, and neither should any of you. I don't know how many of you out there speak other languages, but the translations won't make sense to your readers. It's so bad that even the most simple Spanish translation is incorrect.</p><p>Amateur softballs greatest - Softball amateur m√°s grande</p><p>Amateur is not even Spanish, and you don't say "the biggest\largest" to mean greatest.  Can you imagine translating 4 paragraphs about what your technology company does? The service can't even get 4 words right.</p><p>I tried it with Italian, even worse.  My point is if you do multi-language sites, get a real translator. You might think "It's better than nothing" - trust me it's not.</p><p>API is cool though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it comes down to setting expectations. I think if you set the expectation that the translation is automatic, then a reader would be warned ahead of time to expect some oddness, and therefore, imho, should be able to infer at least some meaning from the translation.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@papichulo: I agree that working with a technical site or a professional one, you should use human translation. That's what we, at our office, had to do on our European real estate websites (translated into 17 languages), sending the texts, variables, menus to human translators and spending a lot of money and time with that, but the final result is trustable.<br>I also agree with Ray when setting the expectations. If your website is informative and officially in only one language, I don't see any harm allowing the customers to have a quick pick or a ball park idea of the content in his/her own language. Most of the cases, you can have a good idea of the content.<br>@Ray: Good job and thanks for your continued help to our community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No doubt that a human translator is the solution for professional multilanguage site, but in a situation where the site owner has to load a lot of content (immagine an e-commerce with thousands of articles varying very often), in many languages, surely he cannot always ask for a human translator, in term of costs and time.<br>i think the solution is to write content in the original language in a simple and linear way so 'helping' the Goggle, or similar other, transalator.<br>salvatore</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes Ray, that's right. :-) Or a bookmark to a human translation bureau that charge $100 to have a page's worth of text translated within the hour. ;-) One of my sites provides important public notices so I've looked into translations and paying a bureau to do a rapid human translation. It's the only viable option to avoid embarrassing, misleading, or even offensive machine translations. Text that uses colloquialisms (figures of speech) are the most amusing (dangerous) when translated verbatim.</p><p>Your code has given me an idea of using mini country flag icons where you'd mouseover and the text would instantly Googlefy into the selected language. Temptingly cool, but dangerous.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good point, Paul. How about those split flag icons I've seen on some sites. e.g. half Canadian, half French. That illustrates Canadian French (or French Canadian!).</p><p>Otherwise wouldn't you just click on the native country that represents the language? e.g. France=French, Spain=Spanish. So if you are from Mexico you'd click on the Spanish flag.  You're probably thinking these people will be offended to have to click on a flag that is not of their own country? But I think everyone accepts the origin of their language and the impracticality of displaying 100 flags?</p><p>Or is a drop down list of languages in their native spelling(Espanol, Francais, etc) the only way to do it to keep all visitors happy?</p></div>
