		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Oddly I wasn't able to find any news coverage of this"</p><p>You won't see much of this in our little community, but I have found that Adobe is not a very popular company (from my limited experience).  We have a lot of Adobe fanboys in our community, but when I talk to other developers and IT people, I often see turned up noses at Adobe.  I think one reason is how absolutely horrible the Acrobat Reader is.  I think another is all the animosity towards Flash.</p></div>
