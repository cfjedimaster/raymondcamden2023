		<div class="comment_text"><p>It sounds like a fix should be added to MG for this.  Are cfc-based event types even supported anymore? If this could potentially slow down reinit it sounds like it should either be removed or default to *not* look for a cfc, and allow that feature to be turned on via a config setting.  I guess this is really an issue for the MG project, but it sounds like you're one of the keenest users of MG3 (and a member of the team). ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In theory a CFC based custom event _could_ be more powerful, so I could see the argument against removing it. That being said, I'm not aware of anyone actually using it.</p><p>To be fair though - the custom tag path pointing to 8000 files is a red flag. This is from the previous application and is part of what I'm trying to fix.</p></div>
