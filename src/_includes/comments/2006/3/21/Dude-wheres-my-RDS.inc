		<div class="comment_text"><p>ray - i was able to add rds support to eclipse thanks to the comment you added yourself to your original post.<br>another matter is: as much as i want to switch from homesite to eclipse, i have a hard time getting my head around the new gui and all it's features. like: why doesn't F12 actually do anything, etc...<br>my question is: do you know of any really good intros/tutorials on getting started with actually using eclipse, not just setup stuff?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Why is RDS so exciting? I use an app dedicated to writing queries and working with databases (ie Query Analyzer, Aqua Data Studio, etc.)- it seems to me its easier to flip to another application where I have more real estate to work with and flip back then have it all integrated. Am I missing something? I haven't turned it on in years perhaps there is something I forgot.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I prefer to see my db stuff in the same ide. It's just a preference. RDS also makes tweaking files online much easier. So for example, I have a config file for this blog. I can use RDS to quickly edit the config file w/o the normal "edit, ftp, etc" process.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There would be so much less confusion to say: get the ColdFusion Flex Builder extensions at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrials.macromedia.com%2Fpub%2Fesd%2Flabs%2Fflex2%2FColdfusion_FBExtensions_B2_0310.zip%3A96l81KYzkEykDEScPX5MNIgDRpQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://trials.macromedia.com/pub/esd/labs/flex2/Coldfusion_FBExtensions_B2_0310.zip">http://trials.macromedia.co...</a><br>and extract them into your eclipse directory. :)</p></div>
