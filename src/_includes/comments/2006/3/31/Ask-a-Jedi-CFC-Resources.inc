		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I'm still using CF5 to serve our company's main site, where I do most of my work. The site simply works well and there's no reason to upgrade it.  We are using CF6.1 on another server for our scheduled tasks and mailings, but those don't count as real applications.</p></div>
