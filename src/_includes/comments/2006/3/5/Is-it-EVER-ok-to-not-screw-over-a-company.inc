		<div class="comment_text"><p>I run surveys like these for companies quite often (except they're good surveys, and in flash of course). The worry with these kind of multiple entries isn't so much the cost - but the risk that they'll skew the survey with junk information. Anyone worth their salt will look at the IP addresses and screen out duplicates that way.</p><p>Also this offer is being spread virally - so they're getting a lot of survey entries and probably generating a lot of new customers for iTunes. I doubt anyone is getting screwed over as much as you might think at first glance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used to teach a basic business class at our local university.  In our business ethics section of the semester we would talk about business ethics, the reasons for it, laws, etc.  I had our open conversation time when I would ask students why it is important that businesses act ethically.  Students would answer "good PR" type of questions, but most struggled for an answer.  Very rarely did they say "because it is the right thing to do".  I was always surprised by that.</p><p>It isn't that they wanted to act unethically, but rather they don't have doing the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing on top of their minds.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I guess the question is moot.  If these people don't do it someone else will. Together, the whole lot of them act as a virus of sorts.  And what I mean by that is, they attempt (and do) exploit a system weakness and the system (at least a successful one) adapts and corrects the weakness.  In this case the survey costs a few more songs for results that are biased by the repetative surveys, so the entire application is a waste.  I look at this and think the 4 year olds are stupid people, but I also think the designer of the application should have done a better job.  But maybe that is too cynical.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>.... "Anyone worth their salt will look at the IP addresses and screen out duplicates that way."</p><p>You can't do that, unless you want to prevent multiple people using the same computer from filling out surveys.  Or people with dynamic IP addresses.  Or people using computers in computer labs at Universities.... etc, etc, etc.</p><p>As for it being "not worth ones time" you could probably write a CFML script using CFHTTP to handle that for you. =)  Combine that with a catchall email address and you're good to go.</p><p>My guess is that the authors of this survey thought of that already and really didn't care if 1% of the respondants fill out the survey multiple times.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It seems to me that there is really nothing wrong with people using multiple email addresses in this case.  The premise of the survey is one download per email address, not one download per person.</p><p>This means a family of four that shares an email address can only get one download.  But an individual with 4 addresses can get 4 downloads.  Those are the rules as set forth by the company.</p><p>In order to get your download, you must agree to recieving email from the company.</p><p>If the policy simply stated "One download per person", I would agree with you that this is cheating.  But these people are actually playing by the rules as set forth by the company.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree Fredo. I mean - you are right about their rules - but I think any reasonable person knows the -spirit- of the survey. Are you telling me the average person with N addresses would feel that the company really wants them to fill it out N times with the same data? Even if the company didn't spell it out - it's common sense (and common decency) I'd say.</p></div>
