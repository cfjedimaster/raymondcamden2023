		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah that guy in the medical place was the same as the "leader" of the others (the actor was in Dukes of Hazard, and I imdb'd him (don't bother seeing this btw)). Only he was without beard in this episode... that made me think... how the heck could he grow one so fast... BAM they show us some theatrical glue and a fake beard. So why would they fake a beard? To look like they have been living on the island for a long time (when in reality they have been chilling in the nice high tech facility). Also, I think they abandoned the bunker because they were afraid (rightly so) that claire would be able to find it again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anyone notice that the vials of medicine had the numbers on the label? Gotta love PVR with high def. I think the whole beard thing is weird. I think it has something else to do with them being on the island long. It's been at least 16 years that the others have been on the island. Remember Russo's daughter that helped Claire escape? Everyone of the others has been clean shaven for some reason, Zeke, Ethan, and the new Gale guy. I think that means something, but not that they haven't been there long. Also did you notice how Gale is trying to turn John against Jack, I think it's pretty lame that they are making it that John is very gullible. His dad screwed him over for his kidney, if that doesn't make you not trust anyone right away I don't know what would.</p><p>Bob</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wouldn't call Locke gullible. I think it more reflects how far he and Jack are apart in their views. Remember the conversation about Hemmingway and (that other author I can't spell)? I think that was a corollary to Jack and Locke.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One funny thing about Gale's question-- why would he direct his attempt to disrupt Jack and Locke's relationship at Locke instead of Jack? If Gale's purpose was just to be freed from the hatch, he should have tried to form a sympathetic relationship with Jack, who already didn't want him imprisoned. Instead, he seems to be trying to get a reaction from Locke, who was more in favor of Gale's imprisonment. So my reasoning is that Gale's major purpose is to disrupt the camp and its leadership, and not necessarily to get out of the hatch. On the basis of this I'm leaning towards him being an Other.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i think the guy ethan was talking to was the guy with the beard.  when they went in the medical place, it looked like there was a fight, everything was fliped over, maybe they saw that black smoke thing that reads peoples past.there probably at the other facilitys, theve already showed 3, just 3 more to go.the guy with the beard is gerald degroot, the girl who blew up the hatch was carrie degroot.  if anyone doesn't know how many bunkers there are, then u r the stupidist person ive ever met. notice when the button wasn't those hyhrogliphic signs, they said swd 3 caus die. what does swd stand for, what do u guys think?</p></div>
