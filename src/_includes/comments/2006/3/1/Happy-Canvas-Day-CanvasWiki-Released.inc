		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the items that always made me excited about Macromedia is the fact they didn't let the products in the DRK stagnate when it was obvious you wanted to release them. It would have been easy for them to just go "it's released". Instead, they allowed them to be supported out to the public (becuase of your interest is doing so I suspect). I think is was a whole "mind set" that there wasn't any loss in releasing your work (after a time), so why get in the way of the community. It's nice to see that Abobe has allowed all the work to complete this way, and it's an encouraging sign. :-) Plus, we get to recognize your briliance this way! Ahhhh! the light! it burns!</p></div>
