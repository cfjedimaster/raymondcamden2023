		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - YOU have to join World of Warcraft.  I left Star Wars Galaxies because they turned it into a first person shooter - totally suX0rs now.  I'm not hardcore gamer, I play maybe two hours a week tops and I'm already at lvl 20.  And I've only been playing little over a month.  Tons of people to play with, excellent game play and plus, everything looks enchanted.  The best servers to play on are PvP (player vs. player), but it sucks being ganked by a lvl 50 Tauren.</p><p>I could see you going either Night Elf or Dwarf, not too sure what your profession would be...maybe druid if you went Night Elf.</p><p>And oh yea, Eff the Horde and long live DarkIron!  Where's my holodeck?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>You coded a mud?  What codebase?  I used to code a mud run on Smaug, which is a variant of DIKU for awhile.</p><p>In regards to MMORPG's being used for social change, I sometimes startle myself in regards to what I'm willing to do in the "Game" because it isn't real.  Take the XBox game "Fable" for instance.  There's this one method of easy experience by using a feature, not really cheating.  If you entice one of the female citizens of the main town up to your balcony in your house, you can use basically smack her around forever, she won't die because it's a function of the town rules, guards don't see, and you get major experience points.   Oh you turn massively evil, but that is rectified by a donation to the temple.</p><p>The danger is when someone might consider applying the rules of an imaginary universe on the real world. I think the more that someone plays with MMORPG's, the more likely they are to gravitate towards Solipsism.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chris, it's been a while, but I believe I worked on LPC MUDs. THe last one I worked on was Everdark. I actually built some very nice stuff there. My realm had time, and rooms that would change based on time. I was also big into interaction, so I wrote a NPC class that allowed for easy conversations. You could do stuff like this: ask("bush","The president is a weenie ya know.");</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used to code LP MUDs.  They were the best from a code point of view.  It was really object oriented as in each object in the game was a program.  Diku muds had better game play, but he coding wasn't as interesting.  Games like Everquest are essentially a mud with a grapical interface.  It even uses the same commands as the muds.</p><p>As far as social change.  Here's a link to a dating site for people who play MMORPGs.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mmodating.com%2F%3ATF8gwtKgM-Z4lKvuHfCeoIxs_4k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mmodating.com/">http://www.mmodating.com/</a></p><p>There are also sites to find a date in a MMORPG.  Mind you not to date the player, but to have your on-line character date their on-line character.  On-line in game character marriages are also common.</p><p>The holodeck would be the last invention of mankind.  No one would ever leave.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The success of World of Warcraft has a great deal of attention as to why it is addictive.  The game presents an interesting method to catch the attention of its audience.  The presentation, delivery and content draw people of all ages. The information presented is neat, progressive and easy to navigate.</p><p>Now, imagine a progressive education system adopted the practices of MMORPGs or specifically World of Warcraft, delivery of information would be absorbed at rates that would astound you.  If you ask a World of Warcraft veteran, they could spout hours of information about the lore of the virtual realm.</p><p>Imagine an MMORPG that is based upon real history of the napoleonic war that has the stickness of World of Warcraft?  I bet you people would talk hours on end on the reasons why Napolean won and lost.</p><p>On the geek side of World of Warcraft, the UI is XMl based and has a scripting engine that allows you directly modify most of the interface through the use of LUA files.  So, if you enjoyed the MUD (Multi-User Dimension) aspect of coding, you can continue this trend, but cannot change the realm iteself as you could then.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If anyone is actually interested in a historical/legend based mud that is unintentionally, but truly, educational, then you should look up Legend MUD.  All of the realms are based either on what actually existed in history or (more often) what people thought existed at a moment in history.  The game is divided into three separate eras: ancient, medieval and modern.  Travel within an era is by foot, horse or boat, and the geography is similar to an abridged map of the world.  Travel between eras is accomplished through simple time travel quests.  If someone were to come up with a successful graphical version of this premise, it would be a boon to people's knowledge of real life history, legend and myth.  As it is, it's a fun game to play even without pictures.  :)</p></div>
