		<div class="comment_text"><p>One thing I noticed during the 'Previously on LOST' segment.  When they showed Sun being 'kidnapped', you can clearly see Charlie's bracelet on the left wrist of the 'kidnapper'.  Granted, I only noticed it because we know it was Charlie who 'kidnapped' her.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In the previews for the next episode, we see that Sayid, Ana Lucia, and Charlie do come across a yellow smiley-face balloon in the area of the jungle that they're searching.  But if you ask me, that doesn't prove that Gale is an authentic survivor. He could quite easily be an Other just using some other dead sod's balloon as a cover story. The only way for him to really prove that his story is genuine is... umm... uhhh... what does everybody else think? Is there really any way for the survivors to be sure that he's not an Other?</p></div>
