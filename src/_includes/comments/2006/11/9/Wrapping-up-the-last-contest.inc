		<div class="comment_text"><p>Contests are good, but the last several have gone beyond "find a clever and elegant way to do X" to "build a fully-functional application". The former is a brain-teaser, the latter a lot of work. I'd only be willing to take the time to build an application if I could see a benefit beyond the scope of the contest. I suspect (without any proof) that the recent contest entries were projects that the authors were either already working on or were considering doing anyway.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree another beginner's contest would rock, I would totaly get into that. As you see I'm so new to ColdFusion I think you should have a "Hello World" contest, hehe J/K. But really a beginner's contest would rock.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I think the contests still have value, even if there is not much participation.  As Joel mentioned, this one required a lot more time commitment that many of us don't have - but at least for me, it gave me a couple of good ideas that I've had on my to-do list forever.</p><p>And, as you mention, the community now has two more cool apps that we can use to our benefit, should we want to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Would it be possible to have a contest that had multiple levels?  So that a beginner could do X, intermediate X+Y, and advanced X+Y+Z?</p><p>Could the contest be for an app that was so relevant that nearly anyone could find the time to work on it?</p><p>Might it solve our current world crises and produce a lasting peace? Or at least stop the Cylons?</p><p>I should give an example to illustrate what I mean (I am NOT suggesting this as a contest by the way):</p><p>Beginner: Code to document a CFC<br>Intermediate: Code to document all CFCs in an app<br>Advanced: Code to document all CFCs in an app and list dependencies</p><p>/ejt</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree, building a full blown application is too time consuming. Mini-apps or functions would be more apropriate. Mayabe hold a contest for larger scale projects a couple times a year and give 4-5 month timelines, with a substantially larger prize (or a "featured" spot on RIAForge)?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me it's simply a lack of time, not interest.</p><p>Another idea would be to create the best extension to an existing open sourced application (hopefully in RIAForge). That way the scope of work would be smaller, but the end result could be more interesting, and hopefully useful.</p></div>
