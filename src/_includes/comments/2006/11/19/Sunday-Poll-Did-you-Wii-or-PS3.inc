		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't pick up either.  I thought about trying to get my hands on one or the other to put on ebay, but figured it wasn't worth the trouble.  I was just at the mall an hour ago and walked past the Game Stop and thought about going in to check to see if they had any left but figured there'd be no way.  Then as I was walking out I noticed someone buying a Wii so I walked in and asked if they had any left and they told me that was the last one.  Oh well.  I watched some of the games at the Wii kiosk and they looked pretty slick.</p><p>Hoping for a PS3 some day - maybe if I can get my hands on it for about $450 I'd _think_ about it.  Maybe...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A nephew offered to pick up an extra Wii for me last night, which he'll drop off on Thanksgiving.  Will be nice to have Wii Sports to help work off those extra holiday calories!</p><p>If you haven't played a Wii yet, you really should.  I got to play one a couple weekends ago at a tech conference here in Seattle.  My favorite Wii Sport game was bowling, which was pretty intuitive with the Wii remote.  Boxing was definitely the best workout.  Unfortunately a vlogger captured the tournament on video, and I'm dreading how stupid I'll look... the one major downside of the Wii.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great post Dan. For me its all 3! The controller looks great and everywhere I have read many say how intuitive it is. It's really nice to see a low price too and availability as I wouldn't mind getting a PS3 but why kid yourself when you know you will never find one for the next several months. Big props to Nintendo for going the right way not only making something affordable but that I can actually buy at this time of year. For now its definitely the system I plan to buy.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got a chance to play with one last week (a friend was evaluating one for a magazine article).  We had a lot of fun with the sports games.  We hooked it to a projector so boxing was really interesting.  I would say it was also the weakest of the games.  My wife was sore the next morning from taking Tennis too seriously. ;-) Zelda was beautiful, but not very exciting for a group to play. It would certainly be a must buy if I got the system though.</p><p>For me the controllers were the selling point.  The games were much more engaging.  Good graphics don't make the game (though they certainly can help).  I am REALLY surprised that it doesn't play DVD's though.  I know it will sometime next year, but still.  Not sure if I will get one but props to Nintendo for not directly competing with Sony and MS.</p><p>I just don't see myself getting a PS3.  Maybe the 360 so I can hook it up to my media center and take advantage.</p></div>

Interesting factoid: MoM was designed by the same guy that did Archon (which was also a favorite of mine.)

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had an Applie IIe until 1994, and that is all I played as far as computer games.    I played castle wolfenstein, and Archon, both very cool games for their time.  I started with the atari 2600 and a coleco.  Actually I had the coleco first, and later got an atari attachment so I could play all the atari 2600 games.</p><p>I bought an orginal playstation years later after it had been out.  I only bought 2 or 3 games for it and then I didnt play it much anymore.  It is currently sitting in my storage shed in a box.  I looked into the XBOX, but couldnt justify buying a new console due to the fact I wouldnt play it much.  I wanted the PS2 only for Metal Gear Solid 2.  Again, I didnt think that was a good enough reason.  So now that PS3 and Wii is out, im thinking of buying one.  Lets just hope i dont come up with an excuse to buy one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ha! That screen shot of the Atari 2600 Bball game sure brings back memories. My brother and I had some classic duels on that game. I wasn't sophisticated enough to get into those C64 games others have mentioned. It was Atari 2600 all the way in my house! Missile Command was another favorite.<br>As far as the consoles these days -- Heck, I barely have time to spend on the PS2 I got as a gift a couple of years ago. Besides, I just can't see spending over $200 on a game console ($600 for a PS3 ???!?!). Guess I kind of grew out of the whole gaming thing. Eventually I guess I'll have to deal with it when my 3-year old gets old enough (by then I'm sure I'll be plopping down a few G's, I'm sure).</p></div>
