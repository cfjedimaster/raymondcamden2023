		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not a bad episode.  The 'bad' part was hearing that this was the last episode for 3 months...no new episodes until sometime in February when they will show 16 shows in a row, no repeats.</p><p>And the big 4 'networks' in the US wonder why we are leaving them in droves, downloading their shows/movies on the computer, watching cable, surfing the web, etc.  Why we are giving up on their networks.  Well gees...what do they expect.  What kind of business gives their consumers what they really want, interspersed with crap (repeats) periodically, and then out of the blue just withdraw the product and tell their customers to wait 3 months for their fix again...but it will be worth it.</p><p>If they want us to 'buy' their products and watch their advertisements they have to deliver them.  Withdrawing their products makes us move on to different brands (maybe not theirs) and new forms of entertainment.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ryan - I feel your pain. But this isn't limited to the big networks. Look at the Sopranos. :) Also - this break wasn't really sprung on us. It was public knowledge. Almost all the fans knew it already. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well I hate the break, at least their trying to fix it. Instead of running new episodes periodically, they decided to split the season into 2--each running consecutive new episodes. My understanding is next year they plan to run the entire season together. I just don't think they had the time to do all the writing, filming and producing to do it this year.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I still don't understand the long break.  I don't recall this with other big three network shows.  I thought Anna-Lucial would have been in a flashback related to Freckle's husband work.</p></div>
