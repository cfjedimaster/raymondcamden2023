		<div class="comment_text"><p>I stopped reading comics around '91, and then picked up again when Joss Whedon launched Astonishing X-Men. I went through a rabid reading period for about a year after that, until I started to notice:</p><p>(1) Monthly comics are just too damned expensive<br>(2) I can't follow a story that comes out in monthly (or longer) increments anymore. (Planetary, the pain you cause me!)</p><p>So I'm switching over to 100% trade paperbacks. I gave Amazon their $79 for free shipping, and they keep a steady stream of books flowing to my door.</p><p>What's the best stuff you've read since your "return"? The highlights of my current library:</p><p>Tricked (Alex Robinson)<br>Blankets (Craig Thompson)<br>Absolute Planetary (Warren Ellis)<br>Sleepwalk (Adrian Tomine)<br>Black Hole (Charles Burns)<br>Lost Girls (Alan Moore)<br>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall (Bill Willingham)<br>Global Frequency (Warren Ellis)<br>The Walking Dead (Robert Kirkman)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with you on the cost. I'm mainly reading the Ultimates now. Walking Dead is darn good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm particularly fond of Ultimate Spider-Man.  It highlights one of the positives regarding the Ultimate titles - it's much easier to catch up on the continuity backstory.  :-)</p><p>Though I do enjoy some of Marvel's primary universe as well.  New Avengers has turned out well (written by the same guy behind Ultimate Spidey - Brian Michael Bendis).</p><p>Ray, Marvel Zombies is recommended, given your appreciation of The Walking Dead.  Doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's a fun zombification of the Marvel Universe.</p><p>A shameless plug.  If you're big into collected editions (trade paperbacks, hardcovers), as well as original graphic novels and manga, I've been working on a new pet project as of late.  The Graphic Novel Archive (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.graphicnovelarchive.com%3ABXskWrDtkV5CToiKUUMz4iFzSnM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.graphicnovelarchive.com">www.graphicnovelarchive.com</a>).  A work in progress, but I've indexed 6000+ graphic novels (using the broad definition) thus far.</p><p>Partially powered by the wonder that is BlogCFC, I might add.  :-)</p></div>
