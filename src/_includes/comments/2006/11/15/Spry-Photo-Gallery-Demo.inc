		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just a comment, but you'd need to fix the "previous" and "next" issues when you're at the ends of the list.</p><p>Also, it needs to have something to highlight the image that you're viewing at the moment as you can't tell how far through the list you currently are.</p><p>It's a fantastic idea though, just needs some implementation upgrades.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray</p><p>I love to paint and used to utilise the simpleview galleries form images of my paintings etc. Recently I decided to add a plugin to my blogCFC to automate the process of creating galleries and uploading images via an admin console, using Don Booths spry gallery.</p><p>This plugin needs alot more work but the bones of it are there.</p><p>Check it out - be cool to know if anyone else has done a more advanced version. Thanks Jose ;)</p></div>
