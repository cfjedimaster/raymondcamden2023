		<div class="comment_text"><p>You may want to mention that the NFL player was Chicago Bears' cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., and not one of the Manning's that we've actually heard of, such as Peyton Manning... 6'-5", 230 lbs., with a laser rocket arm. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As both a jock and a geek, I'd like to hear both sides of the story. Where is the original link with specifics about what Manning actually did? That article has no specifics, and I was not there to get both sides of the story.</p><p>As far as the suspension. Has anyone here ever been suspended by their employer for something they did outside of their workplace. that had nothing to do with their employer's business?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Frank, there are plenty of cases where someone gets laid off because of something they did outside of work.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think being suspended is getting off much easier than any of us would. Like Ray said, plenty pf people get laid off for things they do outside the work place. Manning is probably lucky (well not really because I think he'd have to kill 10 people to get fired) to have his job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the link. The exact details on everything I read had no specifics. One of your two links had actual details.</p><p>"According to a report in the Chicago Sun-Times, Los Angeles Police Department detective Robert Lewis said a group of people -- including Manning -- attacked a man in a Denny's after teasing him for working on a laptop computer."</p><p>You'd figure that when you're getting millions of dollars, you'd figure out how to avoid situations like this, but apparantly not.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Somebody mentioned that beating someone up or getting beat up is not the end of the world.  True.</p><p>But I think the report is that not only Manning (a husky football player) repeatedly punched and kicked the guy, and other people in his entourage did the same.  I don't know about you, but that would not be fun.</p><p>That's pretty horrifying.  Even those of us who are jock-ish, would not be able to take that kind of abuse and would be traumatized.</p><p>He's certainly getting off extremely lightly.</p></div>
