		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't take this personally but I don't like the layout of your blog at all. There's so much richer functionality in Flex, to keep the UI consistent and even a modicum of design would help. For instance, Categories of Blogs seems to be a parent of the Blog Entries and yet it's laid out on the left. Unless you're from the far-east this is not the way I'd do it.The Light Gray to Dark Green background coloration doesn't go with the blue application theme.There's nothing wrong with being a bit more verbose in your Panel Titles e.g.: 'Todays Blog Entries'. The search box is handy but it shouldn't have a place of prominence, it should be accessible but not stealing desktop space from the main app. Show All is not readily apparent what it shows on any of the panels... (I know it shows all of the blog entries, it is just not apparent from the buttons!).</p></div>
