		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray...I've got another off-topic recommendation for you.  Get your company to pony up for a Sprint (or Cingular) PCS data connection card.  The new ones connect at broadband speeds and they're only about $60 a month.  As long as you've got a cellular signal, you can get on the internet.  If you're able to offset six nights of broadband connectivity in the typical hotel by using the card, the service is paid for.  Then you'll have connectivity the next time Cox says your wiring has gone bad.  We use the cards at my company and we're very satisfied with the service (particularly the newer models which are fairly speedy).</p><p>Good Luck,<br>M. McConnell</p></div>
