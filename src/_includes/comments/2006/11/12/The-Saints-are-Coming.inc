		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm a Green Day fan, an LSU alum and lived outside NOLA in Gretna for a few years as a kid.  I've been a lot of places since and have been in Baltimore for 6 years after leaving Baton Rouge, but southern LA is an area that I still care about a great deal. I liked the song when they performed it before the MNF game at the Superdome and I like it now.</p><p>This statement is bigger than just Katrina and its victims, but people deserve an awful lot more than they get sometimes.  It's still heartbreaking to watch clips of what so many went through so unnecessarily.</p></div>

They sang The Saints Are Coming in the second encore (if I remember correctly), Sunday Bloody Sunday came about 3 songs earlier and the two of them together just sent shivers down my spine.</p></div>
