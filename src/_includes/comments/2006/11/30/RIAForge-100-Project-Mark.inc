		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hint for those posting projects to RIAForge - don't double host the zip on your blog and RIAForge like I did - it's much more fun to watch your project download stats go up on RIAForge!  I'd probably be in 2nd place if I didn't double host the zip ;)</p><p>Besides the obvious fact that folks who come across the zip on your blog will not be getting the latest version (which is part of the whole beauty of RIAForge).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - Even you "hacky" stuff is better than I have seen in some COTS packages (grin)...  We use lighthouse predominantly in-house for development tracking, but something like RIAForge would give us a more "cross-department" venue (graphics dept, CF Group, newly forming FLEX group, etc)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be honest, I am working a "side-project" in my "spare time" to see if I can't find a way to integrate Lighthouse, BlogCFC, and a couple of your other apps into 1 "portal-style" (single logon, mutli-app) framework.  If I succeed in that, you can expect several items on your wishlist appearing for you. {grin}</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Amazing job Ray - it is very cool.</p><p>Quick question. I have a couple of pure CF projects that I'll be poting (LightWire is already up there), but I also have another project: LightCSS. It is  lightweight CSS framework and while I think it'd be useful to CF developers, it is a little outside the boundaries as it wouldn't be built using Adobe technologies.</p><p>Just thinking out loud, while it'd be nice to be able to put it on RIAForge, if that was allowed we'd probably end up with JavaScript frameworks and all kinds of stuff. Might be OK, might be annoying/a mess.</p><p>My question is should I post it to RIAForge? And I guess my backup (if the answer is a no which it probably should be) would be to add a little CSS generation Wizard in CF which would then make it "built with Adobe technologies"!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks, no rush! I'm just about evenly split as to whether it would be cool to have sections for JS and CSS frameworks so this would be a one stop shop for Adobe developers (hey, we all need CSS and JavaScript) or whether it should keep more tightly to the clear mandate of "built with Adobe technologies" so it isn't a one stop shop for web developers but it IS "everything Adobe".</p><p>I don't think it would do much harm to have a couple of categories for supporting frameworks and it would be yet another reason for people to use the site - perhaps even introducing people who don't use Adobe products to the site and the possibilities of CF and Flex and the like. On the other hand I would get the argument that it should just keep its focus on exactly what it does and what it is about.</p><p>Will be good to know one way or the other once the decision has been made!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If I could offer an opinion on this, one of the things that is hardest in any project of this nature is trying to maintain focus. For instance on my open source list, I kept getting requests to add open source and free projects that support ColdFusion development, like CFEclipse for instance or for projects that were purely in the planning stages. I think one of the things that has kept the list useful is that, while many of these projects are very worthy, I chose not to include them so that I could keep the mandate of the site narrower and thereby more focused on meeting a specific need.</p><p>While we do all need CSS, JavaScript and other supporting technologies, I think hosting a purely CSS or JavaScript or otherwise project would be a mistake. That is not to exclude projects that use an Adobe technology like ColdFusion for instance to integrate these items (for example, much of AjaxCFC is a set of JavaScript functions, but there is also a component to ease integration).</p><p>I think the mandate of RIAForge as it exists is plenty broad since there is such a wide array of Adobe products. I think broadening this further would just create a mess. For example, why not a pure Java project which I might want to integrate with CF but which itself includes no CF integration? My point is that it is a slippery slope and RIAForge could end up just another SourceForge, hosting anything and everything.</p></div>
