		<div class="comment_text"><p>The girls name is Juliette, Ray. The funeral wasn't that weird, it was like in ancient times when the didn't bury them, they put them on rafts and burned them. I disagree with you on Juliette's message to Jack. I think it's a coup attempt within the others and some want Ben ousted but are afraid of him as I think he has the friendship of some of the more aggressive others.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I agree with you that Juliette is still manipulating Jack, although we've seen at least two scenes where she has been at least mildly confrontational with Ben, so maybe she's the more "evil" of the two and is just trying to get Ben out of the way; he found out about his cancer several years ago, so why were his X-rays just hanging around where Jack would just happen to see them? I can't believe that Eco is dead - he was my favorite character! And now they're trying to add these two new schlubs from the beach to the cast?</p><p>But you didn't mention the worst part of this episode - they said that next week is the Fall season FINALE! Meaning that we get to have another six month "hiatus" like last year! I'd like to set ABC on fire and put them out to sea! Argh!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh wow, check this out:</p><p>"Lost" producers hope a re-run free split season will help redeem the series and bring viewers back. "Lost" will run for six episodes then break for 13 weeks, returning with 17 more episodes to be broadcast without reruns. The network will compensate the advertisers by running extended versions of the episodes in a straight run following the completion of the third season. The extended versions will add additional footage into the season three episodes in an attempt to lure die-hard viewers back for another look.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buddytv.com%2Farticles%2Flost%2Fis_season_three_the_last_chanc.aspx%3ApHQXa27rmUZPwramsSNX63IYAss&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.buddytv.com/articles/lost/is_season_three_the_last_chanc.aspx">http://www.buddytv.com/arti...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm beginning to wonder if Ben isn't really the "good" one of the leaders. I'm beginning to think Juliette is way more manipulative than what we're lead to believe.</p><p>I really hope they get into what the "smoke" is. Also, I'm wondering if the image of Eco's brother was real (just someone who looked like Emil) or whether it was the cause of the smoke. They made a reference earlier about how Juliette was chosen 'cause she looks like Jack's ex-wife. This got me wondering if some of the "ghosts" people have seen have been just "Others" who look like their dead loved ones...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea, they need to kill the split season idea.  "24" did after their third season and have run each of the last two without interruption, which is really nice (not to mention the two-night, four-episode binger they kick the season off with...talk about getting the ball rolling!).  I know from some cast interviews that it messed up the production schedules, but they felt catering to the fans for the season was best.  Unfortunately, the exchange means that from approx. May through January you get nothing, but it's worth it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just a thought on the Black Smoke, but did any of you read "Prey" by Michael Crichton?  In their the swarm of tiny nano-objects could take the form of human's.  This could explain the smoke.  It may not be smoke at all, but a swarm of nano-objects like in Prey.  Just a thought.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Andrew, I'm with you.  The only commonality between Juliette and Jack's ex (actress Julie Bowen from "Ed") is that they're both blondes.  I mean they're both attractive, of course, but similar?  Not even close.</p></div>
