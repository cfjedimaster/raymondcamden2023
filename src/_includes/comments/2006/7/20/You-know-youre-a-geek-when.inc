		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've always wondered why "channel playlists" don't exist.  It would be great to be able to hide certain channels in the guide...  have a "sports list" for game days, "movie list", etc..  Not sure how everyone else is set up, but Time Warner Columbus puts all of the HD channels in the 700s, so it makes guide surfing between non-HD/HD channels a bit of a pain, since regular digital is 100-300..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, good to know I am not the only one who actually goes through all the menu options in the cable box! <br>I don't know what I would do without a DVR these days!  I have stopped channel surfing almost completely.  If I happen to find something on cable that I do want to watch that is coming on "live", I will actually set it to record and go do something else so I can watch it later without commercials!  <br>Oh, and off topic a bit, i see your still working out the kinks in your spam filters, eh Ray?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ryan: My Dish Network boxes let me set up multiple "channel playlists". All you have to do is click the Menu button more than once to cycle through them. "All Channels" and "All Subscribed" are setup by default.</p><p>@Ray: Confirmation for Delete is a good thing when (a) your friends' kids are over, (b) your parents are over, or (c) you've had a bit too much to drink. :D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I agree with you.  It is frustrating not being able to hide channels from the up/down selections.  There is no way I watch the 175+ channels I get on my Time Warner DVR...maybe 20 in the sub 100 range and 4-5 of the military/science/G4TV and then a half dozen HD channels.</p><p>As a side note, if you are only looking at the menus normally visible you may be missing a lot.  My Scientific American 8300HD box (time warner) lets me see the Linux info, boot times, hard drive space, etc.  Go to channel 611.  I wish there was a defrag button :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - not being able to block out channels is one of my biggest frustrations.  TV's can do it.  VCR's can do it.  D*.* can do it.  Why not the cable company?</p><p>Ryan - your 8300HD does have a defrag button.  It's labeled Power.  It defrags when it is "off".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I do the same thing with TiVo - menu surfing, that is - but your first bullet was interesting to me.  My TiVo boxes just recently *removed* the delete confirmation.  Instead there's a 'Recently Deleted' folder that works, in essence, like a recycle bin.  Like you, I always hated the delete confirmation so this is a tremendous step forward, I think.  And I don't have to manually delete things from the deleted folder.  TiVo takes care of that for me.  Cool.</p><p>About once a month it seems TiVo surprises me with something really cool.  And a couple of times a year, maybe, it surprises me with something singularly unpleasant.</p></div>
