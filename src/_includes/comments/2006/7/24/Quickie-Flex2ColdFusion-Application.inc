		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very cool Ray.  I love it when you give working examples with your code.  Flex is definitely making a case for itself, and I like how you show how easy it is to get started with it.</p><p>One question, the view source thing.. is that something that you can control, or is it just always available to all flex apps?</p><p>One more thing, my SpamAssassin won't let your blog email updates through anymore.  I had to use my other email.  Any idea what's up?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary,</p><p>Not totally sure what you are asking so forgive me if this answer is off the mark. Ray/Others forgive me if this is just plain wrong.</p><p>Flex Builder 2 or the Free SDK have the compiler that builds your .swf file from MXML and/or Actionscript 3. You then just deploy this file to a server, any server. This is just a .swf file like any other .swf file except that it will only run in Flash Player 9.</p><p>It may or may not call services on that, or other servers, that are written in CF or pretty much anything else. Ray has just set up a plain .cfm file that returns XML.</p><p>My version on my server just uses the mxml &lt;mx:http&gt; tag to call Ray's page as it did in Ray's original version. I just had to fully qualify the path.</p><p>The view source is just a nice way of showing others what is going on behind the scenes. You need to compile that code to make it "do" anything.</p><p>Server side CF code is just as per normal server side CF code. Maybe more CFC orientated though.</p><p>All that said server side things change when you get into Flex Data Services which implement data push and conflict management stuff. I have not touched FDS as of yet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's not Flex! It's not Prototype! It's not Spry!

My take on this, linked above, is meant to acknowledge the need for a quick-loading way to show a directory with lots of pix (there are 478 images in this directory), so it emphatically eschews pre-loading, etc. It uses the sort of pre-AJAX image swapping that we all used to know and love, with cfdirectory creating the population of links.</p><p>Thanks for getting this thread going, Ray! This has been a fun idea to tackle.</p></div>
