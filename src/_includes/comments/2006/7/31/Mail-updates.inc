		<div class="comment_text"><p>Perhaps a hybrid? I personally have no problems re-signing up, but I also read blogs and know that I have to do so. There are many CFCDev subscribers who don't read blogs and so they won't have any idea they have to re-sign up. Is it possible to allow re-signing up, but also pursuing a solution where you import the old subscriber list, and hopefully avoid duplicates? Just a thought...</p></div>
