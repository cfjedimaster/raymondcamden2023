		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>From comments rattling around other MXNA blogs, your preso seems to have done a great job of showing people the ease and power of Spry!</p><p>What is your guess about when we'll get some date formatting (and maybe a bit of other formatting, or even some way to do string functions) for Spry? Or are you writing the patch even as I type ;)?</p><p>-James</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As I mentioned in the preso, date formatting is hard in JS. Probably hard enough to actually change your source data to do it.</p><p>But the _first_ thing we really need is formatting support in general. I'd like to see this:</p><p>{token:func}</p><p>Or something like that. It means, pass token to func and the result is displayed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Meanwhile, I would add that taking care of the date formatting back in the source XML creation is a _very_ small price to pay for all the convenience of taking in the Spry dataset.... still, I agree that your {token:func} suggestion would be a great addition to Spry.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, can you cite the specific place where you have an example of pagination through Spry?</p><p>I am particularly interested in this in regard to large datasets... the example on the Adobe Spry examples page -</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flabs.adobe.com%2Ftechnologies%2Fspry%2Fsamples%2FPagingSample.html%3Amvo1iS2vwRAThwLC4TwJFWNwILg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/samples/PagingSample.html">http://labs.adobe.com/techn...</a></p><p>- uses pagination in the display, but loads the entire dataset before paging the actual data displayed. This still works for a dataset of 50 states, but might not do so well for a dataset of, say, 10,000 records!</p><p>Thanks!</p></div>

That's my fault.</p><p>And yea James, it WILL load the entire data set. If you think about it, there isn't much Spry can do about that.</p><p>However - you could pass to the back end a "page" number. So Spry would say, load resouce Y, page 1, and your back end would send rows 1-50. When you need the next section, Spry could just ask for it again.</p><p>This is definitely not "easy" but doable.</p><p>If folks think it worthwhile, I could try to make an example of this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, since you offered, we'd love to see a demo of your thoughts on how to do this! ;)</p><p>Actually, that's what I was wondering about, a way to call the dataset by paging in some way. Perhaps you might have one dataset that consists only of the total record count of the database, and a way to pass in a parameter to the "main" dataset fetching script that tells it the starting row and the number of rows to fetch... a sort of Spry/AJAX version of the classic next N of N logic. Are these the lines along which you were thinking?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>James, I would think that would be how you could paginate with Spry. You could obviously speed it up by caching the results on the back end and just fetch the starting row + number of records.</p></div>
