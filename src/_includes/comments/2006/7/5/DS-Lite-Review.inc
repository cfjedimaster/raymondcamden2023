		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having low sound volume is good...every time someone has the volume on their PSP or GBA cranked up in public, I want to rip the thing out of their hands and stomp on it ;)  It's right up there with people who shout into cell phones in restaurants on my list of pet peeves.</p><p>I'm actually considering picking one up because of the new Mario game too though :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well obviously in public I believe in being respectful. ;) And yeah, the new Mario kicks butt. I didn't pick it up as my brother-in-law owns it, but I'd definitely recommend it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Funny. I had the opposite. I got the PSP because my kid stole my DS. Having used both, I think the PSP is a better piece of pure hardware but the DS has far better games and selection. So, in the end I think the DS wins from a gaming perspective. Now I have seen some interesting stuff they have planned outside of pure gaming for the PSP but I won't hold my breath waiting for it to materialize.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You HAVE to try the multiplayer mode in New Super Mario Bro. Even if it means buying your wife/kid a DS :)</p><p>Best part is it's wireless single cart play.</p><p>You can also pick up some of the earlier DS games for cheap now. Project Rub makes for a bit of cheeky fun. Shame it's not multiplayer, but you can pass a DS around.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I considered buying the original DS when it first came out but it just felt too bulky and like Nintendo rushed it out because of the PSP.</p><p>When they released the properly-designed DS Lite and especially the new Mario game (plus the fact that I had a little spare cash) I no longer had any excuse not to buy one :)  Mario is excellent, Mario Kart is great and Bomberman is fantastic multiplayer fun.  The single-card wireless play is an awsome feature.</p><p>Now I'm just waiting for the first DS-specific Zelda game!  I'm a big fan of the Zelda games (spent a solid month doing very little else when Windwaker came out for the GameCube!) so I'm thinking of picking up the GBA version of either The Minish Cap or A Link to the Past to tide me over!</p></div>
