		<div class="comment_text"><p>I felt much the same way.  I enjoyed the wealth of homages to not just the Richard Donner/Chris Reeve movies, but to so many other portrayals of Superman... both film and print.</p><p>The very subtle reference to another SuperFriend made me giggle too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Superman Returns put a bad light on the characer as a love 'em and leave 'em dead-beat dad.  Used to be the character stood for "Truth, Justice, and the American Way"...now we have "Truth, Justice, and Child Support".</p><p>Can't see how Warner Bros. &amp; DC Comics allowed that "love child" plot be included in the movie.</p><p>Totally unnecessary. btw, Lois needed an older character, not some early 20 year old, mis-cast actress.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry but I have to disagree - as a long time Superman fan, I was hugely dissapointed - in fact I almost fell asleep - it seems that these days CGI and amazing visuals is regarded as some substitute for a good story. Went home and watched Superman 2 which despite its age I still think is a better film. The makeup seemed way too much with a lot of close ups looking like they had airbrushed his face. There was also a lot of shots which didn't have to be computer generated. When I first heard they were making a Superman film I expected scenes much more like the fight scenes in the second matrix. I guess the real problem with Superman is that unless he looses his powers, is exposed to Kryptonite or meets a super villan of equal power (which has basically been the theme for all the films) - there is never really a feeling that he is in real danger after all he is invincible!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Kola, wouldn't your last complaint (abut Supes only being in danger rarely) also apply just as much tot he old movies, and the comics? It seems like despite this "flaw", people still like the story. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok. First off I thought the film was great... Was very excited whe I heard it was coming out. But....</p><p>The only real problem I have is the child... Not that he had a child mind you, but HOW?.. Lets look:<br>Movie one: no hanky panky.. saves Lois by spining the earth backwards..<br>Movie two: ZOD, Gives up powers.. He and Lois have a go, wipes her memory at the end.<br>Movie three: Richard Pryor.. No love there.<br>Movie four: Doesn't he start going after Lana Lang again.. No Lois Love in that film.</p><p>Now the back story for "Returns" says he was gone for five years.. That "love child" is five years old.. If we put them in a time line and assume that film two was the only "action" superman and Lois saw with each other...... Then HOW?</p></div>
