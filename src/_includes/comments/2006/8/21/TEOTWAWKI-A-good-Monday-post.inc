		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, remember that in the past, there have been quite a few times where over 99% of living things on earth went extinct, and each time it came back :) It will just take a really long time. I recommend the book "Rare Earth" if you want an interesting read in how "rare" our Earth is and how we should come to appreciate the life on it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In Earth, a short history of everything, the author mentions 5 major extinctions and multiple smaller ones. The worst one was the Permian-Triassic which killed 95%. Not quite 99, but too close. ;)</p></div>

He analyses why entire cultures became extinct - not through nuking themselves for the most part. Maybe we could be the first?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think there are many people who would be willing to initiate TEOTWAWKI if all they had to do was unplug something, much like Snake did in the movie Escape from LA.  I would.  Would you?  I just put a TEOTWAWKI button on my web site.  I wonder how many would be willing to punch the button.</p></div>
