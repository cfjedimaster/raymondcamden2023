		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, i'd be happy if they'd just ban cock blocking...  I 100% agree with you that there should be personal accountability for waste generated in government. Business too for that matter. You should check out the movie "The Corporation" if you haven't seen it. I think you would dig it.</p><p>sean</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Being a father of four children, two of them boys, I really don't need the government to tell me to be a responsible parent.  The fact they are wasting money on this instead of alternative fuels, replacing city/state cars with hybrids, the two wars we are fighting, reducing taxes, etc etc etc, is just insanity.</p></div>
