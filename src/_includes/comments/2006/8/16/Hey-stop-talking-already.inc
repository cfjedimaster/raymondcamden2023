		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't believe it... the timing is uncanny...</p><p>I just decided to release my very first public release of a CFC.  I was all proud about it and excited to finaly contribute something to the public domain.  And then I come over here to your blog to see how you go about releasing things and I see the top post is for GoogleCal that does very much the same thing on exactly the same day.  I'm stunned...</p><p>Ray, as always, you are the man.  If I had to get beaten to it, I'm glad it was by you.  I'm going to spend tomorrow checking out your GoogleCal and learning how to improve mine.</p><p>If anyone wants to check it out: <br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfradiance.blogspot.com%2F2006%2F08%2Fcfc-google-calendar-feed-parser-for.html%3AikvUp-C0cR3WI_WahGz2enUd0ts&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cfradiance.blogspot.com/2006/08/cfc-google-calendar-feed-parser-for.html">http://cfradiance.blogspot....</a></p><p>Too funny...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm thrilled. I'm sick and tired of hearing folks say there isn't enough CF open source out there. I like that you let folks filter the dates returned, mine just returns the dates, all of them period. Do you mind if I add that feature to mine?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No, please, use whatever you like from mine.  That's the purpose of it anyways, to get it out there and see how it can be improved by others.  I'm learning quite a few things from your take on it.  You also completed yours in less than half the code it took me!  Interesting... gonna have to look into optimizing and losing some of the gold plating!</p><p>Yea, I hear ya about the open source thing.  But your site has always been a great resource to me and is one of the inspirations for me to create a blog to put my own contributions out there.  Thanks a lot Ray and keep up the good work!</p></div>
