		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice! I actually had a similar idea since it is very difficult to find games suitable for younger kids. My kid is only about to turn 4 but he has been into games for some time already - especially Mario and Sonic on his GameCube and DS. I'd be happy to contribute if you are ever looking for contributors. P.S. Some type of age minimum or range would be useful in my opinion - but overall this is looks great.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did see that. I meant specific to the each game within the review. Preteen and younger is still a wide range.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, we would consider Flash games. As for reviews from other parents, not right now. But - we are considering adding Forums soon. This would let parents right their own reviews and comment on ours.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great idea.<br>I'm not a gamer, having two kids (2 and 10 months) and dealing with work doesn't leave too much time. Which brings up the question exactly how many clones do you and Ben have?</p><p>I'll bookmark the website because I'm interested in the flash games, right now the older one is playing some Flash games from Sesame Street and Nick Jr. but his getting tired of them, at some point we'll have to go and explore other options. When that happens I'll definitely pay the website a visit.</p><p>Regards, <br>Fernando</p></div>
