		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh my,  I wonder how much brain power and resources will be devoted to this debate.  If the same resources and brain trust would focus on things that matter - AIDS, poverty, peace, alternate energy sources... you know trivial stuff like that, one wonders what could be accomplished. Then there's the cost of rewriting all the science books.   But I digress   :-)</p><p>Lawrence</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I work at the Allen F. Blocher Planetarium.  Despite the fact that we will have to revise many of our shows, I am in favor of demoting Pluto.</p><p>All those causing trouble are being difficult are what we call kermugins.  Some one that doesn’t like change.  It is what they learned in school so that is what they want to keep it.  Pluto has always been an oddball and never fit into the planetary realm.  I am sure we haven’t herd the end of this, but my stance has always been Pluto isn’t a planet.</p></div>
