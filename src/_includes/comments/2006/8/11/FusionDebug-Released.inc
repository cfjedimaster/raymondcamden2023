		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, seems a bit steep to me too, but then again I wouldn't be looking at it from the perspective of a large development team.  I think a lot of people are drawn to the Eclipse platform for it's open nature and low cost.  I got to work with the beta and it was okay, but I've never really used a debugging tool like this as part of my development process and with this price tag it won't entice me to want to rush out and start using one.  If it had a price tag around $79-$99 for a single developer license then it would definitely be tempting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I too think the price is fine. You can't discount the value of good development tools, and with CFE already being free, I think this price is fine.</p></div>
