		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, now I have to learn it!  That was the missing piece for me - loved the data portion, but without the effects I couldn't sell it...everyone was too wowed by the scriptaculous and rico effects.  This takes care of that problem!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How's the file size on the javascript? I've been using a library called jQuery for a few months now and it's awesome. It's got an active community, lots of plugins and best of all, the entire codebase (including ajax, effects, dom manipulation and more) is only 10k.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Right now the 2 ones you need just for data work are a bit big. 70k for the Google XPath lib and 91 for the main data lib, but as this is still in beta I think it is fair to expect optimization to come later.</p></div>
