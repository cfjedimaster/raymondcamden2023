		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ray,</p><p>Tell her to ask the local MUG and / or CFUG in her area to send out am email with her resume requesting a position. The CFUG down here often has job postings and a lot of the people on the CFUG mailing list are headhunters (sorry for the term). Also she should be sending her resume to every headhunter in her area. Remember that headhunters look through the resumes that they have in their own database first before posting it to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FMonster.com%3AX1KPyh_5IdWVJARR3Wl1NFiofv0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Monster.com">Monster.com</a> so they don't have to spend the money or split commisions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's my rent for the day. And I'm not trying to have a go at your friend Ray, but just at the trend in general. Why is it that screens are getting bigger, resolutions higher, the internet faster, yet websites keep shrinking.<br>Seriously, in the past few years, blogs have kept shrinking in width, and I think her website is a perfect example of that trend going a bit too far.</p><p>Now, before you all just lose it on me, keep in mind it really isn't a personal attack of any kind, but more an expression of how fashion (may it be clothes or pixels :-)) can frustrate me.</p><p>&lt;cf_shield /&gt;<br>tof</p></div>
