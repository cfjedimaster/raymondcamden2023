		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea Ray. He's sick. Sick of hearing complaints.   haha. Just kidding. I have an idea for you.</p><p>Your state has a pretty new 'lemon law' and you should backdoor it. Research the law and find which congressman submitted it and which supported it. Then try to find out why it was born. Contact the interested parties and I think you will find some very powerful people to help you out.</p><p>If your congressman was serious about this law, he (his office) will help you and get your problem solved. Let the 'force' do the work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I dunno about the size of your readership, but I do know that I tell everyone I know about your problem - if for no other reason than to take great pleasure in someone ELSE's misery ;)</p><p>My brother is a doctor, and was looking to buy a car just to tool around in.  He seriously looked at a Mini, and said that they were fun to drive, but ended up buying a Saab instead.  I would like to *think* that your story pushed him in the right direction.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I suspect it's much like anything else, but I have an ex that had (or maybe still has) a mini (the "S" series) and she loved it.  Never had any trouble with it.  I sure as hell enjoyed driving it.</p><p>Like I said, it's probably like anything else...experiences vary.  :-)</p></div>
