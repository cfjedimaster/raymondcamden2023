		<div class="comment_text"><p>As with John I run my own consulting company.  Unlike John, I can't justify the expense of going.  For me it isn't worth it.</p><p> It just comes down to how I learn things, which isn't in a classroom type of setting.  That diminishes the benefit of such a conference.</p><p> I'll be watching the news as it gets posted in the blogsphere and am gonna be jealous about all the fun, though.  I'm fine w/ not being cool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Aww, you make me sad, Ray. I've gone to DevCon/MAX every year since 2001, but when budget request time came this year, MAX was not yet announced, so I went to CFUnited. It was great, but I only get one major conference a year (unless Simon will give me a MAX admission...) ;-) so I shall be one of the uncool kids looking on in envy...</p></div>
