		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cutter, she couldn't be Boomer, right?  Boomer was resurrected back on Caprica, and is working with Number 6 to convince the Cylons to stop killing humans. The Sharon that was put in charge of the rescue op is the one that Helo met on Caprica, and who has been in captivity on the Galactica....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually Edward has it right (and I should have remembered that after she introduced herself that way to Cali(sp?) in that episode). But Ray has it like I see it. I'm talking about the Sharon that had the baby with Helo, who came off the Raptor with a load of Marines. Where are the Marines? The resistence is being duped by another Sharon. Or, that's how it looks to me right now. We'll find out next week!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Sharon that had the baby has been a 'prisoner' on Galactica sinced before she gave birth.  I am convinved that the Sharon that Adamamsent down to New Caprica is the same one who gave birth.</p><p>As for the ambush, my guess is it was Tigh(sp)'s wife whi tipped them off.</p><p>One thing that ticked me off is that the previews seemed to give too much away.  At one point you see Roslyn(sp) in what used to be her office.  Kind of ruins the 'cliff hanger' we were left with at the end of the season premiere.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea Ray, the Sharon that came off the Raptor was with a group of Marines. But the Sharon that met up with the resistence, not long before the bucket heads opened fire on the group, was alone. That's why I'm thinking it's not Helo's Sharon, but part of a setup stemming off of the plans Tigh's wife stole (when she was supposed to be burning them).</p></div>
