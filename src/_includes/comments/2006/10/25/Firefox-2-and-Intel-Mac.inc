		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am almost certain the problem lies with the Google Toolbar. I do run the Web Developer toolbar, but I don't show the toolbar, I just use the context menu. I had lots of crashing with my usual set of extensions, but over time I've been experimenting with different sets. No Google Toolbar, no crashing. Could be just a problem with the new FF and extensions that add toolbars. Hope that helps someone.</p></div>

I have the latest <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%3ATFCVT1TLM3gIVvhu7UvDqoNlAOY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> add-on.</p><p>Oh yeah, almost forgot:  This all started the day I realized that I am a squirrel.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm using a MacBook with Firefox, and it crashes constantly. I get the endless beachball, but what's more irritating is that I can't even force quit the application - I have to shut down my computer. In fact, I had endless problems with previous versions of FF and switched back to Safari until I found that more and more websites were giving me an 'unsupported browser warning' with it.</p><p>I gather it might help to uninstall the FF add-ons - can someone tell me how you do this?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I posted on this more recently. I found that the major cause of trouble with FF was Firebug. I had it turned on for all sites. Turning it off - and then turning it when I needed to - helped a LOT.</p></div>
