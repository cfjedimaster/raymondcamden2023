		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cheap.</p><p>One the biggest hurdles IMO for CF programmers is cheap hosting.  I'd love to use and tinker with Ray's blog apps, etc but just can't afford CF hosting...  CF hosting is not inexpensive, esp. compared to Linux hosting where I can install Wordpress for $8 month (or less).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agree with Jim. Cheap hosting is great for everyone but it's hard to keep costs low because CF is pretty darn expensive. So, I'm still stuck with PHP/Rails hosting since it's pretty cheap.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally, I don't agree with the cheap hosting need. But I suppose it depends on cheap. To me - and I said this in an article going live soon - I wouldn't trust a host whose price is less than that of a meal at Burger King. You get what you pay for. An 8 dollar host would not strike me as something I'd want to put a paying client on. I've seen plenty of CF hosts in the 20-50 dollar range, which is still cheap (and still close to the cost of a family meal at BK).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I should have clarified my 'cheap' comment.</p><p>I'd like to see a host that provided cheap entry-level hosting for developers who just need a place to host a blog, wiki or discussion forum and ideally a place to host code they are developing that will change the world :)</p><p>If you have paying clients, or are selling a CF product or service, etc - I have no problems with paying for business class services.</p><p>I certainly wouldn't expect the same level of services but then again for a home blog and some family email - it shouldn't be needed.</p><p>I pay $8/mo and don't expect 24x7 performance - but it does leave me a few bucks in my pocket for Happy Meals :)</p><p>Jim</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The number 1 thing a host should have is tech support that knows CF. Many great hosts went down hill very fast, like Intermedia, when they scaled down on their inhouse CF knowledge.
