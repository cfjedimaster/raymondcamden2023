		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually asked the question at the "Meet the CF Team" session and the answer was a pretty emphatic "NO".  They (the CF TEam) do not think that there is any benefit to adding improved functionality to CF Forms with Flex 2 available.  Their argument has always been that what we have been able to do with Flash Forms was never intended and had Flex 2 been available at the CF 7 was released, Flash Forms may have never come to pass.  I was a little disappointed, but then I went to Ben Forta's session on CF and Flex, and I will be the first to say that they have a point.  Flex and CF are a very powerful combination.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agreed and all good points - my biggest concern is Adobe pulling them (FF) from the product since I have some production sites that would be in big trouble.  I'm still fairly new to all of this (2 yrs) - is that a valid concern, or no?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've RARELY seen Allaire/MACR/Adobe remove a function. I can think of only one example - the advanced security functions. I think it is safe to assume FF will be in CF for years to come.</p></div>
