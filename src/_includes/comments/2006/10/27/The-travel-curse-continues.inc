		<div class="comment_text"><p>My trip back from MAX isn't going smoothly either.  My red-eye flight left late, so I and another guy (another MAXer, didn't catch his name) had to sprint down the hallways of O'Hare to make our connecting flight to Baltimore.</p><p>The plane was still there when we arrived, but they had already closed the gate.  We were about to get booked on later flights by other ticket agents when they received word that the plane was delayed due to mechanical problems, so they got us on board the plane.</p><p>We sat there with the other passengers while they tried to fix the problem--they even rebooted the plane!--but no luck.  They didn't have the part to fix the problem, so they cancelled the flight.</p><p>So now I'm on standby for a noon flight, and if I don't get that one, I'll be on the 7pm flight (the other MAXer got on a flight to Washington DC instead).</p><p>I've never had problems with flying before (not like this) anyway.  Perhaps I caught the curse from being at Ray's sessions.  :)</p></div>
