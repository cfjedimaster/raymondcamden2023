		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, Ray, it's not prompting for username/password, but it does just kind of hang (says "connecting"), never opening the window to show the video itself.</p><p>BTW, once you do confirm it's running, I hope you'll add it to the UGTV listing (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcarehart.org%2Fugtv%29%3AeubAwFq8Ze7AOGTChrrSXyjCJEo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="carehart.org/ugtv)">carehart.org/ugtv)</a>. It's really simple: just your name, email (not shared), the title and url. Anyone can add recordings there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Seems to me they've hosed this whole thing up now since it was called Breeze. I've tried to login using two different logins (work &amp; personal). Both have failed. I've asked for my password to be sent to me. Twice for each. No emails yet after two days. I guess I'm not going to be watching this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Steve, really, I wouldn't blame any snafu on the change from Breeze to Adobe Connect. For now, it's mostly just a name change I think. The new products under those names aren't due till November.</p><p>As for the challenges here, there are 2: if in the past you were being prompted for a login/password, that was a mistake because Ray had not set the meeting to be open. He's since changed that. I don't know if he or someone else will be getting the submissions you're making to login, but since it's now a moot point, I'd recommend you let that part go.</p><p>The remaining challenge, however, as I said in my previous comment, is that the recorded presentation never shows. It just hangs at "connecting", which I've never seen before. (And it could just be a problem on my end. If anyone has now succeeded in connecting, please do say so. Or if one more person can confirm they are seeing it stop at "connecting", that will give Ray some feedback to go on. No need for several people to report if it fails for them, I'd think.</p><p>Indeed, Steve, you may want to be the first test case. If you visit the URL now, are you still prompted to to login? You really should not be.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Guys - there is no need to keep checking. I promise to post here as soon as I know. Unfortunately, it still seems like the answer will be no. It is my fault because I didn't hit stop on the record button when I left. (Can I blame the cold? I was sick.)</p><p>But again - Adobe is checking.</p></div>
