		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok.. When Kate was breaking the rocks, there was a point where a woman hiding in the bushes got her attention and asked her if there was another man in the cages with her and Jack..</p><p>When Kate said "no" she seemed upset and asked where "Carl" had gone... she said something about them not supposed to be using those cages? (I may be dreaming that last part?)</p><p>Then she asked Kate where she got the dress and said it was hers but Kate could keep it...</p><p>She was definately hiding from the "others"..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Carl was the boy with Sawyer in the cages last week.  Remember Juliet (aka Blonde woman who would kill Kate) caught him after his and Sawyer's escape.  Carl was gone with Kate was brought back to the cages so she was not lying to Alex when she stated that she had not seen Carl.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To your first point - they have communication with the outside world - so obviously they did some research. Remember they had plants in the camps?</p><p>As for your second point - I don't agree. I thought he looked upset. Also - did you notice how the blond chick said, "All they would do is go aroundin circles". I don't think they were worried per se. Walt had to use _one_ exact heading to escape, so I'm thinking the space/time is warped around the island.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am getting pretty interested in Julietâ€™s story arc. What is her deal? One minute she shows some empathy and tosses Sawyer the water, and the next she holds a gun to Kate. (Or was she just testing Sawyer?)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I enjoyed the episode, but then I seem to enjoy every episode.  The only thing that I would say is that it was risky to have the joke about the Red Sox which will fall flat and have no meaning what so ever everywhere else in the world because only a rabid international sports fan would know about what a big deal it was for them to win that year and why Jack would not believe that they had won.</p><p>I also am intrigued by Juliette, can't figure her out - she's both tough and gentle.  I'm interested to see what happens with her character.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What did everyone else think when Ben mentioned the date, do you believe he is telling the truth??? I still can't think if this is somehow set in the future and that was nothing but a ruse? It sounds far fetched but then I think of the "monster" and think anything is still possible.</p><p>Also why is Ben interested in the boat?? They had a boat (micheal left on it last season), surely if they have contact to the outside world someone could sail in?</p><p>Damn these questions! :o)</p></div>
