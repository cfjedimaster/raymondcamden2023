		<div class="comment_text"><p>You missed out on the Acrobat 3D presentation.  They had a 3D object of a cell phone with a flash interface over the buttons allowing the presenter to "dial" a number that played a video clip from Close Encounters.  It was pretty awesome.  They also won the best preso award.</p></div>
