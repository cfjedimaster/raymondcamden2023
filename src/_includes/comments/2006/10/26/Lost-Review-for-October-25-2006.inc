		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought from when they first showed it that what Desmond built was a lighting rod.  I never thought that maybe it caused the storm.</p><p>As soon as Ben told Sawyer that they put a pacemaker in that he was lying.  Contrary to what LOST and Pulp Fiction show, a) you would never need to put a needle 'through the sternum', b) any needle strong enough to actually go through the sternum would be about as thick as a pencil, c) there are really only 2 times you need to put a needle in someone's chest like that and that is for a cardiac tamponade or a tension pnuemothorax (the latter typically done near the clavicle).  I hate that TV and movies do anything medical to make it dramatic. End of rant.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that whole scene with Desmond and Claire was another glimpse into his ability to 'see the future' that we saw last week with Lockes speech.</p><p>He knew the lightning was goig to hit so he asked her to move down the beach and the roof was a scapegoat. Thats why he persisted and built the lighting rod 'experiment'.</p><p>Something I noticed last week about Lockes vision during his visit to the sweat lodge has me thinking. When Boone was pushing him through the airport in the wheelchair, you can see Ben (leader of the others) doing security scans on some of the passengers using a hand-held metal detector. What gives? Any thoughts on this?</p><p>This season has definately been one of my favorites so far! After all this time we finally get to see what the 'others' are up to!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree that Desmond had fore knowledge that the lightning was going to strike where Claire and the baby were located.  This is why he built the lightning rod to redirect the lightning.</p><p>I don't buy the separate Island bit.  It is just a projection.  Of course in real life it is there, since they do film on Hawaii.  The Windward view mountains of Oahu are often prevalent in various scenes.  So is some of the same valleys used in Jurassic Park.</p><p>I say it is the same Island because of the Dock in last weeks where the one lady was shot was on this Island and it is where Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were captured.  They others didn't take a boat to try and capture Jin and the other survivors.  Although it was night when she was shot and it was at least morning when they brought her back.  This could be explained however due to the fact that the dock as a good hike from where they were at.  Also, if the polar bears escaped from the cages that Sawyer and Kate are in, how did they get to the other island?</p></div>

After all, he was found running around the forest naked, and said something along the lines that 'they' stripped him and left him there...) The lightning rod 'experiment' was to draw the lightning away from Clare and the baby. He had to call it an experiment to Hurley, as he couldn't explain how he knew what was going to happen.</p><p>What I want to know is how the Losties have never seen the second island before? In season 1, Sayeed went on a walkabout around the island, and made it at least halfway round. They have also sailed part way round, and the tailies lived on the opposite side of the island. In all of that time, how could they not see another island on the horizon? It can't be an image/project/mirage.... thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My theory?  Desmond can't see the future -- but he can see the past.  See, all of this has happened before.  Nobody knows, though -- except for Desmond (and perhaps the Others).  It's kinda like Doc Brown in Back to the Future, harnessing the lightning to send Marty back.  That's why Desmond knew Locke would make his little speech, because he did it before and Desmond was there seeing it.  Of course, Locke, like every other Lostie, has forgotten.  Don't forget that the island is a huge experiment, and experiments are only worth their salt if their results can be consistently reproduced.</p><p>Seems to make more sense to me than Desmond's sudden ability to predict the future -- but hey, it's just my opinion!</p><p>- Sung</p></div>
