		<div class="comment_text"><p>Andrew- you should definitely check out the form validation demo, regardless.  Clientside functionality, yes - but some very slick utilities you'll probably find interesting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>nat: I had not really paid attention to the transitions - I was mainly looking at layout plus the form controls. I don't know - for me - on multiple machines - it runs great.</p><p>Andrew: I know that the Spry team is working on this as well. On one hand though I feel like they are -far- beyond others when it comes to that _already_. Yes, there are things I'd like to see added (like parsing WDDX), but I've yet to see an AJAX framework that does data quite as easily.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Effects are the modern medicine man of web development. If someone is doing a gallery they may be important. There aren't many business application reasons for effects though. Basically that belongs in Flash or something else where it works better. I want to see them concentrating on features that make applications work better. (Capturing changes so we can send them back to the server, JSON, etc.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be anal John - I don't think this release had any effects. It did had UI controls. I think we need to differentiate betwen the two. I as well don't care about effects/transitions. I do care about UI controls as I think they help (or can help) a user navigate a complex process.</p><p>My 2 cents.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was responding to Nat's comment Ray. And you might want to change your disposition or the "Cool Guys" you said were going to be at MAX won't let you sit at thier table! LOL</p><p>My point was that people are getting side tracked with effects. (Including the wonderful designers of the technology.) It would be good if they saved the effects for things like galleries, and let the rest shine without blemish!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan, you can't yet. It was just shown in a demo. Now - you CAN view source and download. That's what I did for cfspry (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfspry.riaforge.org%3AGEAVlWDmXn5g-LHloKjeZin0WsQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cfspry.riaforge.org">http://cfspry.riaforge.org</a>), but it isn't recommended probably. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks - it has been working wonderfully for what I need!  I was starting to do some minor modifications but I thought I would ask here first to see if someone may have already done it.</p><p>On my page I have 3 tabs and from any tab they can click search (the search is below the spry tabs so you see the same search button all the time). When the page returns with the results I would like to have tb 3 back in focus.  Now I know that use selected = 3 but before I modify the onclick for the tabs to set a variable so I know which tab they last viewed I wanted to check to see if I am missing an easier way of capturing the tab in focus when they click submit?  Thanks</p></div>
