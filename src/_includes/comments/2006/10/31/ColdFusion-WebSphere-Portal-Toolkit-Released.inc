We currently have a coldfusion based intranet.</p><p>I am trying to make the case for staying with CF for future application development.  The push is to move to either or both Portlet Factory or Rational development tools.</p><p>How can I sell staying with CF and not going to a new tool that will likely have a steep learning curve especially Rational Java / JSP toolset.</p><p>Also, what does this toolset actually do for me as a CF developer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you hit it on the head when you mentioned the steep learning curve. CF's barrier to entry is much lower than other technologies. I think this portlet toolkit will let you have the best of both worlds. Enabling you to continue to use CF where appropriate.</p><p>Does that make any sense?</p></div>
