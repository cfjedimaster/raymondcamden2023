		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was glad to get explanations (sortof) for the polar bears and sharks.  The guy who locked Sawyer up said "it only took the bear two hours" to figure out the food thing.  So maybe the bears escaped and ended up at the camp in Season 1.  Then the lady holding Jack hostage replied "and dolphins too" when Jack asked if his giant aquarium cell used to hold sharks.  That might explain the sharks at the beginning of Season 2 with the Dharma logo on them.</p><p>Wow, what a fun start to the season!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There were some things about Juliet's actions with Jack too that seemed to me that she'd been through all this before and was tired of it. And she doesn't quite seem to fit in with the others - preferring Steven King to more literary works, burning the muffins, getting left behind by Henry er Ben when the water floods the room - that sort of thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you're forgetting some big details!.. the earthquake was the result of Desmond not entering the numbers in time..remember? That created the force that pulled the plane down. So not really an earthquake. So the island doesn't draw things in (by itself that is). And what about the allusion to to everything being 'all about Jack'?  I thougt that was a pretty big detail.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Did anyone else catch the odd hand gesture, complete with a "beat" or two in the action, that the woman (forget the name) made when talking to Jack.....almost as if she was saying one thing, but meant him to hear something else.  Jack reacts to it.  Not sure what it meant, if anything.</p></div>
