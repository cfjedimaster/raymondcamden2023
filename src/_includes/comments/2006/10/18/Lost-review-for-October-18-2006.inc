		<div class="comment_text"><p>No, the reason desmond knew about Lockes speech was because he had seen it before.  All of the characters in lockes vision other than the passengers were working in the airport, ie Ben is a baggage scanner, desmond the pilot, Hurley the ticket guy etc, it seems that the airport staff experience the whole scenario over and over...even Hurley realises this when locke does the speech...and that was why Ben sent Hurley back to the camp...</p><p>Was trying to get my head around the whole parallel universe space time continum thing...anyway I know I am on to something...just got to sit back and think about it a bit more...smell the roses</p><p>And the show is not named Lost cause they are on a deserted island...its because all of the characters are lost in their life, they have unresolved issues etc....</p><p>I am mad about Jericho as well, especially with the whole North Korea/Iran nuke talk happening now....not sure how long that can last though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the Bad CGI for the bears is on purpose (the plane explosion in the first episode was OK).  I think the others are descendents of the original experimenters, and some of the experiments were on animals (the bears and the non-attacking sharks in a way earlier episode with the logos on them that used to be in the tank that Jack is in now &lt;breath /&gt;)<br>Seeing the preview of next week with Sawyer strapped to a table and them holding a BIG syringe over him coupled with the fact that Ben has always lived on the island and the fact that they are able to contact the outside world re-enforces this for me.  So, the possibility that the Bad CGI bears are actually bears mutated from experiments by the Others' ancestors is a viable one to me....and would explain why the bears look funny.  The dirty look to them is easy, they are white bears on a tropical island. Also, the cave had only human bones in it and a part of a lab coat with a dharma logo with No Animal in the center of it...if they were normal bears, they would drag more into the cave than just human food. And did anyone notice that the bear face when Locke exited the sweat lodge looked an awful lot like the little beasty in The Crate (from Stephen King series, forget the name) or is it just me.</p></div>

I'm watching Jericho but a lot of that is going to depend on how well the story writers can keep that going...</p><p>The Lost previews certainly look good though!  And Battlestar is back on as well.  Finally some good geek TV!</p><p>One weird thing I noticed - is the "deja-vu" thing at the end with Hurley - There was a commercial I saw for a show or movie called "deja-vu" - did anyone else catch that or am I dreaming?</p><p>Jim</p></div>
