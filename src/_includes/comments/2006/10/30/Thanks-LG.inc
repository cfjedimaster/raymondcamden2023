		<div class="comment_text"><p>A friend of mine owns a set of these &amp; warned me that they look good but just don't count on using them. I didn't know MS was in this market???</p><p>&lt;/MS Dig&gt;</p><p>I read your blog religiously and appreciate you sharing your knowledge!!!</p><p>Here's an experience of my own with Best Buy that you might like...</p><p>I have a Gateway laptop &amp; the motherboard got fried earlier this year. So I hope to save a little time waiting to get it back &amp; take it to Best Buy instead of shipping it to Gateway, lesson learned. I drop it off, tell them I want the motherboard replaced &amp; find out it will be a week or so.</p><p>Three weeks goes by, and they call to let me know it's finally back. When I get there the guy informs me that I have a refund coming to me. Originally paid a little over $200 so I'm confused at this point knowing what's involved to replace a motherboard. But hey, okay - maybe they really are that good.</p><p>He gives me my laptop &amp; I start looking over the paperwork which indicates that I need a new motherboard. Ummm...yeah, I already knew that. So when he comes to hand me my refund (less the fee for them to tell me it's the motherboard) I ask questions.</p><p>As he begins to explain things to me in small words so that I can understand my husband starts shaking his head and just looks at the ground. I stood there for a minute then told him I already knew it needed a motherboard, and showed him the original paperwork. Still sure of himself he stands there &amp; I said - okay, so this is a fee to tell me what I already knew???</p><p>Then went on to say this is like if my washer is not working at home &amp; I call someone to work on it. They come over, tell me yes it is definitely broken &amp; that will be $125 but don't fix it.</p><p>I walked out with a full refund &amp; my husband laughing...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray... bad laptops, bad dish washers, bad cars... you better let the wife do the shopping and stay home! LOL</p><p>IMO... when we quit doing business with local business to save money, it was only time before it came back to haunt us. I enjoy your rants... it's sorta like an offline TV comedy! (BTW... I have had simular issues. It's like you buy the warrantee so when you call they don't just hang up. Then it's like being in a third world country pleading for them to honor the contract. Pretty sad state of affairs. Hope things work out for you.)</p><p>Also, looking to replace my families' dishwasher... tip is helpful. I would avoid buying front load washers that don't have more than just a couple of shock absorbers also. Our current one has six!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow... serious bummer. :(</p><p>We recently purchased new appliances too. I shopped around a lot - at a combination of big boxes and appliance dealers. I saw the LG line at Best Buy and other big box stores and was interested. But I noticed that the appliance dealers didn't carry them - so I asked why. The sales reps at two different (reputable) stores told me that the store was planning to carry the LG line until the senior reps &amp; store managers informed the owner that they would quit. I guess they make great phones... but not great appliances.</p><p>In general my experience with Best Buy has also been poor.</p></div>
