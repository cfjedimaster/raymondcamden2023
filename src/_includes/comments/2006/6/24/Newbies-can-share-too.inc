		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Thanks for the post I found it really interesting. As you know I am a newbie, and I learn so much by reading cf blogs, and by downloading open source projects. Actually, if it was not for these sources I would have the oppertunity ot lean as much as I have. I always think that no matter how much knowledge one aquires there is always a chance to learn more, and if others have aquired knowledge that is useful to people less experience, then I think that that sort of information should be shared. What is the point of having knowledge if you're not going to share it?</p><p>I will have to say that I am greatful that the coldfusion comminuty is so open to sharing information and code. Actually, everybody I have contacted with newbie questions about there open source code as been extremely helpful in helping me understand.</p><p>Basically what I am trying to say is Thanks for sharing`-`<br>John</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I enjoyed reading your post. I am not a newbie (aren't we all a newbie somehow?) to CF and see that people I know always download code and go trough it and learn from it. I myself teached myself all the code I know trough this too. Actually right now I am getting into Flex and what I do, after reading the manual and first steps, I download code and see how others are doing it.</p><p>Speaking of reinventing the wheel, does anybody know a application to write a good online manual, expect RoboHelp and alike?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I will have to call you on that one. There is a lie in your article. You said you wouldn't trust open source code written by God! (Now going with the presumption that there is a "God" that was writting code for you to use. Let's be straight... based on that assumption none of us would be qualified to review the code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm glad you liked the editorial, Ray. For the record, I did state in that same article that "As the community grows and the number of open source projects continues to increase...[projects will be] developed and managed in such a way that it is relatively easy for any somewhat decent developer to contribute". My statements about newbies were more of a warning about the possible release of software developed poorly but without a warning to those who might use it in their apps or worse - learn from the code. Actually, the article was more about making suggestions, and it wasn't so much a warning, as a declaration that your suggestion that a newbie can contribute to open source code makes me nervous (my exact words in the article, in fact).</p><p>Anyway, like I said, I'm glad you liked the article... see you at CFUnited in a couple days. I'm sure we wouldn't have a difficult time putting together an impromptu round table with other attendees in the hotel bar ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Geeze, I go away for a few hours and things get a bit testy. :)</p><p>Nitai - why not use RoboHelp? It seems prety nice.</p><p>John - It was a joke. It should be obvious I would think. My personal feeling is that God would not be offended by such statements, but - let's leave religion out of it. I won't mention God again in this entry, and folks, let's just let this thread die. No need to keep it going. No offense was meant - and none should be taken.</p><p>Gary - Heh. I hope you are joking. I've already adopted three times. That's enough... for now.</p><p>Sean - good point. You know - I think it would be helpful if I were to write a few entries on how I examine code. The contest series showed the results of my examinations, but not the logic behind it. And you are exactly right - even ten years in - I still write code that - every now and then - makes me shudder later on.</p><p>Simon - I still say that there is nothing wrong with a newbie releasing code. It could be just fine. It is the responsibility of the user to check the code first. I had a problem, and a newbie provided the solution, that would be fine with me. If the code works - performs well - and is secure - I don't care if his dog wrote it. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>As always, thanks for the great contributions you make to our community everyday. Your words, code, and experience, help developers around the globe learn this exciting and dynamic technology.</p><p>I've been developing in CF since 4.0, and I can't even count how many times I've rewritten example code (or even 'enterprise' applications) that I've had to touch. I've seen Fusebox apps that would make anyone cringe, and spaghetti code out the ying-yang. But all of it helped me learn in one way or another, either in how to do something, what to do, or what not to do. I think another important thing to note is that, though someone may be a CF newbie that doesn't mean that they don't know something about programming, design, or development in general. A CF newbie might know little about CF, but you may pick up some interesting javascript, css, or better ways of doing things with xml or xhtml. You can always learn something from other peoples code, bad or good.</p><p>By the way, I've never seen anything written in CF by Simon Horwith? Why is that?</p><p>Look for me at CFUnited. I'll probably be somewhere with Aaron West (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trajiklyhip.com%3AAba55agrlvX5mq01t0qIzVAr8Ws&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.trajiklyhip.com">http://www.trajiklyhip.com</a>).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cutter,<br>  You must not be looking very hard. I frequently post downloadable code on my blog - there's a "downloads" category associated with all of the posts that include downloadable code. I also make code from presentations available frequently, did have code on another domain but I decided to let that one lapse, contributed to several of the Macromedia DRKs (I wrote the various CFML APIs on different CDs), and you can download my petmarket sample from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfpetmarket.com%3AVpOdRK5P9I3nNQfCv1FTXWwRZsc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.cfpetmarket.com">www.cfpetmarket.com</a>. Is there something in particular you'd like me to code?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cutter, let's please not get personal. I certainly don't think Simon's editorial was personal. He and I go back quite a ways, so I read it as it was - a disagreement. Simon is certainly free to be wrong. (Ok, that last line was a joke in case folks don't know. As I said, Simon knows me. ;)</p></div>

It really wasn't meant as a personal attack, and I'll admit that I've never looked at your blog (I think it may be your view on frameworks that keeps me away, but I'm a convert).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good code, bad code.  Gurus can make mistakes.  Newbie can have unbeleiveable insights that make people think.</p><p>Code can be bad for one solution, but perfect for another.  Don't get me wrong, some code is just bad for everything.</p><p>I believe we all have been there or will be there.  We look back on old code and shudder at the thought.  I personally get this monumentus urge to rewrite it as soon as I see it.  I know that desn't permit, so I move on.</p><p>As for rewriting the wheel, I enjoy this actually.  How can you truly appreciate a custom piece of code until you have tried to solve the same solution yourself?</p><p>I wrote Ray an email one day about writing my own blog.  I know that their is free blogs everywhere and Ray's blogCFC is damn good.  I could even use Doug Hughes's Reactor blog using MG 1.1.x and transform it in MG Unity.</p><p>What would I gain from using pre-written code?  I would save time from development and debugging.  What would I gain from not using pre-written code?  Understanding of good practices.  If I run into a problem with a piece of code, I examine the fruits and labors of others for ideas.  Open source projects are like libraries to read how people approach problem solving and design patterns.  Would I use pre-written code for a client? Absolutely!  I would not want to waste billable time re-writing the wheel for small to medium clients.</p><p>There is a lot of talk of round table discussions at CF United.  Name a time and place and where the beer flows.  I will be there Tuesday evening.  Simon, Ray, Sean, all..put your beer where your mouth is and let's all be happy. =)</p><p>Cheers!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>1. One side effect of freedom of speech is having a lot of garbage put out for people to sift through.  When the printing press was invented, there was an outcry from the academics as to the amount of poorly written material that was coming out.</p><p>2. When the Internet made its way into the public consciousness there was some concern that anyone could publish anything.</p><p>3. God had a programming contest between the devil and Jesus.  As the deadline approached, the power went out.  When it came back on, the devil had no source code, so Jesus won because "Jesus Saves!"</p></div>
