		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt; This is assuming D.C. isn't under water tomorrow.</p><p>Yeesh.  My bike ride home was more than a little wet, which of course means that I match my basement now.  (Quick: what should you use to plug little holes in your basement wall when they are gushing spouts of water?  Right! Lots of glazing compound!  Who'd 'a thunk?)  Anyhow, since I made it home alive (as Billy Joel would say), the odds have greatly increased that I'll be able to greet you in person on Wednesday.  Hope you have good travel!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So, Raymond Camden, did you arrive at CFUNITED?  Please, give us an update.  We'd like to attend as planned, but the news reports make travel sound pretty rough. CNN has photos of hip-deep water in Bethesda, and CNBC says the Beltway was closed for mudslides yesterday! ... ?</p><p>I was hoping to attend your CFC session. :-)</p><p>Have any of the other speakers canceled, or will all events go on as scheduled?  Could you please update us on names of speakers who have canceled, if any?</p><p>Thanks for sharing any information you have.  Hope you've had a safe trip.</p><p>(Those lucky Brit bloggers are so excited about traveling to CFUNITED... I guess the weather reports haven't crossed the pond yet!)</p></div>
