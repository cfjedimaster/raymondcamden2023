		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know anything about the lemon law in LA, but I do know that in my experience they are designed to be hard to use. For instance, if I remember correctly, in Florida you had to have a car that had the exact same problem 3 times within like 90 days or something. So, in other words, your car could have a million problems, but so long as every time you brought it into the shop it was "determined" to be something "different", you could not invoke the lemon law. My grandfather once got his money back on a car, but only after alot of persistence and legal threats over many months (and in the end I beleive it was just the company caved and not the lemon law since as I discussed it was designed to be useless). Anyway, good luck...and really too sad because I have a Mini and love it :(</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray.. it actually could be bad gas.. gas does go bad if it sits in a tank for a long period of time, especially if there is some water and heat in the mix.  I've run up against this with motorcycles that aren't ridden much.  It also causes all kinds of problems because the gas will cause something like a shellac buildup on parts as it sits and ages.  I've bought several old motorcycles that ran like crap until I took the carburators apart and cleaned out the buildup left behind by the gas.</p><p>But.. your car is only a year old, and you run through a tank of gas every month or so, right?  So odds are that's not the problem.  The gas you bought could have been bad (water in it perhaps?) but not likely.</p><p>So, It may not be a gas or mechanical issue with the car that can be fixed... one of your reports mentioned moving it around in the driveway to let another car out.  Some of the newer engine/fuel systems have serious problems if you start them and then shut them off in too short a period (within a minute or so).  Later when you try to start them they won't start.</p><p>I've had two cars recently with that problem..  a Saturn and a Nissan.  I'd try to start them sometimes after they had been moved around in the driveway and they wouldn't start.  The solution for the Saturn was to hold the gas pedal to the floor and spin the starter for about 20secs and it would reset the ignition system and then it would start.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Has the car ever set without being started for more than 6 weeks?  Gas can go bad, especially if the quality of the gas was not top notch to begin with.  Things can happen like getting water in the gas or accidental contamination at the gas station when the delivery driver accidentally puts some diesel or kerosene into the gas storage tanks (the stations usually have hardware methods to prevent this from happening).</p><p>If your car (or lawnmower or anything that runs on gas) sits for extended periods you'll probably need to put in a gas stabilizer like Sta-Bil (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldeagle.com%2Fsta-bil%2F%29%3Aou-6VNJwF0dHmSK-TaOVAnoTWyE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.goldeagle.com/sta-bil/)">http://www.goldeagle.com/st...</a>.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Brad, the car was being driven rarely when the first problem occured. Once we discovered the car needed to br driven a lot, it was. So that can't be the issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, Mike brings up a great point. Today's cars cannot be run for a 'few minutes' or 'short distances' regardless of the gas used. Somethings happens with the fuel injectors and how gas is fed to them. I think it has something to with the vacuum pressure that feeds them. Perhaps they lose pressure when this is done?</p><p>Anyway, our Hyundai Santa Fe had similar problems. AAA came out to our house, pressed the gas pedal to the floor and cranked on the started for 20-30 seconds and the car started.</p><p>We haven't had a problem since.</p></div>
