		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, just an idea, but it would be great of BlogCFC had a branch that was reduced purely to a web/http service, that could put out all the blog data without requiring index.cfm's work.</p><p>Right now it seems BlogCFC can't work without index.cfm, why not let people develop their own front-ends? (Flash, FlexSpry, whatever.)</p><p>Just a thought.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>in fact it basically gives you the template of calls to the cfc that you would need in order to do that... making it easier, i think, to make my interface work with it...  what part isnt?</p></div>
