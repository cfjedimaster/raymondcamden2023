		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Spry does look really promising.  One of the easiest AJAX frameworks I have tried yet. I have not seen in any of the demos any examples of being able to use it to submit data to another page (cfc) from a text field (for example comments).  All the demos are focused on presenting (which it does really well).  Do you know of anyplace that shows how or if it can be done at all?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I only took a VERY cursory look at SPRY, so if I am incorrect, please just let me know (politely, if possible :)  - it LOOKS to me like SPRY is only a framework for creating dynamic tables?  No?  I mean, obviously, passing data to and from a backend app (CFC, obviously), but the front end it just a dynamic HTML table...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would not say table specific - but rather display specific. My demos also show drop downs and simple html areas that are bound to remote data. So don't just think of it as data.</p><p>There is also work being done in other areas. Remember this is still in early development. I can't comment on the other areas, but will blog more later when I can.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wouldn't make more aesthetic sense to put teh filter area under the libraries box, so the execute block is purely on the right.  This would increase legibility.  Just make the columns more narrow or reduce the font.  having to scroll down and over to see the data will bother folks.</p><p>I know this was a quick proof of concept, but just trying to make the demo more legible.  =)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray:</p><p>   Thanks for posting the filter example. I've adopted your example to output our member listing and let people type in the first part of a member's last name and the table filters out the rows that don't match.</p><p>   I changed your filter function to just search for the filter at the start of the last name.</p><p>   The filter works great and it a quick way for users to drill down to the data they want.</p><p>Bruce</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray:</p><p>  I modified your loading message.  I use a div tag that initially is hidden using this CSS:</p><p>div#notification {width: 400px; background: yellow; <br>padding: 10px; font-size:medium; <br>position:absolute;left:50px;top:200px;z-index:1;<br>visibility:hidden;}</p><p>Note the z-index and absolute positioning.</p><p>  Then I have this JavaScript function to toggle the visibility from hidden to visibile and from visible to hidden</p><p>function setNoticeVisibility( isVisible ) {</p><p>   var noteRegionStyle = document.getElementById('notification').style;</p><p>	if ( isVisible == true )<br>	   noteRegionStyle.visibility = 'visible';<br>	else<br>	   noteRegionStyle.visibility = 'hidden';</p><p>}//end function setNoticeVisibility</p><p>Then in the select's onchange I added this function call:</p><p>setNoticeVisibility(true); so that when the user selects an item the div tag will be visible with a nice message.  Instead of using a text message you could also have an animated GIF image.</p><p>Then I just call setNoticeVisibility(false) inside my OnDataChanged function:</p><p>var myObserver = new Object;<br>myObserver.onDataChanged = function(dataSet, notificationType) {<br>	setNoticeVisibility(false);<br>};</p><p>So when the table get fully populated based on the user's selection the div tag with the notice becomes hidden again.</p><p>Ray - thanks again for your postings on Spry.  You really helped me get going on it and applying it to our company intranet.</p><p>Bruce</p></div>
