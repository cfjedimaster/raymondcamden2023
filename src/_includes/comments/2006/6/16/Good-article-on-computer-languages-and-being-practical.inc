		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the real answer to the original question these days is that it depends on the framework you use.  We are now firmly coding in a more abstract age, call it The Rise of The Frameworks if you like.  Name any language and development task and the choice of language is just the beginning, Ruby has Rails, CF has Model-Glue (itself mash of ColdSpring and Reactor), Java (well there are many, but let's use a stack) Hibernate/Spring/Webwork.  The practicality of language design is superceeded by another layer of abstraction in the form of coding best practices, and frameworks.  And it's worth remembering that CF itself is compiled into Java.  In that regard one might also categorize it as a highly specialized java framework albeit, one for which Adobe extracts a handsome profit..</p></div>
