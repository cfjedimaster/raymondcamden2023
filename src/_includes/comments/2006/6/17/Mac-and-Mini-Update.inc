Oh - and she is missing a few keys as well"</p><p>Hehe, sounds exactly like the old Dell laptop that I've recently replaced with a iMac (lamp style, 2nd iteration) that I bought on eBay for the wife and kids to email and surf with.</p><p>Not only is the iMac faster than the Dell, even though it's only a G4 800mhz, but it's a thing of beauty to behold - a design classic!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i just received my 2gb of ram for my black MacBook yesterday from Newegg ($180). I popped it in, and everything is so incredibly fast and smooth. It was before, but now those Dual Core's have some room to gallop. Additionally, parallels is so quick now! Windows XP installed in less than 15 minutes and running it is a charm as well. I can't even tell, it is virutalized.</p></div>

In their mind, the repairs had been made and that was that.'</p><p>Smells of a way to stop you from proceeding to me.  In NJ, where my brother-in-law fought Ford becasue of a lemon, deciding whether the repairs were done, and whether the car was a lemon or not, was not up to the manufacturer.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry to hear this is such a hassle for you bro. <br>My wife and I are christians and believe strongly in the power of prayer and have seen it wok much on our own personal lives. We have lifted this situation up in prayer for you and are believing for a resolution to turn about in your favor! There is no reason you should have to deal with this garbage at all much less have to deal with a lawyer as well on top of it. : ) You have been a blessing to me in the past and a huge help with CF development etc. This is the least we can do for you. : )<br>We look forward to hearing how this situation turns around for you!</p><p>God Bless,<br>Josh &lt;&gt;&lt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know, it wasn't until the third paragraph that I realized you were talking about your car and not a Mac mini :)</p><p>Sorry to hear about all the problems you're having with the car, but congrats on the macbook! Or congrats to your wife at least. I'm slowing convincing my wife that macs are a good idea, but she's not there yet. Another six months or so and I ought to have her far enough along to order her one. And then a month or two after that maybe a new mini (Mac) to hook up to the TV.</p></div>
