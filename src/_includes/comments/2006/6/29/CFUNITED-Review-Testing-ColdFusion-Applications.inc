		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I was in the 1-day version of that class on Tuesday and it was extremely informative.  I will certianly be applying some of those methodologies to my work when I get home. (Who am I kidding... I have already applied some from the hotel room!) :)</p><p>One of the big things I want to tie together is when I do a commit into SVN, I want it to fire my Selenium testing, and if it is successful then push the current good svn version to a live spot.  I haven't gotten that all mapped out in my head in how to actually make that a reality yet, but it seems like a nice plan.</p></div>
