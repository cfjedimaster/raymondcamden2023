		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is this little button that comes with E-V-E-R-Y TV, it's called the "Power Button".  It's usually red.  Push it, see what happens.  If that doesn't work, it's called get up - walk across the room - and pull out the plug.  Tada!</p><p>Instant V-Chip.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just one more reason why I do not like government regulation (in any industry).  Consumers have the ultimate regulation authority, their wallets.</p><p>However, someone, somewhere filed a lawsuit that claimed their child's behavior was influenced by TV.  The judge, jury, and appellate courts bought it hook, line, and sinker.  Now, the FCC feels they have to mandate what can and can't be watched on TV so as not to harm fragile minds.  So once again, how much freedom are you willing to give up for your safety?  Or better yet, are you willing to let someone else decide how much freedom you should give up for your safety?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It All begins in the home, with the parents.J. dahmer, J wayne casey, ect. didn't have tv or video game 'influence' their motivations. I'm sick of everybody blaming 'somebody else for their own ineptness or reasons for lack of taking responsibility<br>on everyone else. The ones Who own the TV are in fact their own 'network programmers' and if they are too lazy to 'learn to use it, then that reflects on their own interest in raising a child.<br>You can't teach a boy to play catch if you are unwilling to go out into the yard with him! likewise, you can't bitch about programming if you don't make the effort to learn options given to you(v- chip).<br>If these 'People' Didn't have children, then they probably would bitch about their neighbor breathing 'Their' Oxygen !!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am a preschool teacher and a child in my class has told many other kids "F**K you." I found out his favorite movie is Meet the Fockers and his mom just says he doesn't understand it. IS SHE STUPID OR WHAT!? Parents need to  take responsibility for their OWN children and not tell the FCC or the cable companies to clean up the shows they offer that other ADULTS have the right to watch!! EVERYONE has a remote/ buttons on the TV, and fingers... SO CHANGE THE CHANNEL! AND know what YOU are paying for. The 2 and 3 yr olds in my class should NOT be exposed to cursing at school because another parent doesn't have half a brain to control what her child watches!!</p></div>
