		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree that <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexperts-exchange.com%3Alctnwg9M7Gt9bMb6WpLa2kckDI0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="experts-exchange.com">experts-exchange.com</a> is a waste of space in my search results. If they had exclusive solutions, then I wouldn't be annoyed with them and might even pay for membership. But what I hate is how they pretend that their service is worth paying for when you can find the same answer somewhere else.</p><p>Since Ray brought up the Firefox search bar, what I've always wondered is why the search bar isn't editable via some simple dialog box. Instead, you have to install and uninstall "search plugins" to make changes to the list. These "plugins" are just simple text files (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmycroft.mozdev.org%2Fdeepdocs%2Fquickstart.html%29%3A7w__4jZCk_ToJfb5bHAfzokhAcM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/quickstart.html)">http://mycroft.mozdev.org/d...</a> that could be easily edited by Firefox. I wonder if they make it harder to change because the Mozilla Foundation collects referral fees from some searches.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, it's for the search box in the upper right. For Google's toolbar, you'd have to figure out the right javascript file that sends the request to Google and then recompile the xpi. The good news is that it (and the jar in the chrome folder) can be opened up with WinZip. I'm not sure if Google wants us hacking their code like this though...GoogleLite might allow it though.</p></div>

You have to scroll all the way down below the monstrosity of ads that make it look like it's the footer when it's really not. I went to this link using your search results:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.experts-exchange.com%2FWeb%2FWeb_Languages%2FJavaScript%2FQ_20696473.html%3AKKLWfC0CtDG6Nv5qbB5f6Z3HrJ4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web/Web_Languages/JavaScript/Q_20696473.html">http://www.experts-exchange...</a></p><p>You'll see a (usually) pretty thorough discussion of the question. Note that I tried this in both IE and Firefox (too see if it was a HTML rendering issue).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I recently started blocking cookies from most sites unless I really need to allow them.</p><p>Turning on cookies for EE seems causes it to set 6 or 7 cookies.

They have recently changed something to do with viewing their answers with cookies but as one guy said using Google's "Cached" link instead of the main link will still work (until the next indexing no doubt).</p><p>I'm sure its a strategic money making initiative, but if anyone has any idea of how to get all of their members and solutions to somewhere unrestricted I'm on board!</p></div>

It's 10 dollars month, unless your EARN premium services.  If you earn PS, than it's free.  you have 2 months to keep your PS status by answering the minimum number of points (3000 per month).</p><p>but mike, yes you're right, we do think you're an idiot.</p><p>furthermore you don't have to suscribe to see the answer.  just scroll down past the ads.  and the reason phil called your retarded is because you didn't scroll down to the answer was at the bottom of the page.  you call the site useless. we call your brain useless, hence the word retarded.</p><p>there's a reason why google has EE TA answers ranked High.</p><p>noobs.</p><p>but its better that you ee haters stay away. cause we don't want you to show up in a google search on EE</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Folks. If this topic cannot stay polite, I will disable comments. There is no reason to curse. I find it odd that the the EE supporters, though, are the ones who are mainly being rude. I hope that this is not indicitive of the type of people who contribute to the site. Either way - I believe we can discuss EE w/o being rude. If not, I'll simply close down the discussion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice thread Raymond. I too am annoyed by EE always popping up in the top of searches only to find them pimping their wares. As for you EE users who are calling names...nice representation of the contributing EE users. Way to really show your maturity.</p><p>I think the general irritation with EE is that when people are looking for a solution to a problem, they expect to be presented with an answer, not to be given a site that tries to coerce the user into buying a service. As information technology professionals we have come to rely on answers to our questions answered by our peers, not by some money making machine. As an IT professional, when I come across that site, I find the tone rude, greedy, and generally distasteful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm pretty sure the reason you're getting flamed by some of the EE Lounge lizards, is because your entire blog in anti-EE.</p><p>the facts are this:  <br>1)None of the users of EE get paid to be there.<br>2)You don't have to suscribe to see the answers. <br>3)If you want to do a search from WITHIN EE (using EE's search engine), then you have to suscribe.<br>4)Subscription is FREE.<br>5)Premium services are $10 a month, unless you earn them (which is rather easy for anybody that knows anything about computers).<br>6)Ads are visible when you don't have premium services.  Again, premium services can be earned and maintained monthly.  I've been a member for 4 years and have yet to pay a dime.<br>7)We have some of the worlds top experts in the EE community.<br>in fact, the author of this site(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amset.info%3AGcttzEt9aYtuMeHVyPddSKFiMsE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.amset.info">http://www.amset.info</a>) is a Microsoft MVP.  That's just an example of the talent that supports EE.</p><p>the problem EE supporters have with your blog is it has inaccurate information.  She took a snap shot instead of looking at the big picture.</p><p>and finally, EE teaches people how to fish, instead of just giving them fish. They help people solve problems and learn how to solve problems rather than just giving them the answer.  Look at the Access forums for the largest number of examples.</p><p>My suggestion, is next time you want to right a negative blog, do a little research.  There's a reason EE comes up in many google searches.  And that's because somebody already asked your question, and the solution was found with help from ee.</p><p>good luck in your future endeavors.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>EE facts, can you please tell me what part of my blog entry was inaccurate? I said you have to sign up. Is that not true? Folks on this list pointed out that EE uses a cookie, and if you block the cookie, you do get the answers all the time, but the default behavior is to not show the answers after the cookie is set.</p><p>If that is wrong, please tell me and I'll gladly update the blog post. I do not understand why EE folks feel the need to attack this entry so much. I'm sure some folks love EE. Personally I don't care for it _when using Google_, which was the main point of the blog entry - how to remove sites from Google results.</p><p>You made the comment, EE teaches people how to fish - personally I think using Google is fishing. When I get a result from EE and can't read it until I sign up, I'd rather simply not use EE.</p><p>Why did you say none of the EE users get paid? I never said they did. I don't want to search within EE. I want to search within Google. It's great the subscription is free, but it means extra steps in my results from Google. To me, this is almost false advertising. The search result shows up, but you don't really get the answer until you logon. As for top experts - I never attacked the intelligence of the EE community.</p><p>Note that I was attacked (called retarded) by one of EE's members. I never turned this into a personal attack - EE defenders did. If this is representative of the type of people EE use, then I'm glad I don't go there often.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>AMEN! I hate that site! Occasionally it will pop up results without you having to sign up and/or pay. But it pisses me off that a pay site shows up all over the top ten search results for something. A little further googling with eventually find the answers you're looking for but it's a huge annoyance. How about if you just pay to get a question answered but then let the answer be freely available to all. Once when I was rich I paid to get on their crummy site but NONE of my questions were ever answered and my time expired.</p><p>And is it just me or does the site name look more like "expert sex change" hahaha</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is not obvious at all that one can just scroll down for the answer.  What you EE users don't get is that most (intelligent) people, when confronted with a sales pitch instead of an answer, are going to just close the page.  The reason for this is that we are so inundated on a daily basis with ads and sales pitches to buy this and buy that, that it has become second nature to blow it off.  How many times have you told the telemarketer, "take me off your list" (before the do-not-call list) without really hearing a word?  How many times have you fast-forwarded  through commercials on your DVR (or VCR for the old-schoolers)?  I'd say that most people don't like ads - most especially those that are noticeable and intrusive.  And Masquerading as a search result, (without an obvious notice stating that answers are at the bottom of the page) and then trying to sell us something is definitely intrusive.  Given that the internet was founded on the idea of free exchange of information and that the open source movement is gaining significant momentum, I think this is a terrible business model and a terrible first impression to make on a potential user.  But hey - maybe the owners of EE have money to burn.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep Experts Exchange is a rip off and a waste of time. Its interesting to see that this thread has being going I while - exactly the same search brought me here, trying to block it from my google searches. As people have pointed out, you can see some answers if you scroll down past the rubbish - sometimes. But then you get stuff which is no better than any newsgroups, worse sometimes. OK you might find something of use there, but the impression that they are trying to give to people is that they are 'experts' somehow, and will therefore give you an expert answer - this would fool those who aren't in the know. They are just a way for the owners of the site to profit from what used to be in newsgroups.</p><p>Come on - we have been newsgroups for years, for the community - by the community. I was a bit annoyed when dejanews got bought by google, but its totally free at least.</p><p>At the end of the day 'Experts' Exchange are trying to profit from the generosity of spirit that programmers have given each other for years. It would be great if everyone blocked their site in google!</p><p>(and those people defending EE - why so rude?)</p><p>I set Chris' link as my homepage now, but look into blocking more sites from google when I have time (like <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FAbout.com%3AwH7fPjiGjwDM2s-Pwx26zhXZmZM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="About.com">About.com</a>)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First you dont have to login or pay to see any answers just scroll all the way to the bottom.</p><p>last if you contribute and answer around 3 questions a month you NEVER HAVE TO PAY. EE is a great idea. if you are a lazy free loader then yes, you have to pay! if you are someone who like to share your ideas and help others 'just like the creator of this blog' then is a grate place. i have met many CF developers and lots of new friends on EE. 10 years + and still the most active community on-line of this type so it must be doing something right!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry Alex, but cookies prevent viewing the answer for "regular" google visitors.<br>EE is very "smart" in covering up the answers and forcing people to pay for something they can get for free at other sites.</p><p>As an EE expert you don't experience the "tricky" way to find out the way to become a free member. You need to know that you've to enlist as expert....</p><p>Many newsgroups do have better quality experts as EE and no flames and experts hunting for expert points.</p><p>I found better friends at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbytes.com%3AR-03qHr3hO_im9-fPJoNyYpNVnM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="bytes.com">bytes.com</a> and never ran into flames. Just wait till you're called names by a "colleague" expert and see what action the EE amins take... &lt;LOL&gt;</p><p>They do indeed something right, they are experts in covering up criticism. They follow the "Bush" doctrine: "Who's not for me is against me". And they are experts in misleading the innocent customers. Just run a search for a common CF mistake and count the number of broken links and irrelevant answers. Now check again the number of questions the advertise with to attract paying members....</p><p>For more info I would invite you to read my blog as stated in the above comment.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Nic;o)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can Crack any link of experts-exchange site , using Google Product Session , What i mean is you can still view those restricted answer right bottom of  the page (make sure page Loads Completely ) Only things should be experts-exchange Link which you Clicked from any Google Product ..</p><p> For Eg ..<br>  1.If u find any useful experts-exchange Link in GOOGLE Search,, you can see all those obfuscated answer at the bottom of the page . <br>  2. KEy Feature to Crack(another Approach) <br>If u search solution in the experts-exchange sites itself , this time its Hurts by which u will find all answers in Locked State i mean cant able to see those answers . What Should be done is ....<br>  Just Copy that link and save the link in your Gmail Account . <br>ANd Click that pasted Link from your Gmail Account . Now You can see those answers at the bottom....<br>  I bet there are really some better Solution in that Site...</p><p>ve Fun</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just wqant to pass on a thanks for this.  EE is annoying at the least, your hack worked very well for me as they no longer show as a result.  Although the google.src file on my computer was located in C:\Program Files\<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmozilla.org%3A4S-6lu53L8OQSfGnyCiYwV9qh2o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>\SeaMonkey\searchplugins, a copy of it placed in the folder mentioned and edited as instructed worked like a charm.  Thanks again, I agree that if the information is free somewhere else then why pay for it?</p></div>
