		<div class="comment_text"><p>don't worry if you have to go to a 12th article 'cause i've been stapling them all together in threes anyway. Besides 12 is such an even number: 12 eggs(beans) in a dozen, 12 months in a year, 12 apostles, you get the idea... and if you have to go beyond that, you can always say you are doing everything in hexidecimal.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>the question that comes to mind when you talk about leaving out deleting and updating the images in that gallery it sounds like the feature will be left out as well as the article that covers it, is that right? I just recently learned how to use cffile and cfdirectory to (Aargh) allow users to upload screenshots to my helpdesk app and to allow admins to haphazardly delete them, am I going to miss out on learning anything new?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond</p><p>New to MG:U and just been following your tutorial. At the end of part 9, I noticed that, having uploaded a photo to the app and settled back on the gallery page, if you hit 'refresh', the image gets uploaded again.</p><p>How can I prevent this? Do I need to clear the variable names in some way?</p><p>Rgds,</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mick - I'm actually a bit rusty now on my memory of this - but if you add a redirect="true" to the XML for the event handling the upload, it should prevent this. If I didn't use that (which it sounds like I didn't), I may have been having a senior moment.</p><p>When MG2 is _officially_ done I'm going to do a new series. Probably not as complex as this one though. (Got to give people _some_ reason to hire me for training. :)</p></div>
