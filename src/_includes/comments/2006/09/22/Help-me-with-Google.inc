		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the same issue when I recently added Amazon's add service to my site.  The page would pause during loading to get their ads.  It was even happening when I loaded the page from localhost.</p><p>I'm going to play with the idea of loading the ads deadlast on the page then using javascript to take the ad code and write it where I want in the page using div.innerHtml.  Hopefully, that will allow all my content to load and then the user won't notice the ads are waiting to load at the bottom.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Your site is slower. I tested in IE and Firefox.</p><p>I am going to propose this now, and see if anyone likes the idea. Someone should start an ad network for ColdFusion or programming sites. Adsense is dependant on Google to do a javascript response to your page as it loads. If the ads could be syndicated through the same server that is displaying the page, the response would be a lot faster, and Google would not be able to hoard all of the ad money.</p><p>Just a thought,<br>David.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>Here two possible solutions:</p><p>1. You can try is to wrap a DIV around the Google Adsense Javascript code and set the style.display to "none" by default. This prevents the code from being loaded with the rest of the HTML. Then when the page is fully loaded you change style.display to "block" to start showing ads.</p><p>2. One other things you can try is to have a DIV on the place you want to show the Google Adsense but leave the DIV empty. Then when the page is fully loaded you use innerHTML to full the DIV with the Google Adsense Javascript code to start showing the ads.</p><p>One of these solutions should fix your problem :-).</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Erwin Verdonk</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Guys - I did some testing locally with the "hide the ads" test and using onLoad to reshow the ads. This SEEMS to work, but does a bit of 'content jerking' on load. But - thats better than waiting. I'm going to deploy this change when I get back from picking up my son. Again - I'd appreciate some help testing when I'm done.</p><p>Note - I definitely appreciate everyone's help, ESPECIALLY since this is just for my ads. I know most folks hate ads - but I'm happy no one has (yet) ripped me a new one for not just removing the ads.</p><p>Again - thanks.</p><p>I'll post when I have the change up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Glad it appears to solve the issue. I got another question. Since when are you using gravatar? I notice in my HTTP debugger that gravatar often fails to load and thus slows down the rendering of your page since it has to timeout first.</p><p>This might as well cause the problem instead of stats or Google stuff.</p><p>Regards,<br>Erwin</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I've noticed intermittently since the start of your new design that it sometimes renders very slowly. Sometimes the pause occurs before the left column renders, and sometimes it's the gravatars that take too long to load. My guess is that there's something in your CSS layout that's the source of the issue. It may have to do with slow response times from Google or <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FGravatar.com%3AtvFghmc7ClK-IaIldQBFTQEAfsM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Gravatar.com">Gravatar.com</a>, but I personally think that the solution lies with your CSS.  Have you tried testing two pages with identical content, identical ads, and identical gravatars, but one with tables and the other with CSS?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gravatar was added a few versions ago. I've been talking about replacing it. The idea is sound - the server behind it is sucky. I don't mean to rip on them - but they don't seem to have any plans to add to their infrastructure.</p><p>Ok - I am uploading my change in 60 seconds. If folks could test again, I'd appreciate it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's all time really. A friend and I have plans for it - we even have a domain. I just need to code it. As I said - I think Gravatar is a good idea in general - they simply are just not doing a good job. Now I'm sure it is hard to keep up with demand - but shoot - if you can't - you should just quit. (Which may be a bit harsh.)</p></div>
