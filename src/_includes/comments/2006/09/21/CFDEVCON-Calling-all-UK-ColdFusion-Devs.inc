		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I WISH GBP40 was under USD60 - would make my Edinburgh travels sooooo much cheaper. As it is, Ednburgh makes MANHATTAN look cheap! Luckily we have UK clients as well, so we're making some money in both currencies.</p><p>Ray, are you actually attending? I was planning to be in NYC, but if enough of the right people are going . . . I see Mark Drew will be presenting CF Eclipse which is always nice . . .</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry for underestimating the the currency rate - although I still think the price is a steal. :)</p><p>Peter: I wish. If someone wants to pay my way and my work doesn't mind, then sure. :)</p><p>Vince: I've toyed with the idea for a while. It was nice having a small regional conference near by... and "small" isn't even fair, I do seem to remember a good sized turn out. I'll let you know if I get any further with the idea.</p></div>
