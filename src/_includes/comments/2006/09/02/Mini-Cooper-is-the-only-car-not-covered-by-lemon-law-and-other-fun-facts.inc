I find it really insane that someone like him would consistently blame customers for messing their car up when it seems to be that all of these customers' cars seem to consistently have the same issues that make this particular model a lemon.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>barry: I think you have a good point - but I don't know if my little blog would scare them. I mean - sure - I'm a big name (forgive me if that sounds egotistical) in this small CF realm, but probably next to nothing in the real world.</p><p>Then again - it wouldn't hurt to bring it up. Sometimes the #s sound a lot more impressive than what they are. (Ie, I can say this blog gets 50K+ hits per month, which isn't the same as 50K+ people, but...)</p></div>

People like good ideas (like the red-paperclip guy, or the 1-million-hits-for-a-3some fella), and don't like to get screwed over so if you were to market it correctly, I reckon you could get a huge following, and frighten even the biggest of companies.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been reading about your Mini troubles for a while now, Ray, and as always I'm sorry to hear that it continues to be a problem. My husband and I have had a Mini for almost 3 years now and really like that little car. No serious troubles, and minor things that came up (air conditioning on the fritz) have been handled promptly by the dealer.  I wish I had some idea why your experience has been so bad. I guess the local dealer must really share a major part of the blame.  I do understand that a certain amount of "frogging" where the transmission is a bit jerky at very low speeds is normal because of the CVT software, if you have an automatic.  It does seem to get better as you drive it for a while and the software trains to your acceleration pattern; also we found it improved considerably after a firmware update.  Maybe the "not driving enough" has something to do with that.  Anyway, good luck and hope that you'll eventually get what you need from all this.</p></div>

I am SO frustrated with Brian Harris.   Did you ever get your problems solved?  Did you end up going the lemon law route?  I would be very interested to know how it worked out for you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is not about the Mini Cooper but about Brian Harris BMW/Baton Rouge, LA.  I purchased a 1992 BMW 525I for my son in March or April of this year. When I purchased it they gave me a 30 day warranty.  During that time the Check Engine light came on.  I contacted the salesman and brought the car into the dealership to be checked.  The salesman contacted me a couple of days later and stated that they checked the car out and their was no problem with the engine.  I went into pick up the car and the salemans who I had been dealing with was not there.  Service brought the car to me and I asked if the engine had been checked.  The man told me they had no instructions to check the engine.  I told him to take the car back and run the diagnostic test on the engine.  He did and determined the car needed an oxygen sensor.  I told him to fix it and I wasn't paying for it and he told me I had to speak with the sales manager to get it approved.  I did and they fixed it.  Here's the lesson I learned.  Sometimes it's the car and sometimes it's the dealership.  If you purchased a car that's a lemon a good dealership can make all the difference in the world.  I won't  ever purchase another car from Brian Harris BMW, nor will anybody I know, if I can help it.   These dealerships should know that the way people are treated can have residual damage.  Hit them in the pockets and sue if necessary.</p></div>
