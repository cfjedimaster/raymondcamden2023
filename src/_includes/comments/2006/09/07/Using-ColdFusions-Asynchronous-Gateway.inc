		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agree? Of course I agree. I've been asking Adobe to make Async gateways a part of every version of CF (even if limited in pro). They are fantastic and makes someone really think about how code works and how it can be 'cut up'.</p><p>I have 2 async gateways running on HoF. The first is a logging gateway and let me tell you it is super fast and cool. If I had to do these logging operations inside a user session it would bog down the user. Sending a small packet of info to a async gateway to be precessed and logged is a speed savings that can be measured in an order of magnitude.</p><p>The second is a digest sender for my lists (which I just fixed - hidden, non-vared variable in a cached environment is deadly). When you have to process 50+ lists with about 10 digests options per list on an hourly basis, an async gateway is perfect.</p><p>Let me get something up on Blog of Fusion about the digest gateway now and then get the FAQU article up asap.</p><p>(as a side note, I'm revising my old list of CF functions into some better docs. I'll send you that as soon as I'm done as well.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hello,</p><p>It seems that I am being 'tricked' as you say.<br>I'm getting my feet wet using Async Gateways with CF8, and I have created a loop which calls the gateway X amount of times.<br>The gateway request then logs the data, however, it is logging X requests, but only the actual data from the last request in the loop.  Thus, it's populating the table with duplicate records of the last request X amount of time from the loop.</p><p>I may be mistaken, but it seems as though it's sharing the same thread as it is being overwritten with the latest request, rather than creating individual threads for each request.

Why is the gateway limiting us to storing our CFCs in the gateway folder for the CF Server installation drive? For various reasons we do not store project files on it. Can this be edited?
