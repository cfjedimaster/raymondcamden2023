		<div class="comment_text"><p>It amazes me how a nation that claims to not be religious can be so into figuring out the truths about a show like this. What is the truth? They hang on and dig and scratch for understanding a reality of it. (But there is NO reality to Lost.) Yet, when someone is passionate about a religious faith we chide them because it can be grouped into "religion". You would think that religion was the key by which we invalidate anything. You would think religion had no foundation because there are unknowns and unprovens. (Yet, again... look at the heart of America's love for Lost.) Is the issue the reality of religion, or is it the effect of the conclusions?</p></div>

I'm an athiest and you don't see me posting messages asserting my opinion that there is no god. This subject has no place in a programming discussion so please stop.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Brian, I will be glad to answer you questions. You seem to be at minimum not understanding that I DID NOT push any religious beliefs. (Religion definition: &gt;&gt;&gt;  A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. &lt;&lt;&lt; Not all religion is spiritual. Lost has a "cult" following. My terms were appropriate and related to the topic.)</p><p>You have a temporary right to be an atheist, just as is retrospect I have the same right to be a believer.</p><p>On the subject of "prattle"... that is because you don't believe it is real. So what is prattle for you is your opinion just as you believe this is my opinion. So, why prattle about my prattle if you believe prattle is wrong?</p><p>Lastly, if the basis is that my comment has nothing to do with programming, certainly you are wise enough to see that you would also be against the original topic. The topic wasn't programming.</p><p>Now, I ascent the human right to determine truth with personal accountability. If you feel you have validated there is no God, that is your responsibility. I won't begrudge you that responsibility, or Ray or others.  The point of my post if you would review it was that we are so religious about truths that are not truths, yet so agnostic about something that might be truth. If you don't see it, then count it up as a wrong perspective. Again... my concluding question wasn't answered. "Is the issue the reality of religion, or is it the effect of the conclusions?"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Being a leader in the Christian community, a member of the ColdFusion community, and the part of Lost fan base, I fail to understand what the pursuit of the "truth" of a drama's secrets has to do with the failure of society to purse real truth and meaning. Perhaps it is a good point for another discussion or even a discussion on Mr. Eko's religious path, but this is not the point of Ray's post.</p><p>I too assert the right for you and I to share religious views just as much as I would assert our rights to discuss frameworks. But if the post has nothing to do with either, it seems to be a bit fruitless to contribute to the honest debate of ideas when no one asks you to. It's a bit like going to MAX 2006 and debating evolution versus Intelligent Design. Wrong time, wrong place. Interjecting yourself into a topic under false pretenses does not build trust among the audience. Now here I go, contributing to a post off-topic just to respond to an off-topic post. Apologies to Ray and all of the other readers who wanted to comment on Lost.</p><p>And just to correct the record since you brought it up, most of the nation (United States) does claim to be religious. They self identify with having religious affiliations at a rate of about 85%. 15% claim no religious  affiliation or are atheist/agnostic. These percentages are not made up, but were provided by the last census. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDemographics_of_the_United_States%3Ac6L4pU9GmQ_kNAZW9p04BB2AxG0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a></p><p>Now I do have a question regarding the YouTube video, do you think this was put out by a Lost fan? It seems to me if it was a genuine spoiler the same scientist from the series would appear in the video - or am I missing the point?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Speaking of being religious... I would have you consider other facts. America to the delight of those seeking freedom of pulpit controlled politics will be delighted to hear that religious attendance in our country is declining. We are following the trend of our mother country, England and the UK in general. Religion by affiliation is like someone saying they have affiliation with Lost because their father watches it! LOL, please. <br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.umich.edu%2Fnews%2Findex.html%3FReleases%2F1997%2FDec97%2Fchr121097a%3A81X_0z48aZGPVsvTjjbuwT4tcTU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/1997/Dec97/chr121097a">http://www.umich.edu/news/i...</a><br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Frel_USA.html%23gallup%3AoAcd1ujmQ86H8y7Y2u_Ayz-mzys&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html#gallup">http://www.adherents.com/re...</a></p><p>Someone is giving you bad numbers, and you need to get out of the classroom if that is where you are getting your figures. Nearly anyone in the CF community would tell you that "85% identify" figures is not religious but associative.</p><p>My point was associative to the topic. Not planning to take it off where you guys keep pointing it. My point is simple. The Lost cult is Star Trek like. Religious affiliation is not on the level with some of the extreme Star Wars groupies who have gone as far as seeking to become Jedi Knights. (And yes, there are multiple reports of this out there.) I am not even commenting about how the ethics of the production effect how a Christian reflects the name of Christ. (Someone should set you straight on this, but if you are where you are and still don't know this... it's vain to try. I will say publically that your stand would be conflict. If you reply here I am willing to take that point to debate on my Blog. Just respond shortly here and I will pass the link. This I agree is Ray's space and in honor to him I don't want to debate specific religious issues here.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well Kevin. Perhaps you should consider your own values as a proclaimed 'christian' and watching lost. Certainly redeeming the time should be our priority as believers. If you have time for shows like lost that contridict values that you and I claim to uphold by 'association' with the Bible... I will keep the offer open for debate.</p></div>
