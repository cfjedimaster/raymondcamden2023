		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's nice to know a bug I posted about is getting fixed so quickly :) Any idea when the next release will be? I had originally built this for a project that is now past deadline and that I had to rip the spry out of because of the pagination/sort issue and go with a different, much less efficient process. I'd love to be able to add the spry back in to my project by the next release.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Will, I can't really comment on that. However, let me ping my contact to see if you can use the fix. I mean, technically, you could just view source on my code and download right now. I assume you are aware of that. :)</p></div>
