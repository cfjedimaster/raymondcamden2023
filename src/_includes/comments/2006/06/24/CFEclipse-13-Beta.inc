I use it jsut to enter images (as it figures out the width and height)</p><p>If I remember right (I did this a while ago) if you drag an image you get a img tag, a js, you get a script tag and a css you get a &lt;link tag, anything else just gets put as a &lt;a</p><p>I am going to double check now but I am sure I put that in this release.</p><p>MD</p></div>

It really wasn't meant as a personal attack, and I'll admit that I've never looked at your blog (I think it may be your view on frameworks that keeps me away, but I'm a convert). I look forward to looking at what you have available. And, I owe you a beer as well;).</p><p>Ray, my apologies as well. It really wasn't meant to be personal. Just 5AM-beginning-first-cup-of-joe kneejerk kinda thing (I really have to watch that...;) )</p></div>
