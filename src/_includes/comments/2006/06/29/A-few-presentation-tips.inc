		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's one that I've noticed a bit too frequently at the conference so far: Please don't read your slides verbatim and provide little to no supplemental explanation. I can read with my eyes far faster than you can read it aloud, and I have all the slides in front of me already.</p><p>The great part about Adam's preso that you liked as much as I did was that the bullet points were just talking points for his filler material, which is where the meat of the presentation was. Very well done.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Maybe only 10% of the presenters were following Ray's advice about PowerPoint font size. Of all the Eclipse code examples we squinted through, I saw only 3 who had changed the Eclipse default font.</p><p>Then there was the guy running his examples in Firefox. When an audience shout-out suggested he increase his browser font, he agreed, but didn't know how.</p></div>
