		<div class="comment_text"><p>very interesting! I am looking into using this for one of my CF Shared Hosting boxes, I could see this being very handy...although doesn't this replace the version of JVM that CF comes with? I thought that would void the warranty :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No it does not. It simply adds a new servlet to work with CF. To be honest, I'm not 100% sure. I think it would safe w/o worrying about voiding your warranty. At worst, a call with CF support may ask you to remove FR and return to a "virgin" install (if that makes sense).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My company has been using Fusion Reactor for a couple of months now and it's been invaluable on both our development servers and our production servers to track down issues and pinpoint which applications have caused lockups or crashes because of badly written code, SQL or quirky third party JDBC drivers.</p><p>We tested SeeFusion and found it to be far less user friendly than Fusion Reactor with several missing features compared to the 1.0.x of Fusion Reactor.  The only obvious benefit, JDBC query tracing, has been added into the Fusion Reactor 2.0 release.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi All,</p><p>FusionReactor doesn't change your JVM. FusionReactor supports Java 1.5 as well as 1.4.2, but it doesn't force you to change and all of the features are available on either JVM.</p><p>Stack Tracing on Solaris is supported in FR2.</p><p>We are going to release FR1 Solaris native libs soon, so that you can get stack traces on Solaris with FR1.</p><p>URL rewrites are slated for a later release (not in FR2).</p><p>Ray, thanks for this post, and the feedback!</p></div>

Manual installation is possible on all other platforms.</p><p>FusionReactor will scan and detect all of the different server types on a machine and install itself with one-click from the instance manager into the servers you select.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been meaning to look at something like this for ages, and didn't really have the time to look at it so thanks ray.</p><p>One question I do have is, if you have set up multi-servers do you need a license for each cf instance? Is is it for thw whole base system no matter how many instances.</p><p>The next question then is the way we have our clusters set up is as a hot stand by sharing the same e:\ where the instances are stored, Does this mean for a single cluster we would need 2 licenses as they are different servers but only one is running at a time (We have bought CF for each node even though only one runs at one time)</p><p>Once again Thanks Rays</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hello,<br>1. You need a single license per physical server - it doesn't matter how many instances are on that server, they're all covered.</p><p>2. You also require a license for the 'hot standby' server as this is also a separate box.</p><p>I would recommend the FusionReactor Enterprise edition in your case - as this includes the Enterprise Dashbaord, which shows a realtime 'health' status of your production environment (all registered servers/instances) from a single window.   Note: FusionReactor also supports J2EE applications e.g. JBoss, Tomcat as well as CF</p></div>
