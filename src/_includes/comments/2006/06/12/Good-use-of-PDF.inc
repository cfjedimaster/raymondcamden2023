		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you have Adobe Acrobat Professional 7 (not the reader), there is a new feature called "Typewriter" that lets you fill out any PDF form print it, save it, etc.  It is a relatively unkown feature that was rolled out in the .05 update.   It makes PDFs truly useful</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>PDF forms (FDF) can be submitted to a CF server. No need for Livecycle on that point alone. In fact you can buy Adobe Pro and put additional business logic into your PDF forms with fancier form elements and validation logic. It is when you go to the ultimate level of integration you gain benefit of using Livecycle. Microsoft has a simular tier product called InfoPath. They are seeking to capture some of the Livecycle market. (Adobe needs to do a better job marketing to the public that they have such a product! The silence is giving MS an edge in the market.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In my experience, the issue is a little more complicated than enabling the form features in Acrobat Pro...</p><p>That assumes that the person creating the form knows about the feature, uses an input field with the correct type (rather than a line of underscores ____ ) and additionally uses a database to store the results rather than a paper folder or Excel. (sigh)</p><p>At least Adobe is making it easier for those of us who have to go behind and improve usability for the visitors</p></div>
