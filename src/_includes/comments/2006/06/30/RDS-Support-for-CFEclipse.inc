		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I could not find the plug-in for eclipse installed anywhere by the ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 update.  I did however find the plug-in was unpacked to the install files location when running the Flex Builder 2.0 install package.  Although the plug-in could be added to my current Eclipse 3.1.2 installation it would not connect to a testing server over the internet.  A local virtual machine running as a development server it was able to connect to successfully.  The only difference between the two servers was that the local instance was running version 7.0.2 and the remote server was running the old version 7.0.1 update and that one was on the local network and one was over the internet.  The remote server I was able to connect to via both Dreamweaver 8 and the ColdFusion Report Builder.  Do you know if you have to be running the 7.0.2 update on a ColdFusion server to be able to use the Eclipse RDS support plug-in?</p><p>Az</p></div>

Where would i find this on my OSX setup, having installed the 7.02 update?</p><p>And by the way, it seems that Adobe has released the source code for FlexBuilder 2 . . .

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>The ColdFusion Extensions for Flex Builder 2.0 are packaged with the Flex Builder download.  If these are truly going to be made available on a permanent basis as a free tool for Flex and CFEclipse users they should package it up for download and make it available in the same tools area where the ColdFusion Report Builder and ColdFusion Extension for Dreamweaver are made available for individual download.  An ever better idea would be to bring a live update online to distribute bug fixes and bleeding edge releases to those willing to work with beta versions.</p><p>I've narrowed my RDS connectivity issues down, it appears as though it works fine to ColdFusion MX 6.0 servers and above, even over an internet link as long as the internet link is not Hughesnet/Direcway.  I live in a rural area and that is the only access available other than dial-up.  There seems to be some connectivity issue between the Java based Eclipse IDE and my connection.  This issue doesn't exist with the ColdFusion Report Builder or Dreamweaver 8.</p><p>Az</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I figured out (sort of) my RDS problem.</p><p>It has something to do with the "Context Root".  We do have some password protected directories on some of our sites so I thought I could change the Context Root from the path to one of our sites to just the root of the C drive (C:\ or c:). Still no luck. Then I tried the root of D (d:\ or d:) still not luck.  So I left that field blank and it worked.</p><p>So if you know RDS is configured properly and DWCS3 connects with the same settings just leave the "Context Root" field blank.</p><p>I confirmed this on my laptop.  As long as the "Context Root" field is blank it works.</p></div>
