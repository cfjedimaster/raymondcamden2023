		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love flash forms. They ARE slower so in some applications I actually have both html and flash forms... I didn't think anyone would use the flash version because they were so much slower but they do. Flash player 9 will speed up flash forms dramatically (although they will still be slower). I have been forced to learn a little ActionScript to get them to do some stuff which was scary at first but it's growing on me. The problem with the cfgrid is you can't do a combo box and that's a deal-killer for editable grids. I too am thinking Flex will be where I turn for complex user interfaces in the future.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I spent quite a bit of time modifying the Real Estate example to fit my need for an inventory management system for an online store. It came out exactly as you describe, Ray. It was very cool, I could do things that were very hard or impossible with DHTML. I learned some ActionScript and some things about Flash. In the end, I discovered that it was about 80% of what I wanted, and every new feature I added would be days of work due to my lack of knowledge of Flash/AS and some of the limitations of the tool. I still think Flash forms are cool, but I'm much more conservative when I use them. Not sold on Flex yet, but watching carefully.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I went through a similar process as you did. Once I saw what ASFusion was doing, I wanted to use Flash Forms everywhere, but then not only do they load somewhat slow (which wasn't a big deal when you could incorporate alot of functionality on a single page without page loads using remoting), but I spent so much time debugging arcane issues mostly having to do with trying to make Flash Forms do things they were not originally intended to do (for example, I remember spending way too much time trying to get around the inability to use "new"). In the end, I still like them, but in limited use.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>flashforms are great, we've pretty much been able to do what we needed doing w/them, just usually needed some more AS (which makes you learn AS). w/flashforms we only have one rule, you never submit them. these things should be the app's UI, not 100% replacements for HTML forms.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I really like what flash forms can do. Like Ray said, they are a great way to quickly create a robust calendar control or grid. I've done some apps that do considerably more than that, and its a fairly painful process, working around limitations, some puposefully built into CF. I've worked with Flex2 a fair amount, and I'm excited about the doors that will open up. Obviously, flex gets around all the limitations that flash forms have built into them. You might say that your options are more flexible? No? Wow. I couldnt resist.</p><p>Anyways, with the overhead of Flex and flash forms, I have adopted a policy of only using them for internal apps. On internal apps that I've worked on, I can generally assume that the form/movie will be loaded and a fair amount of interaction will take place, making the initial loading overhead worthwhile. As for public sites and projects, I'd rather stay away from loading an entire flash movie for what might be a single view.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've found Flash forms in CF almost completely useless unless you use Remoting to retreive and store data from them without reloading the page.</p><p>Doing this I've created forms that a user can perform a search with and return the results into a grid without a page reload which is a great time saver.</p><p>I've also created much more complicated forms that are incredible time savers because they let the user do so much without having to load and submit a dozen different forms.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Excellent post.  I too found myself "flash form happy" with the release of CF7, but have almost entirely eliminated their use from my code.  Funny thing is though I've never found a use for xForms which are supposed to be "the future" of forms... I just don't see it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been using Flash Forms quite a bit recently to build the configuration and reporting interface for my web-app. It's the first Flash Form I've done and is more of an experiment than anything else. I must say, I have very, very mixed feelings about Flash Forms now.</p><p>Some things were very quick and simple - getting the form set up and looking pretty was cake. Getting data using remoting was easy too, as was getting it on the form, but updating the data was an absolute nightmare. As an example, if you populate a dataProvider from a query returned using remoting and then manually add another item to the same dataProvider, it updates the screen but dataProvider.length doesn't increment. You have to take a copy of the contents, add your item to the copy, then re-set the dataProvider using the copy.</p><p>That's just one little example of the several little problems that wasted days of time figuring out what was happening and trying to fix it. Others include changing a date formats being a pain, and file upload/download not being possible unless you use a seperate SWF built in Flash.</p><p>Now that I know about them the next app I develop won't take as long. However, I still think I could get the same functionality built in half the time using DHTML. It just wouldn't look anywhere near as pretty as a Flash Form ;)</p></div>

My most recent project was a dashboard application for an enterpise level productivity and quality results.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally I find the problem with form data retention a pain in the a$$. Such as using a back button on a verification page to allow the user to go back and edit what they have already entered on the main form. Setting the timeout property doesnt work properly and the user has to start the entry process over again. Coding for this problem exceeds the compile limit quickly on a complex form. Bollocks!</p></div>
