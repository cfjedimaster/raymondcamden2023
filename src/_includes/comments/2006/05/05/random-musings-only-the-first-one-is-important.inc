		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hear ya Ray.  I am a big guy (6'3", 257 lbs until recently), and I went on a DDR Kick (for those who dont know, DDR = Dance Dance Revolution, very fun game and great way to get in shape)  I was feeling the 'programmers spread' for sure.</p><p>We had a competition at work for weight loss on teams, and over 8 weeks I lost a total of 40 lbs doing DDR 1/2 hour a day (or more lately as the addiction has built up) and eating better.  Best thing I have done is stopped drinking pop, and I feel so much better. DDR is such an awesome workout too, especially at higher difficulties. Not trying to brow-beat you into anything, just offering what worked and continues to work for me!</p><p>And for anyone in the DDR 'know', I managed to pull an A on heavy mode Holic the other day, I was very geeked =)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I will totally "second" the DDR recommendation. My son does this at school - and we just had to get one at home. It's a great family activity and there is even a "calorie counting" mode.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's hard to excersize on a routine basis, especially when you work from home (and there is very little incentive to leave the house).</p><p> I have found that buying an mp3 player and downloading a bunch of Podcasts is is good inspiration to go for a walk each day.  I'm currently plowing through the ColdFusion podcast, and am enjoying them.</p><p> Just food for thought.</p></div>
