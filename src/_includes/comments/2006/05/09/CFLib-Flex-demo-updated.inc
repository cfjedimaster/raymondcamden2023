		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am still siding with AJAX for general purpose applications. Our local power company, and Whirlpool (to my knowledge) don't allow plugins. (Guess that rules out flash/Flex doesn't it.) Using prototype you can do some pretty amazing things.</p><p>On the other hand there are times that the concept of Flex is great. Slow startup on Flash Forms is the primary complaint. My second no on Flash Forms is the limited feature set. The more my customers like it the more they will request for it to do. That is when you run into trouble. You either have to get them to fund Flex, a rewrite in AJAX... or make them happier by saying the way you built it means that it will cost to much to add the feature they want/need!</p><p>I am learning some Flex but admit that reservations are part of my evaluation also.</p></div>

It is - by FAR - the single most common complaint.</p><p>The functionality is great, the look &amp; feel is great, everything - BUT the load time - is great.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't forget that Flash Forms are based on Flex 1.5 and not Flex 2. Flex 2 startup apps are lot faster than previous version of Flex. <br>With the RDS plugin &amp; CFC generator and the future Application Generation wizard (Damon Cooper's blog), it would be very easy to deploy Flex 2 applications for CF.</p></div>
