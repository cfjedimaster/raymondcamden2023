		<div class="comment_text"><p>What exactly is the appeal in Flex?  I don't understand.  If it requires a plugin on my browser, I really have no interest.  I don't care for Flash or anything else that can't be viewed on certain OS's or environments.  Is Flex something different entirely?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jeff, you don't care for Flash? Why not? Saying that it can't be viewed in 100% of all platforms/browsers seems a bit extreme. Last time I checked, I believe Flash penetration was around 98%. That certainly seems good enough for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Flash and it's 98%. That was built in the dark days before everyone worried about security. It used to be if you visited a web site that had a Flash (skip-intro) movie, that Flash would be installed with very little user involvement. Those days are gone or they should be gone.</p><p>With all of the new advancements of Flash will it still be an easy install and will it be safe? Version 9 is an Active X object for IE and a plug-in for FF. Either way this is another open door to the user's computer. I doubt anyone wants Adobe to be another un-secure Microsoft. Many of us have fought with Adobe Acrobat Reader and it installing other software. It is my understanding that Adobe has said it will bundle Flash with Acrobat Reader. I do not view this as a good thing. All of these things do not lend themselves to maintaining that 98%. As I see it, Adobe's hope will be the already in-place use of Flash. In other words if the user wants the content of a Flash page, the user will have to pay the price. This gives a new meaning to the term 'Rich Internet Experience'.</p><p>Take a look at Adobe's Spry JavaScript libraries (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flabs.adobe.com%2Ftechnologies%2Fspry%2F%29%3A_rM0oPsGDinh0HJdhVPVURrZGBA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/)">http://labs.adobe.com/techn...</a>. This would seem to have much more potential than Flash. There is no install, or additional doors to the user's computer. Worst case scenario is the user has to turn on JavaScript, which now is on by default.</p><p>What is Adobe doing to maintain Flash's ease of use and making it safe? And/Or will Adobe make Flex work more with JavaScript?</p></div>
