We have been playing the Lego games (which they love) and now want to watch all the movies (but they won't see episode 3 for a while) and a lot of Star Wars toys (they currently have more lightsabers than I ever had).  I love watching them enjoy the movies and do a lot of the same pretend play I did as a kid.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I received the gift of laughter and joy.  My whole nuclear family was there.  I had the pleasure of my mother and father, siter and her husband, my loving girlfriend and my adorable dog.</p><p>I received some very humerous gifts like a "Hooters" golf bag that will make the guys laugh on the range.  I bought myself and girlfriend some nice lap desks for the bedroom, since we both enjoy computing in comfort.  I received a weed wacker to help me with my lawn as I am a recent first time home owner.  My parents always enjoy me looking sharp, so they bought me a few dress shirts and pants for work. (Father probably chose them as he has great taste in professional clothes)  My girlfriend bought me a MMORPG to give my active mind something to wrap around to stop me from coding so much.</p><p>So, I would say that wholistically that I was taken care of.  The family was the most important as the stress of the girlfriend spending the first holidays with me was there.  It all turned out very nicely.</p><p>I wish everyone a beautiful new year, good fortune and love.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Teddy</p></div>
