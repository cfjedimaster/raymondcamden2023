		<div class="comment_text"><p>"...IE also changed how they handle what they consider to be automatic file downloads. If a page tries to download a file and you had not linked directly to the file, you will get a warning. If you tell IE to accept the download then it reloads the page."</p><p>Holy cow - so _THATS_ what happened!!!</p><p>This has been driving (my users) nuts!  What a joke - why do they continue to ruin the browsing experience?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The answer to that Todd has to be because they can. :)</p><p>No Really, they are trying to fix problems that we asked them to.  We wanted less spyware and viruses.  We didnt want to let IE automatically download content to our computers.  Its just tough that they way the application is set up, destroying the users experience is the only way to do that.</p><p>Its harder on us developers, but in general its better for folks.</p><p>Yuck. I just defended Microsoft.  My mac book pro is probably going to shock my fingers now :)</p></div>
