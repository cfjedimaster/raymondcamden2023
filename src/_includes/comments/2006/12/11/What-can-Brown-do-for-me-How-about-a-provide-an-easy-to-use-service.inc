		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm currently working on using the UPS api with cf, it definitely is a huge hassle to get started. I've used fedex's api before, and its a lot easier to get going with them. If you ever get all your keys and codes, let us know what you come up with.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Like you stated, it is really amazing to me that this process has been so hard &amp; why they do not have a developer account like most companies. Imagine If Adobe said we released some new features in CF8, try to figure out what they are!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Fantastic coincidence that you should blog about this Ray, as with Scott, I've just started to venture into expanding my shopping cart app to deal with the UPS Api, and its proving to be more work than nececary.</p><p>Even once the little monsters give you all the details you need, that only gives you access to certain services, and you have to apply for further keys for any additional services, amazing.</p><p>Then, once you're up and running you have to start looking into how thier services work, its all XML based, so you have to pass XML into thier service and it'll post back your details, what a mess ... we really should clean up brown with some nice SOAP, it'd be a much cleaner method :-)</p><p>Rob</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My goodness!  It's glad to know I'm not stupid (well, not because of this anyway).  UPS is the ONE company where I've ever had to converse with tech support to use a website.  I don't know how long it took me to find the instructions on the API.  I mean, just some simple documentation!</p></div>
