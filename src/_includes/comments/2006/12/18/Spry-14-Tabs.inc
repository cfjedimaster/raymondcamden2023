		<div class="comment_text"><p>Odd. I see it changing. I have width set to 100% though so it should stay the same. Maybe someone smarter than me will see the issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>my only qualm with the tabbed implementation is size. Anywhere I could realistically use it at the moment the data in those tabs would be large enough that I would question the validity of doing that load in if theres a chance the user wouldn't switch to one of the tabs that just ate up that processing power.</p><p>I could be wrong but given the class designation I don't think it would be easy to tie in the new updatecontent or innerhtml to the current tabbed panels release in 1.4 to load onclick without making much of it homebrewed. Am I wrong?</p></div>
