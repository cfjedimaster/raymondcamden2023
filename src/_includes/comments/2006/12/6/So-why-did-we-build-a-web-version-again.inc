		<div class="comment_text"><p>Quickbooks software version is the same way.  I have Quickbooks Pro 2005, and much to my shock, after upgrading to IE7 Quickbooks threw a nice little not compatiable with IE7 message.  It's remedies for the problem were downgrading back to IE6 or dropping some coin and upgrading to Quickbooks Pro 2007.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, love your blog!  For what it's worth I'm building something in  Cold Fusion called BudgetSnap (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.budgetsnap.com%3AZnzCrjyFuC-U5OEPHqS0zUuRF2M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.budgetsnap.com">http://www.budgetsnap.com</a>) that I use to manage my finances.  In the next version I plan to integrate the timesheet and invoicing system I use to manage my consulting business.  There is a shared access feature that should make things quite interesting for small companies.  Anyway, check it out and let me know if you like the direction I'm going.  Best wishes,  John</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Its one thing for a commercial application to do this sort of thing, although I don't think it is a wise or bright thing.  But it is another thing for federal agencies to do this for their websites (internal or external).  FEMA had this issue during the Katrina crisis on the site they let you report your issues to.  And other federal agencies do the same.  Welcome to a battle I fight frequently!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been looking into this a LOT lately, for biz as well as clients. I use QuickBooks for the biz -- hard not to since it's pretty much the standard. But for timetracking/etc it's lame (even on Windows, the app is a VB3-era MSAccess app).</p><p>So here's the shortlist for web-based options:</p><p>1) Freshbooks. This is just TOO cool. Invoicing, troubletickets, and timetracking on the cheap.<br>2) Basecamp integrated with Tick (timetracking) and Blinksale (invoicing) Or just one of the $50 Basecamp accounts with timetracking and then Blinksale.</p><p>An open source alternative is WRTracker for time and ActiveCollab for basecamp-y stuff.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know one thing do not make the mistake of getting MS Money.  We got whatever their best version is to track business and home expenses/bugdets and it is just flakey in how it works or is for our needs at least.  We had Quicken before and liked it a lot better but got MS Money this time around because it was so much less money after rebates, guess you get what you pay for.</p><p>Anyone know of any good time tracking tools that will work on a PDA and can be sync'd to something on a PC or even online?  I have been using something made by a company called Twin Peaks but they long since quit making the program and supporting it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use Quickbooks 2007 for OS X, and it's so-so.  My formal education is in business management, so I get the chart of accounts, balance sheets, etc., but I now understand why a second industry of "Quickbooks Training," etc., has popped up:  if you just want to run a small company, log expenses, invoices, and payments, and maybe track some employee time, it's nowhere near a "pleasure" to use.</p><p>Hell, I can't even figure out how to write an invoice that invoices the same customer for time worked against multiple work orders - I have to do a seperate invoice for each work order, or just kludge everything into one job and enter WO numbers onto each line item by hand.</p><p>It's funny that you posted this, because I was just debating the merits of hacking together my own Flex-based time entry/invoicing system (not rocket science) and then just entering the invoices into QB by hand.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Have you checked out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FBlinksale.com%3F%3ALvAULA-CjbV9g1TtqwCortyzaGE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Blinksale.com?">Blinksale.com?</a>  It's a cool site that does invoicing (built with Ruby on Rails).  You can send 5 invoices/month for free, I subscribe for $12/month to send 50 invoices/month.  You can set it up to do reoccurring invoices which is sweet.  I use it for my hosting clients.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tof,</p><p> Writing "Quickbooks" is not trivial by any stretch of the imagination.  Writing "The portions of QuickBooks you intend to use" may be a bit easier.</p><p> I think Intuit went to extremes to make the web version (which I've seen but do not use personally) act like the desktop version.  It's a Rich Internet Application.  That's probably why they use the IE6 only disclaimer.  Maybe Adobe can convince them to Flex it, which would address cross-platform issues.</p><p> (I seem to remember it being demonstrated to me in Firefox, but I could be wrong)</p><p>Ray,</p><p> Are you going to get Quicken (Personal Finance software) or Quickbooks (The Business software).  You've used them both in the comments.</p><p> I have the "Professional Services" edition of Quickbooks and am happy enough no to change.  I think I'm on 2005 right now.  I upgrade every 2-3 years.  I also use for my CD / DVD duplication business to help keep track of inventory and the sort.  I have no complaints.</p><p> I keep all my finance stuff on one computer (not a laptop) and it stays in the office.</p><p>Joe,</p><p> I have had some odd problems w/ QuickBooks.  For instance I never could figure out how to roll over an "advance" from one customer job to the next.  I'm sure there is a way.  Yeah, Quickbooks takes a little getting used to.</p></div>
