		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just got a brand new Dell.  After 2 weeks, my DVDs would not play.  I tried using Cineplayer that came with the machine.  I then tried Windows Media Player and got an error about a possible copyright problem.  So I called Dell and they said there was a bug with Codec that both Cineplayer used as well as WMP.  They said a fix should be out in a week.</p><p>They said the temp fix was to roll your system clock back to Nov 1.</p></div>

Try removing the DVD device from device manager, reboot and let windows reinstall it.<br>2. Run DVD Decrypter and point it to the disc in question, that will tell you if there is something on it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Damien. Long ago I had an HP 2x CD writer. Apparently the laser was attached to the drive assembly by plastic clips. Eventually the laser fell out of alignment because the heat of the drive partially melted the clips. It could read but it couldn't write, then, eventually it died completely.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond,</p><p>Believe it or not, the very first comment above, from David, is probably your solution.  Change the date on your PC to November, and your DVD will work fine. It worked on the Dell I have at work, and my home-built PC here at home, both of which run Win XP SP2.  Doesn't matter if I use WMP or a third-party movie player, if the PC's date is December, it won't work.</p><p>Give it a try.</p></div>
