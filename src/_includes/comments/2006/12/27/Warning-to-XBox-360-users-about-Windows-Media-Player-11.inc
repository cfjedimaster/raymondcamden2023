		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anyone got it connected to media center 2005?  I connected to MCE 2006 with ease and am streaming live and recorded tv from my notebook to the xbox like nobody's business (over a wireless network no less).  Added a projector to it and I have a 60" display of the Simpsons. ;-)  I can't find a way to do so with MCE 2005.  I would love to do so if only for the music.  I would guess that it would be the same software as XP Pro sp2, but so far no luck.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't mind experimentation, but Microsoft needs to standardize on a place to find all the features that don't need to be big "CLICK ME!" buttons. Before, you could always search in the main menu bar that was in the same place on every application. Now, neither WMP, IE, Office, or Windows have matching interfaces. It's going to be frustrating for many users moving to Vista. I'll guarantee you that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>WMP11, IE7 and Vista are mostly moving to a menu-less interface but they are still fairly similar. IE7 directly uses Windows Vista's interface, where the menu is hidden and the top row is: back/forward, address, search.</p><p>If you want to use the menu in any of these three, just hit the 'Alt' key and the menu will pop up. WMP11's menu is almost identical to the last 4 versions of WMP ;)</p><p>Office on the other hand does away with the traditional menus completely, but the new ribbon interface is far more intuitive and includes even more features than before. Infact it exposes good features that some people never knew about *because* they were hidden under unintuitive menus, and makes so many other options simply more accessible with just one click. I'm happy to see Microsoft doing a bit of innovation in this area and I think the ribbon interface will be adopted fairly quickly in the Windows world.</p><p>It is a real shame that the transition from Windows Media Connect to WMP11 wasn't easier, but things like this do get missed occassionally. Personally, I use WMP11 for playing media on my PC but I use TVersity for streaming pictures, music and video to my Xbox 360, since TVersity has the added bonus of transcoding video on-the-fly to allow you to watch video that would be otherwise unsupported (such as divx/xvid).</p><p>@Joshua: I used to use my 360 with MCE 2005, but I'm not sure what you mean by MCE 2006 as there is no such product. Vista's "Windows Media Center" is the successor to MCE 2005, which does work beautifully with the Xbox 360. I was totally impressed that the extender can just use a whole new interface form the host with no worries :D If you need the ability to play other video formats with it, there is a recent release of Transcode360 that supports Media Center in Vista.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary,</p><p>I'll walk you through it.  I'm not sure what you're problem is, so i'll start from the begining.</p><p>You already downloaded Tversity so, check that one off.</p><p>With Tverysity, if you're trying to stream Divx/Xvid files you're gonna need FFDShow.   You can get it here:  <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.free-codecs.com%2Fdownload%2FFFDShow.htm%3AioRs1ndoZCeMYSkoEQwROYdyPUo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/FFDShow.htm">http://www.free-codecs.com/...</a></p><p>Make sure you download FFDShow before the next step, because if you do them backwards it can cause some playback issues.</p><p>Now you need some codecs, (without these you will get error messages on the 360 when trying to play your files)  download this codec pack:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.free-codecs.com%2FK_Lite_Codec_Pack_download.htm%3AIMSiCIm85V8ajZciBN0k_QzDEcY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.free-codecs.com/K_Lite_Codec_Pack_download.htm">http://www.free-codecs.com/...</a><br>(i use the 2.83 BASIC pack)  <br>______________________________________________</p><p>Now, if you haven't disabled sharing in WMP you need to do it now.  In WMP11 click "Library", go to "Media Sharing" and disable it..  If you're using WMP10, i think you do it through your Media Connect program.  <br>_______________________________________________</p><p>Open Tversity.  Click the "Advanced" tab, and "Start Sharing".  Hit the big "+" icon and add your file.</p><p>Your 360 should see the file now, though you might have to go to "Computer"(in the purple blade on the 360) and disconnect from your old connection manually.</p><p>When you go to Videos, a Tversity connection should appear.<br>____________________________________________________</p><p>Now, it's all about optimizing your TVersity settings so your video runs as smooth as possible..</p><p>I'll check back....let me know if you need anything else.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Under Settings in TVersity go to the Transcoder panel and scroll to the bottom and uncheck "Decode the media as fast as possible without taking into account its bitrate". Now it should only use as much CPU time as needed rather than the 100% that it would have used otherwise. If you are still having CPU related problems you might need to play with some of the other settings on than panel to see if you can sort it out (perhaps lower the resolution and the quality, and use less compression). Hopefully the first step wil work for you though :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sean,</p><p>Yes, but let me elaborate.</p><p>Tversity doesn't actually start converting your movie file until you hit "PLAY" on your 360. (That's why it takes a minute for your movies to start)  If you have a high resolution setting and high res. video it's gonna take longer to convert and you're probably gonna get the freezing issues.</p><p>A lot of people deal with this by starting their videos before they actually want to watch them and pausing or stopping the video.  (Even if you stop the video, it's still transcoding on your PC as long as TVersity is still running/sharing) This way it gives the transcoding a "head start" so you don't get the freezing issues.  But be aware that if you still have the high res. setting its gonna take longer to transcode and you may actually catch up to your conversion point.</p><p>Try setting your Max Video resolution to something lower.  (Go to Settings/Transcoder.)  I have mine set really low at "480 x 360"  I don't really notice too much of a difference in the quality, or at least not enough that i care.  You might be able to get away with a bit of a higher setting depending on your PC.</p><p>I still start my videos 10-15 mins before i watch them, and i don't really get freezing issues too often, but when i do..i just pause for 5 mins and i'm right back to streaming video.</p><p>Hope this helped.</p><p>If you're interested i can tell you how you can save the transcoded .WMV version of your AVI/Divx files so that you don't have to convert a second time if it's something you will be watching again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Go to the media blade and try to connect to your pc, when it gives you the<br>message that it could not find a pc select the connect ot another pc tab. The<br>360 should look for any available pc's. For some reason whe you download WMP<br>11 it changes the display name for your computer so the only way I was able<br>to get the 360 to see my pc was to use the connect to another pc tab and it<br>connected right to my pc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi there. I've been working on this for the last week and have been having mixed success with it. I have tried MCE, TVersity, WMP11 amongst other things and have been struggling to get this all working.</p><p>I have removed all the software/crap installed in the process of geting this working and have only WMP11 remaining. I have set up the media sharing in this and i can successfully connect, browse and play/view all my mp3s and pictures. Great!</p><p>What i am still having difficulties with is videos. I have various movies and tv shows on my PC that i want to watch. Although i can see the folder on the PC through my xbox, whenever i check on of the folders i just get a message telling me "no video files were found" or something similar. The video files are definitely on the PC in the folders, and play in WMP11 on the PC without any issues.</p><p>Can anyone please help with this? Am i missing something or have i done something wrong?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you want to connect your XBOX 360 to a wireless connection and don't feel like paying $100.00 for the adapter, all you have to do is run an Ethernet cable from your XBOX 360 to your  laptop/PC that is connected wirelessly.  Then go to control pannel and click on network setting, then click on LAN and click properties go to the advanced tab and select, "Allow other computers to connect through this computer."  It worked for me and I've been using it since.</p></div>
