		<div class="comment_text"><p>Who says Dreamweaver is inadequate? It's just different. Personally, I have never cared much for Dreamweaver. I don't think I match it's target audience. Eclipse is much more a "coders" IDE then DWMX, in my hot-so-humble opinion.</p><p>Critter made some points about price, and I agree for sure, but at the end of the day, I don't think it's "DW sucks, Eclipse rocks", but more that one IDE is suited for some types of people than another IDE.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>I left a comment on Mark Drew's website as well.  The initial instructions from the Adobe labs seems incomplete.  The CFEclipse update sections instructs users to get the latest stable build of 1.2.  The instructions that follow after that assume that the RDS plugin is apart of the 1.2 CFE version.</p><p>Am I missing an option here?  Adobe refers to Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; RDS Connections, which after the update is not present.</p><p>What's up?!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just figured out something that may help some people.  I have a dev server with multiple instances and I couldn't get RDS to work.  So I tried something different, I found out what port the coldfusion instance was on (i.e. 8302) and changed the port in RDS from 80 to 8302 and BAM! It works.  Maybe multiple instances have to have the instance port number.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bill, it doesn't work that way. You can't use RDS to push the files up. You just use RDS to edit the remote files. You can _make_ new files and folders, but you can't move them from your local machine to the RDS server.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I ran into an issue where flex cf RDS was not connecting to my cf production webserver but it would connect to my cf dev server. I noticed that my dev server still had the default website that IIS creates. I had deleted the default IIS site on the production server a few months ago. After creating a default site mapped to c:\inetpub\wwwroot RDS began working. Does anyone know why RDS needs to have a site pointing to the default IIS site?</p></div>
