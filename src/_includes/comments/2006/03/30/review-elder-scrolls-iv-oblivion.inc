		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you should have gone with the PC version.  I've been playing The Elder Scrolls games since Daggerfall (but I did buy Arena after beating Daggerfall) and the PC, to me, is the only way to go.  Add in the fact that you can download and install plugins for the PC version and it's a no brainer.  I think the text issue is better on the PC also.  I haven't noticed any problems at least.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Joshua, I still haven't found any factions or guilds. I found the mage guild south of the big city, but I couldn't do anything with it. I figure I'll look more later as I move up. To be honest, I'm not talking to -every- single person or visiting -every- single house cuz if i do, I'll never finish. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>hahahaa.  I know, I wish I started with the mages guild earlier.  I have joined fighters, but haven't really done anything with them yet.  You can join multiple guilds, and you should at least join mages guild for reasons below.</p><p>1) Join the mages guild.  Once you do your basic qualification quests you can enchant items and make your own spells.  Plus it is a good way to visit every city and learn stuff.  Visit any city and find their mages guild.  Every city has one.  You can join by talking to someone in there, then get tasks from each one.</p><p>spoilers (very minor).  dont' read unless you want to know how to do the thieves guild etc.</p><p>2) The Theives guild is handy if you need to find a place to sell your stolen stuff, or have a bounty on your head and want to pay it off.  Just talk to a begger, and get his disposition of you pretty high.  70 maybe?  Bribing is easy way, but you can also do that little mini game, or cast charm type spells on them.  Then ask about grey fox.  He should tell you how to join and start the quest for it.</p><p>3) in the major city is a merchant area.  There is a quest from Jenna or someone like that to deal with a merchant that is undercutting in prices.  Do that whole quest string and eventually one of the merchants will like you a lot.  you can then sell your stuff for much more money with them.</p><p>4) don't forget to haggle.  Even a little haggleing will help raise your skill.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>the faces are puffy because of the camera's (your primary view) field of view, it's "wide" so you can see more around you - which from a photography standpoint causes noticable distortion on faces.  if the view had a 'longer' lens, the people wouldn't seem so distorted, but you wouldn't be able to see as much around.... google around for field of view and photography for more info on the principle.</p></div>
