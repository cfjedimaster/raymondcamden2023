		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, seriously. ;-)  I already have a database with some of my yarn info entered (for instance, manufacturer, brand, color, how many balls of yarn i have, etc), along with tables for entering information about a person's measurements, publications, pattern, etc.  There are several online calculators where you can create a pattern based on a person's measurements.  I guess one could even come up with a way to get suggested yarns based on the yardage required for a pattern.  Basically, anything you want . . . the hard part is coming up with a way to do this easily in ColdFusion with so may ways to skin a cat.  Gotta run now . . . i'll give you links to such online calculators so you can see what I'm talking about.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lola, I'd be very interested in seeing these calculators as well. Not for my self, but for the credits I'd get from my wife showing her these ;)</p><p>Seriosly - my wife is a professional clothes constructor (I thinkt that would be the correct title in english), but she's just getting started in making use of computers to aid her work. So any tools that she could use, or gain ideas from, would be highly appreciated.</p></div>
