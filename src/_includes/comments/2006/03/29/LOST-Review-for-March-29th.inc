		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, why do you think it was another castaway who drew the map? A castaway sneaking around the Dharma facilities would have drawn the map on a sheet of paper that they could have taken with them.</p><p>Since Desmond was in a Dharma uniform and referred to a string of replacements that went before him (although I remember that he was a "castaway" himself), I'm presuming that the survivors are the first set of non-Dharma occupants of the hatch.  Besides, with Dharma participants in the hatch pressing the button through the time that Desmond arrived, when would any castaway have had the chance to draw that map with the blast doors down?</p><p>It seems a simpler explanation to me that the map represents the notes of one of the Dharma scientists, or at least a Dharma participant. Only they would likely have the knowledge of all of the hatch locations, could have gotten the blast doors down reliably, and would have drawn the map on the blast door. Or are you presuming that one or more castaways had extended, private access to the hatch in the past?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stroz, why do those writings convince you they were written by non-Dharma folks? Would it be any more likely that castaways would write in Latin? The case could be made that scientists would all know some Latin.</p><p>I do have to admit that Dharma participants would not be as secretive about their notes, though. But what if they themselves are hiding their notes from the "He" that has been mentioned?</p><p>I know it sounds as if I'm convinced that the map was written by Dharma folks, but I'm only leaning that way. I just haven't heard a good theory about how castaways would have had the time and opportunity to draw it instead.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>After seeing the drawing again and seeing the translations I think someone was stuck in there for a while. They were in there when the countdown finished and were stuck so they had plenty of time to make the drawing. The last translation by Scott was "The wrath of the gods may be great, but it certainly is slow" which makes me think that nothing happened when the countdown finish but the doors closing. Not sure why they closed early this time but there seemed to be some power issuse so maybe it was related to that--or maybe they always close for a supply drop? Great episode</p></div>

So much for a) avoiding things you dislike b) paying royalties</p><p>Well, if the crap ones would say on the cover that they're crap then I could know beforehand and not buy them :-) And no, didn't use American money.</p><p>Come live in Vietnam, then report back to everyone about your great pride in buying "real" dvds. First you'd have to find one in the entire country. Or you could try Amazon, but they'll cancel your order if forwarding to Vietnam. If sent, you get to wait and deal with VN Customs. That's real fun. Or you can just buy it in the market for $1. The great thing is there are many international films that you would never end up seeing in the US, so that's good. And of course the usual Hollywood junk if you're in a McDonalds-like mood.</p><p>(Coldfusion and everything else costs $1 as well, by the way. It's a bit like itunes pricing. And the reality is there would be almost zero royalties if unavailable, because almost no one could buy at the regular price.)</p><p>Still, Lost is an amazingly dumb show written by/for people all hopped up on sugar and french fries. I was just wondering if there is anything good on in the US these days. A drama with a believable plot, actual characters, etc.</p></div>
