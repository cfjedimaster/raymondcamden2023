		<div class="comment_text"><p>Brian,</p><p>Remember that you can set the timeouts for your session and application scope within the application.cfc. So during your testing, try setting the timeouts to 1 minutes, this way you won't have to wait a year to see if your code works or not. Plus add some code in the methods to dump all the scopes to a file, this way you can see exactly whats going on when the methods fire.</p><p>Just my two cents (I'll accept change)</p></div>
