		<div class="comment_text"><p>The thing with shared hosting is that you really do get what you paid for.  If you are deploying super-secret source code that has real value to you, don't go with shared hosting.  If you have mission-critical data worth a lot to you, don't go with shared hosting.  If you need 5 nines of up-time, don't go with shared hosting.  I say this as someone who uses a couple different shared hosts and have done so (mostly) happily for years.  I've been happy with SmarterLinux (which just merged back into its parent HostMySite), and I've heard lots of good things about CrystalTech over the years.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another option you could consider when deploying your source code to a shared hosting environment is compiling to byte code when you deploy to the host (provided they are running ColdFusion 7).  I don't believe this can be reverse engineered back to source code as easily, if it can be decompiled at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've used Crystaltech shared and dedicated hosting for five years and they have been stellar. I've tried a number of other hosts during that time (with various customers), and I've found no one to match Crystaltech's response time for phone (always answer with little or no hold time), email (less than 1/2 hour), and forum support. When I signed up I was customer number 49xx and they now have around 75xxx customers. Believe it or not, their service has actually gotten better rather than worse as they've grown, their hosting plan features have expanded on a regular basis, and their prices have gradually gone from low to lower as they've passed on their economies of scale to their customers. It's rare that I am so positive about a vendor, but these guys have been pretty impressive. (They also have a good reseller program that allows you to private label their services.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think one of the biggest things you have to look for is their level of tag support.  GoDaddy for example says they dont support the createObject method or cfobject tag.  Imagine trying to run this blog without that.  I think instead of trying to figure out how to secure something many cf hosts just say screw it, we just won't give it to them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have used CrystalTech for about five years and have about 20 sites there now. I find them first-rate. You get plenty of warning about anything that might change, and the resopnse time on all issues is really quick. There are also several CFX_ components already installed for image resizing, etc.</p><p>One tip about working in a shared hosting environment that addresses a comment made eariler -- you should make sure your tags have names that are going to be unique. For instance, instead of a custom tag named "wrapper" you would name the tag "curtisdotcomwrapper" etc., so there is no chance of the mapping going awry.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One thing to keep in mind on shared servers is the fact that there is a fundemental flaw in most CF setups on shared hosting, thus being the shared scopes of sessions and application variables. Since CF will allow multiple applications to have the same exact name. If you are on a shared server you need to know this element of weakness even when in a sandbox account. There is always an element of security weakness on shared boxes unless the host has setup a virtual partitions shown in SW-Soft's virtuoso and then have a multi-instanced CF setup with sandboxes. Most shared hosts will not do this and you just have to keep this in mind. Do not store sensitive details in session or applications variables which another user on the system could have the same exact application name as yours!</p></div>

We really can't say enough about them. Though there have been some Coldfusion issues that have come up, probably because of user-abuse on the shared server, I must say that their tech support has gone beyond the call of duty to work with us to make it work.<br>Recently, we setup a Coldfusion site on GoDaddy, because client was firm about not being willing to pay annual fees over $100 for hosting... okay...<br>So right now Coldfusion won't run on the site but tech support says they are fixing it. Atleast they do have people who answer the phone and so far they have really taken care of any issues we've brought up. Hopefully this one will work out. It's really kind of too bad that some of these super-low priced hosting plans are so widely publicized to every Tom, Dick and Harry who knows how to read a magazine because now everyone is asking for $3.99/month web-hosting!<br>I will say that GoDaddy has been great for some of our non-coldfusion accounts... no problems at all and their up-time seems to be stellar.</p></div>
