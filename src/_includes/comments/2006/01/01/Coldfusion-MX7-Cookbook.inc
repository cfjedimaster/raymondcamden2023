		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have actually been looking for a CFMX7 Cookbook. I like seeing snippets of code not only to solve certain problems but also to spark ideas and my imagination. Or even a Coldfusion Hacks type of thing like the OReilly books offer. So in answer, my vote is yes. A series of contests or posts is a great idea. I know I would actively participate!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I have several chapters from the "ColdFusion Cookbook" Jeremy Petersen and I started writing a few years back for O'Reilly.  The book was killed off part way through, though, and never made it to print.  If you're familiar with the O'Reilly Cookbook format, it's problem/solution oriented.  I don't remember which chapters specifically we completed, but I'll take a look tomorrow, and contact O'Reilly and see if they have any issues with donating them to the community.  They aren't CFMX 7 specific, but many of the "recipes" are still relevant.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Instant ColdFusion (My first book) was a "ColdFusion Cookbook", but utlimately failed as a commercial endeavor.  There were various reasons for this, one of the biggest being the the profileration of CF books around that time.</p><p> The book was also pre-CFC, so my impulse is to say that all most of the content would no be irrelevant.  The book did drop off my last two royalty statements, which probably means its one step closer to reverting back to my hands</p><p> I'd love to re-work it to something more useful in today's CFMX world.</p><p> I think the CF cookbook market is small niche inside a small market, so I wouldn't expect a publisher to be interested, but I can see the real benefit of releasing something of the kind in a digital format.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So later today I plan on buying <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoldfusioncookbook.com%3ABj3gX0l4i-yY7eZceaDBxIHiq44&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="coldfusioncookbook.com">coldfusioncookbook.com</a> (if anyone here beats me to it, I'm going to kick your butt, as my five year old likes to say). Question - does it make sense to use the blog as the 'platform' for the content? It does make it easier for me. However, a second app, a fully different site, may make the site more easy to find and use. That means a bit more work for me though. A new app would also make it easier to correctly share content. So for example, Rob said he wanted to share. I could write a blog post and say, "Rob did this", but I'm not sure it really works well.</p><p>So I guess the question is - Do it here (quicker to start, but merged with the rest of my content) or do it as a new site (slower to start).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, excellent ideas you have there.  I say start off small with the 'platform' content, then slowly build to the 'share' content.  Continue with what you have now because before long you might get swamped with user requests, programming and time issues.  Don't burn yourself out.</p></div>

I think the new seperate site is better for the reasons you listed, but I also think that it will make it less personal, providing possible revenue stream through select sponsors being included on the site.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In addition to doing the eBook PDF thing, you may also want to consider going with a print-on-demand service such as <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flulu.com%3A1KuXQ1jEuapflqSFaML3CwyseQA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="lulu.com">lulu.com</a> to make the final book available to the masses.  It's as simple as: upload a PDF, choose some cover art, done!  It's also completely free to you, the author, and has generally good prices for the reader.  The books are of very good quality (I have several from lulu on my shelves), and the beauty is that you don't have to worry about locking down *one* version.  Every few months you can upload a new PDF and anyone who orders the book after that just magically gets the new version.  (And if you choose to sell the book at cost or make a few bucks per copy, that's entirely up to you.)</p><p>I know this may offend some of the technolustier readers, but many people still do prefer to read from paper instead of a screen.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not very familiar with easycfm. It seems as if easycfm is a collection of articles. That is not exactly what I have in mind for the cookbook. The cookbook is very process orientied. How do I do X? While I'm sure some content will be repeated, I say - the more the merrier. :) Btw - any reason why you didn't post your name? Even if you think my idea is horrible, it's not like I'm going to ban you or anything. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Consistency.  I've always been noname when I post to blogs.  You can can find me on Ben's and others.  That's my Internet alias if you will :-)  My first comment was as noname, so I kept it going.</p><p>One of these years we'll meet at a conference and I'll introduce myself as _____ (aka noname)  ;-)</p><p>Plus, I don't have a blog with my own musings, so my name is really irrelevant.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Please include as much OO/cfscript as possible.  I have found a huge void in these areas in CF reference material.  As a previous poster mentioned, I'm not looking for syntax, I'm looking for ways to produce efficient, compact, tight code.  I feel that with the OO CF stuff I am doing I am making mistakes that many others have probably already made and/or know how to avoid.  Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John - this is where I disagree. I want the cookbook to focus on problems. "OO" isn't a problem per se. I agree that learning OO is not always easy, but I really want the cookbook to focus on problems that can be solved. Very concrete - atomic type problems.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, I'm not asking you to change the format of the book/site.  I agree, OO isn't a problem, but in many cases using OO architecture presents the best solution.  Perhaps you could use OO and/or CF Script code examples as the solutions to some of the problems presented.  I think it would be doing a great service to CF developers (at least the ones I work with, including myself!)  I'm sure I will bookmark the site either way!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John,</p><p>There's a bit of a debate as to whether using cfscript really adds any value.  Although some may consider it to look "cleaner" than tag based code, the counter arguement is that we're all so familiar with html/xhtml/xml, that doing cf all tag based is just "natural" from there.</p><p>Using tags over script also has the added benefit of making it much easier to do code gen from tools.  Parsing out both tags and script is prohibitive in a lot of cases.  Add to that the relative limitations of cfscript, and the fact that  Macromedia (Adobe) in the past has stated they won't be doing anything new in cfscript, and I think you'll have a stronger arguement in favor of using tags over script.</p><p>That said, I don't believe Ray's made any mention either way on whether code samples are preferred in tag vs. script format.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray</p><p>Interesting idea.  A comment about comments - I think they will need to be moderated.  By this I mean that if there are two comments to an article, and they are both valid, different to each other, and different to the content of the article itself, they should be promoted to be articles themselves.  Otherwise, the CF beginner could get confused about 'who is right' - 'Why are there 3 ways on the one page to do the one thing??'</p><p>Also, if a comment makes a 'correction' to an article, this should be either fixed in the artice itself, or the article should say 'See the third comment for more information'.</p><p>I'm not sure that a blog is the best way to go - perhaps something more like a forum?  A well-organised forum with a clear heirarchy of content can make things easier to find than the standard blog format - especially with sub-categories.</p><p>PS - Do you actually do any paid work??</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Antony - yes good points. In my blog, I typically let "fixes" stay in the comments. For the cfcookbook, they will be incorporated. As for the issue of confusing a newbie - I will try my best to make it clear that the comments are just that - comments. Thats why I plan on having a download option that doesnt show the comments, and that will be the default.</p></div>
