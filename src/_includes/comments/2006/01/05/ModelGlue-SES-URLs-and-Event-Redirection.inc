		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Thanks for publishing your cookbook code. It really helps those of us that are trying to forge our way into the MG world. I was looking through your cookbook code to see how you implemented the SES rewriting, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I'm sure I'm just looking right over it (my wife says I do it often), so could you point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks,<br>Mark</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well I guess that would explain why I didn't see it. I was looking for something like what you put in the blogcfc, hence my confusion. Now I can tell my wife that I didn't miss it because it wasn't there! :-)</p><p>Thanks.</p></div>
