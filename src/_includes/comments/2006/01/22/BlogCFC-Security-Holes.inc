Rather, these kinds of remarks are just intended stir up trouble.  My advice is to simply ignore it.</p><p>Best,<br>Chris</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, as you see, I responded to his TECHNICAL things mainly, and blew off the paranoid/personal attacks. My concern is with my users (blogcfc users). I want them to feel safe. I'm not too concerned about defending myself. The funny thing is - I have not once attacked him. Ever. Others did and he blames me for that since apparently I have cronies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray thanks for the update, but I think it would have gone without saying that no one thinks you have malicious plans. Personally I can't believe that idiot is still harping about this, all he is doing is digging himself deeper into the hole of being a laughing stock for the entire community. I should take a moment to praise you for your calm responses and even-headedness, because most other people (myself included) would probably have gone ballistic over the absurdity and childness of his actions and statements. Cheers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This really jumped out at me: "(5). This IS the problem with Open Source Code - it is far too wasy for the Author to quietly code-in backdoors and spoofing channels others can use to gain access to whatever they wish."<br>Uh, no. One of the things that makes open source great is the ablity to examine the code for backdoors and security issues before deploying it. It's closed-source code that seems to have all the security problems lately. Security through obscurity is a very failed strategy. The number of successful hacking attacks/worms on Apache, the worlds most widely used web server, approaches zero.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice work Ray! I'm surprised it took so long for such an intelligent programmer as Captain Horn to figure out your evil plans! I met with Joe and Paul this evening, and we will all be doing some more work to obfuscate our evil remote methods, as we have a standardized api worked out. Soon ModelGlue, Tartan, Fusebox, ColdSpring, Reactor and Transfer will also contain the malicious world domination code we all planed on from the start! Soon the internet will be dragged to it's knees as the evil open source coldfusion movement finally unleashes the crippling ultra-destructive combined FrameWork of DOOM!! on the unsuspecting masses!</p><p>(BTW, I hope that posting that here doesn't ruin our plans...)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, to be honest I don't even think you need to respond to this guy's technical assault on your code.  I'm fairly certain that any rational person that reads your blog (and his, of course) will realize he's off the deep end.  His arguments make no sense, his writing style wears me out, he's obviously trying to draw you into an immature mud slinging match, and he has an unholy love affair with JavaScript.  In short, the dude is a few french fries short of a happy meal.</p><p>I don't know how I'd react in your position, but it would probably sound like this:  "Tony, sic your ninja monkey bots on that mo-fo!"  I give you props for having more restraint than I do.</p></div>

I'd uess 95% of the people using it that don't know CF are probably still tech-savvy and would doubt someone would put a security 'hole' the size that 'the other' claims in a blog.  the other 5% probably would ignor him (and the hole) totally.</p><p>Oh, and Seth?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mista Horn wa hen na baka da!!  If chucklehead from the BMW (Bitchers Moaners Whiners) club can't handle a little bit of ethicality in his work then maybe he should go back to the drawing board and create the next killer CF-Blog himself instead of bitching or ad homineming.  Hell, his writing style is so painful to read that I often think he comes across as an uneducated pea-brain who has a hard time double-checking what he types because he can't keep a straight thought and put it to word.  Besides all that, since the Real Ray (Camden of course) has made BlogCFC open source El Raycito Falso can go right ahead and try to make it better because he can see the code gracias to El Real Ray.  I know of someone else who has a good CF blog for sale and he has java-bited the code so you can't peak under the hood (damn the learning luck!).  So, I applaud the Real Ray for keeping it REAL and allowing us to be able to see coding practices and learn from them.  Thank you Real Ray.  However, I do disagree with you on Bush. But hey, we can agree to disagree agreeably on different topics outside of CF.  CF Rocks and YOU, the Real Ray, do too!<br>Con todo respeto y hontou ni kenson ni yoroshiku,<br>Tom</p></div>

I'm sure you did the right thing.</p><p>And even though its amusing to point out the mack-truck sized holes in the arguments of our beloved Ray "Javascript rulez, OSS suxorz" Horn, I think the best thing we as a community can do is ignore the guy and get back to discussing CF.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read this (Ray Camden's) blog infrequently but it stands out in my mind as a good source for CF information and I have a high opinion of Mr. Camden. When I came across this other Ray's website from a link on the CF exchange site (now run by Adobe I guess) I was really surprised to see Camden being attacked. I came here just to see if there was any reply..  Im glad to see there was one post explaining away all of the "security issues" and "bugs" and no long drawn out argument.. Good call taking the high road Mr. Camden- This &lt;I&gt;other&lt;/I&gt; Ray is just a jackass I am now convinced.. Anyone every used his AJAX cusom tag? Im really curious what the hell it might be..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is this the same Ray Horn that ran Hal-Smalltaker years ago? This SOB ran a hosting operation that was a total sham. He took me for hundreds of dollars and then threatened to sue me for asking for a refund because he sold me useless web space that never worked. This was a long time ago but I will never forget it this arrogant piece of crap and the way he tried to belittle me while screwing me out of my money and causing me a serious hardship. If I ever run across him in real life, he's gonna lose some teeth. Dirty Sonofabitch.</p></div>
