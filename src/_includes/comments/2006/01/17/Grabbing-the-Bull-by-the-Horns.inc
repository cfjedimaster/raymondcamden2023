According to the Emedicine Health website, signs and symptoms of rabies include:</p><p>"Animals infected with rabies may appear sick, crazed, or vicious. This is the origin of the phrase "mad dog." However, animals infected with rabies may also appear overly friendly, docile, or confused."</p><p>I love irony!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd just ignore him Ray, he's just pissed someone called him on charging for modifications to an open source application.  You'll just have to start placing a license in your distributions that states if your code is used in any project that it needs to be released as open source or never released to the public.</p><p>I wonder how much of the other projects on his page will end up having open source code he's borrowed, added on to and then wants to sell.  Let's see if he ever actually designs, codes and releases anything that is truly his own work from the ground up and then he can brag on his excellent coding abilities.  I also wonder why he's afraid to turn on comments for his blog... afraid of criticism?</p></div>

I remember Ray making some bug fixes within 10 mins of a blogCFC release specifically to a db issue and so has been the case for incorporating new ideas.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>After reading all the stuff in this fiasco I realize something hard to believe: Ray Horn is not a teenager! He's a middle-aged men (maybe with more than 45 years old) with 30 years in software industry (as he says)... My goodness... During my readings I thought he was one of these crazy boys that we usually see flaming around in mailists and forums. I swear! He looked to me just like a teenager, specially in his argumentation. I startet to feel sorry (as we all do bad things when we're young and arrogant) when I came up with his resume. I just can believe. That's worst than I thought.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finally got around to reading this entry and I was struck with overwhelming disbelief.  I went to the rayhorn website to get a firsthand glimpse at this individuals work.  First thing I realized was that he is using blogCFC.  Although, much like Vanilla Ice, he claims that his code is unique and different there is no doubt that he is violating U.S. copyright law and probably the DCMA.  I found it humerous that an error that was generated on his site reads:</p><p>...\htdocs\rayhorn\blog\org\camden\blog\utils.cfc...</p><p>Hear the difference?</p></div>
