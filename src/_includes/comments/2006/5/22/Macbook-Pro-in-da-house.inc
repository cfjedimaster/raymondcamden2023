Macbook Pro with 2 gig ram and free Apple care, do let me know?</p><p>Thanks<br>Sophek</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congrats!  Since I went through the same transition about a month ago, I'll share with you a few things that I've found when working with Coldfusion on OS X.  Truthfully, I spend about 50% of my time booted into Windows since it's just easier when working with MSSQL.</p><p>1) My "must have" apps:<br>   - Code - Eclipse of course - make sure you set your default JRE to 1.4, though since it won't operate on 1.5 at this time (for JRun and Coldfusion too).  &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skti.org%2FskEdit.php%3Aq6aFzqrGH5sA-P0ISS8Dp77u_xw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.skti.org/skEdit.php">http://www.skti.org/skEdit.php</a>"&gt;skEdit&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good too and allows you to configure individual sites.<br>   - SVN - &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lachoseinteractive.net%2Fen%2Fcommunity%2Fsubversion%2Fsvnx%2Ffeatures%2F%3Aqn-q51YxhRci52dq-XXFOZ5QJQA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/features/">http://www.lachoseinteracti...</a><br>&gt;svnX&lt;/a&gt; which I prefer over the Eclipse plug-in since I'm used to the Tortoise client.<br>   - FTP - &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberduck.ch%2F%3AjzpLx3iHfvEiTxQEaADetieonwE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cyberduck.ch/">http://cyberduck.ch/</a>"&gt;Cyberduck&lt;a/&gt;<br>   - Text Editor misc stuff and for creating Unix Shell scripts - &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmacromates.com%2F%3AdgRq-CzXtYZ4LPxCOOt2tVHYRBo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</a>"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; - skEdit(above) wil also work, but TextMate is better for the Unix stuff.<br>   - Database Client - &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aquafold.com%2Fdownloads.html%3AyOIqqmd9MIqVDQ2jVq3GJnGYWJA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.aquafold.com/downloads.html">http://www.aquafold.com/dow...</a>"&gt;Aqua Data Studio&lt;/a&gt; better in than dbVisualizer, IMHO, which also has some nice features.</p><p>2) Annoyances <br>  - Reactor seems to have some intermittent bugs running on the OS X version of CF.<br>  - Remote Desktop for the mac is very cumbersome, slow, and doesn't allow you to resize the screen.<br>  - The sudden motion sensor on my Macbook Pro is right under the left "Apple" key.  Since I use keyboard shortcuts alot, this means the computer pauses for a second at times as the hard drive protection kicks in.<br>  - Junk mail filtering for Apple Mail is terrible at first and takes forever to "learn" even basic junk filtering.<br>  - Open Office on x11 feels awkward and cumbersome to me - Multiple windows with no direct application shortcuts.  I'll probably invest in Office for Mac once it's Universal Binary.<br>  - I keep using "Apple+D" to delete items which is the duplicate command in OSX. Du'oh!  <br>3) Favorites<br>  - App switching on the Mac is so much better than Windows.  Make sure you become familiar with not only "Apple+Tab", but also "Fn+F9" and "fn+F11".  Awesome.<br>  - Spotlight - App and document searching is sooo much sweeter than dealing with the Start button.<br>Have Fun!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, do you have a whiner?  I was forced to return mine because the high-pitched noise when the processor was idle was too much to take.  It was very obvious when working in a quiet room.  I tried two service trips and one replacement machine and when it did the same I fought for a refund.  A co-worker just got his today with the glossy screen and he has a similar noise.  Did you opt for the glossy screen too?</p><p>Steve</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congrats!  I've had my 17" for almost 2 weeks now.  I've got TextMate, Ruby on Rails, ColdFusion MX7, Parallels (to run a copy of Win 2K so I can play one game), Firefox, ncftp, and PostgreSQL 8.1.3.  Took me a couple hours on Saturday to get ColdFusion running since OS X is now using Java 1.5 by default.  I didn't want to switch back to 1.4.2 for the whole system, so I did a few things to make only ColdFusion use 1.4.2.</p><p>My 17" is super quiet.  I was worried that it might have the problems of the 15" MBP's, but no whine and I haven't heard the fans run at all.  It does get warm, but honestly, when do you actually use it on your lap?  Most of the time I'm at the kitchen table.  If I am in my recliner, I've got a mini desk thingy (thats the technical term) to sit rest on my lap.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd also recommend that you re-install the OS if you are interested in saving some disk space.  OS X, by default, installs all the languages that the system uses.  I mean spoken languages, like English, German, French, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, etc...</p><p>If you reinstall, you can leave out the extra languages.  It will save you about 5 GB's of space.</p></div>

I'm "stuck" with this Dell 200 pound notebook for a few more days (working on a project that needs Windows for a day or so), then I hope to drop this puppy off with my brother in law and never see it again.</p><p>Jeff - you mentioned you use Parellels to play games. I thought Parelles was like other virtual OS things - you could do "normal" stuff, but not games. Am I wrong? (I mean "real" games that use the 3d card, not games like Minesweeper.)</p><p>I've also heard recommendations for the lap things. So far the laptop seems less hot, or not much more hotter, than my XPS, so I guess I'm used to it.</p></div>

Of course, there's always Boot Camp, which I have used to play Halo 2. (Then I installed Parallels and have never used Boot Camp again.) Supposedly, Apple underclocked the graphics chip to keep heat down, and it is possible to increase the clock speed when running Boot Camp - but I wouldn't try it myself.</p><p>I just ordered one of these for working on the couch:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raindesigninc.com%2Filap.html%3AQxlrPWdRqqW64-qcOfZJ45wIA8w&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.raindesigninc.com/ilap.html">http://www.raindesigninc.co...</a><br>My MBP gets hot, and there's a little noise, but it's still the best computer I've ever used.</p><p>Oh yeah, in addition to MacSaber, which you absolutely must have, check out iAlertU, the MacBook car alarm:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slappingturtle.com%2Fhome%2F%3AdZTo3qqobMDBmr3ZcvZOlCerP_0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.slappingturtle.com/home/">http://www.slappingturtle.c...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>One thing to keep in mind if you use your laptop most often just sitting in your lap. While not hot enough to burn, frequently having that much heat in your lap can cause some... medical issues, including sterility. Just having one of those "mini desk thingy's" can save a lot of problems.</p><p>Also, one thing I've experienced with my Mac is frequent WiFi problems. I've been told it has something to do with where the internal antennae is located and the magnesium alloy casing blocks alot of the signal strength. I only get a moderate connection when I'm only 50 feet away.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>The one game I play is Diamond Mind Baseball.  It is far from graphics intensive.  Its really a text based game in windows clothing.  But it runs extremely fast inside of Parallels.  Now I probably wouldn't use Parallels for some of the high graphics games.  For one thing, Parallels doesn't do 3D.  And they substitute their own virtual video card and driver for what you really have.  Very similar to VMware in that regard.</p></div>
