		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, since you're asking for comments.  First thing I found -- search isn't functioning.  But I'm betting that you already know that.  (Or there's no content...didn't think of that.) Glad to see, though, that you're using a homegrown search instead of Google.  Your "old" (read: non-Google) search was much cleaner.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I do not log in correctly I don't get a "You didn't log in correctly, idiot!" message in the log in area. I'd think informing a user that they messed up would be a good thing, but that's me -- your mileage may vary.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When an error occurs when registering a new user with the Email address not in the proper format, the error should be more clear that the error is dealing with the Email Address field.</p><p>"Username must be a valid email address." should read<br>"Please provide a valid email address."</p><p>I say this, because the field is not labeled "Username" but rather "Email Address". Another option would be to change the field name to "Email Address (username)".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Will: Search is working locally, but the index isn't populated remotely. So - it WILL work, but thanks for pointing it out.</p><p>Leif: Agreed. Will add that (tonight though and will post here when done)</p><p>Kyle: Agreed (ditto above)</p></div>
