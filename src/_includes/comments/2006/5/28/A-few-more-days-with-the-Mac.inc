		<div class="comment_text"><p>Isn't it amazing how happy you get when you start using OSX?<br>I bought a intel imac but had some problems and Apple upgraded me to a new MBP a few days ago and I am truely blown away by how the performance of this thing:)</p><p>"Speaking of Eclipse - how can I make my Mac reconnect to my PC drives on startup? How about after my Mac goes to sleep?"<br>Another great thing about OSX is some tools it gives you to make the os do what you want. You should be able to do this with an automator task or applescript.</p><p>Automator is COOL AS SH*T!!<br>For example For the Alix site I made an automator script i leave on my desktop and when do a photoshoot I just take the folder of photos and drop it on the desktop script and it automatically openes up photoshop and sizes, optimizes, watermarks and spits the new images back out into my output folder without me doing a thing. But you can really make it do anything you want.</p><p>FTP - the best one is Transmit, it's really nice how you can put it in your dock and just drop your files into the logo and it uploads for ya!</p><p>Here is another trick I learned today. One thing I didnt like about OSX was no easy way to get to a program that isnt in the dock, there is maxmenus but it doesnt work on intel machines. So today I just dragged the application folder onto my dock and when I right click on it it displays the contents, just what I wanted, I also did this with my webroot and it makes accessing that folder really slick.</p><p>As far as your unhappiness with openoffice, i agree and amazingly I like msoffice for mac but if you need stuff for presentations that are REALLY nice then look at keynote (from apple in iwork) <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiwork%2Fkeynote%2F%3A5T9yVzIlhVpce1D8B8AD3FKosKg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">http://www.apple.com/iwork/...</a> - you should have a demo of this in your applications folder.</p><p>d</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You didn't say whether you were using OpenOffice or NeoOffice/J? I'm assuming the former. Try NeoOffice/J - which has a native "Mac Java" UI with the OpenOffice application underneath and see if you get on better with that.</p><p>Glad you're enjoying your Mac. And I'll second Dave's recommendation for Transmit. I like that it can sit there in the dock and you just drag files to it and it uploads them automatically to the right website!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just switched from a huge Toshiba to a 17" MBP. Size was an important factor for me as well. That keyboard does indeed take time to get used to. Thanks for that warning about pasting folders!</p><p>I've done some testing with Flash using both BootCamp and Parallels this weekend. Using BootCamp you'll probably have a gaming machine better than the Dell. Parallels runs pretty well and just the fact that one can test stuff in XP, Linux, Win98 and more on one single machine is great.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, I've been bitten by that folder behavior too. In fact, I believe that Windows Explorer gives you far more flexibility in certain things than the OS X Finder (one thing I love is how I can do anything in a Save or Save As window (delete files, move things around, etc.) Of course, this can also be confusing for newbies, I'm sure, but I enjoy the flexibility.</p><p>That said, you're right: The random slowdowns, etc. are getting to me to (the Open with... example is a good one.) However, even though I've thought many a time about jumping ship, I'm sure it's just a symptom of the "grass is greener on the other side" ailment. I'm sure there will be things in OS X that slow me down too. At the end of the day, I'm happy with Windows. I've tamed the beast with my array of tools and utilities and I've just got my heart set on the new super-light Vaios that are about to be released :)</p></div>

Everything else about it is so perfect, yet it has one of the worst keyboards on any current laptop. :-P It will be nice when a few more native or universal apps are released.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Why is it that the maximize operation doesn't maximize?"</p><p>Yeah, that is kind of odd when you first try it. What it's doing is the max the app needs. So for example in safari if you are looking at a page that has a max width of 500px when you hit the max button on the window it'll go to 500px wide.</p><p>When you click it again it goes back to where it was.</p><p>It's pretty helpful once you know what it's doing, but it seems totally random if you don't</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the best features of Transmit is that it includes an automator inferface, so your scripts can upload/download files too - very, very neat!  I've been using Directory Opus on my PCs for several years now, but I suspect Automator will make up for any limitations the out-of-the-box OSX finder has.  I'm going to be getting a Mini Mac soon, which will be really awesome - I've really grown to love iLife 06 and OSX Tiger at work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you can get your network drives to automount on startup by connecting to them (so they have an icon on the Desktop) and then dragging and dropping that icon into your Login Items (under the Accounts pref pane.) Of course, like any good tool, OS X gives you a number of other ways to do this, including using a shell script to mount the drives, and setting that script to run at login.</p><p>Alternatively, you could create a text clipping of the mount url (something like smb://user:pass@server/share) and drop that in the Login Items folder. This works well if you don't want to have to enter your password every time.</p><p>Glad you're still enjoying the machine!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>you probably already figured this out but maybe someone who reads it hasn't. Spotlight is your best friend, one of the things I use it most for is to find a snippet of code that I can't remember exactly what I did before. Most windows people are used to having to put the actually file name into a search and hope that windows actually finds it... sometime.. hours later.... But spotlight indexes all the items contents to so you could say put in part of the code and spotlight will show you were it is. Sounds dumb but it is a huge time saver.</p></div>
