		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, what an ending. Michael is clearly doing this on the premise that he will somehow get Walt back if he infiltrates his own crew and kills them off or sets them up to be killed. Just look at the coming attractions for next week when you see Mr. Eko falling from a tree. (And if they kill him off, I will have some serious words with Michael.) Also, there's no way the Others could let Michael escape from "crossing the line" unless he struck some sort of deal with them. The one thing you don't know is whether or not Michael actually kills the hostage after shooting himself or if he lets him go (I'm assuming he lets him go).</p><p>Finally, I had a feeling that Ana Lucia and Libby would get knocked off somehow because I've read in several places that the cast and crew all hated Michelle Rodriguez (prima donna) and Cynthia Watros has signed on to a pilot on another network.</p><p>PS -- Ray, how do you know that it was one of Jack's mistresses that the Dad went to see? Why couldn't it have been  the dad's from another drunken escapade? Did I miss a reference?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm  not so sure that Michael is killing other survivors of his own free will. I wonder if he hasn't been turned or brainwashed somehow, since he performs his killings quickly yet with intense personal reactions, almost as if he could react to his own actions but couldn't help himself. If he were doing it of his own free will, don't you think that he would show some hesitation or internal turmoil *before* pulling the trigger on his friends?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not sure what to think about Michael being brainwashed or under duress.  However, I wanted to discuss the commercial.  I totally missed it because I Tivo'd the episode.  When I read your blog, I went back to see it.  I have a theory on this, so follow me...</p><p>It's all about advertising dollars.  With the increased use of Tivo, the broadcasters know that fewer and fewer eyes are watching the commercials.  So, here is ABC, with a hit show that uses a subtle and intriguing method to get people to pay close attention to the commercials so that they won't miss a clue.  Makes the advertising costs for a slot in 'Lost' that much more of a premium.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well... He was acting more like he was under some sort of order. Maybe to get his boy they wanted him to kill Anna. From what Henry said, they seemed to want some sort of revenge for her killing their men on the other side of the island. Besides, he did apologize. That makes it OK, right? But Libby seemed more like an accident... She surprised him and he turned and fired on instinct. And he seemed.... momentarily.... upset.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah man, i don't really know what to think. there are a couple reasons i can think as to why Michael did what he did. the first one i thought of was that he bargained with the Others to get Walt back by freeing Henry. The other thought is that they are controlling Michael some how. Another reason could be that he is now an Other himself. He could have done it to inspire the other survivors to attack the Others. i don't think killing one of the best fighters (Ana Lucia) would be the best move for him to make if that was what he was trying to do.</p><p>One things for sure, Michael is holding a lot of cards right now.</p><p>I'm just so glad we don't have to wait 3-5 weeks to get a new episode!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I don't know if both Ana Lucia AND Libby are dead. In the preview for next week, someone said something like "She is dead. He killed her." All singular. Any thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My fiancee and I are wondering if Clair might be Jack's half-sister. There's got to be more to that story line. Or, is Clair's child Jack's sibling? I don't believe they ever talked about the father of Clair's child did they?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good ideas Dan. When Jack's dad first talked to the blonde at that house my girlfriend and I were shocked--thinking that it was Claire. Not Claire but there's probably more to come about this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan,</p><p>The father of Claire's child was in at least one of her first season flashbacks. Jack's father is not the father of Claire's baby. I do like the idea of Claire being Jack's half sibling though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jack's dad is starting to be really important now.</p><p>Andrew: I don't think that that was the same bar that Jack's dad talked to Sawyer. Ana almost ran him over, but i don't remember any "Sawyer" flashbacks where he almost got run over. maybe in season 3???</p><p>Switzer: I am feeling the Claire Jack connection big time. I think that Jack's dad is Claire's dad. The father of Aaron was shown in her first flashback ep. he was the one that convinced her to keep the baby and then when it was too late to have an abortion he changed his mind and left her ass.</p><p>I'm not sure why it would be important to the plot if Jack and Claire are half-siblings, but things change so much in this show so who the heck knows?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>At this point everyone's making assumptions that Libby is dead.  She was shot twice in the stomach and collapses, but we don't know if that killed her.  For all we know, she may have been carrying something behind those blankets that slowed the bullets.</p><p>The actress that played Anna Lucia stated in interviews after the show aired that she knew from the day she signed her contract that her run was limited and she'd be killed off the show.  Similar statements weren't heard, however, about Libby's character.  Anyone hear anything semi-conclusive?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Libby probably won't die, because they have to do her flashback sequence, unless she will be part of another flashback episode.  If anything she will probably slowly die over the next episode in between Eko and Locke fighting.  As far as Michael, he's being mind controlled to do the things he did.  Did you see how accurate he was when he shot the gun and how his hand trembled, like he didn't have control of it?  Assuming that doctors are controlling the island through the use of electromagnetism, this could be possible.  Just a thought!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One more thing, what about the fact that Jack's dad was looking for his daughter.  A blonde woman, in Austrailia, maybe Claire's mom?  Maybe JAck and her are half brother and sister?????   LOL!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First, Anna is our favorite character?  Actually I hate her and everyone else I know does as well.  Second, I wouldn't be surprised if Anna and Libby are only seriously wounded and not dead at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>RE: Claire's Baby and Jack's Father</p><p>I remembered them showing the boyfriend, but perhaps they're changing things up and the boyfriend wasn't really the father. I need to go back and watch the Claire flashback episode. I sort of remember her telling the boyfriend that the baby wasn't his, but blew it off as her making escuses to do what she wanted.</p></div>
