		<div class="comment_text"><p>Whoa. Lots of questions!</p><p>What happened to Eco and Locke? I'm assuming if the hatch blew that far - then if there were still in there - they are toast?  When the timer clicked down - it almost did look like there was an artificial light coming from the sky - I'm reminded of the movie The Truman Show for some reason...</p><p>The 'secret' map has me puzzled too?  Why not just do it on paper?  Why keep it hidden on the door in invisible paint?</p><p>In regards to Henry and the compass he could have simply gave them any direction knowing that in a few days (like Desmond) they would end up back at the island...</p></div>

Nothing "exploded". Also, wasn't Charlie in the hatch when the incident occured?</p><p>The status with four toes, has me googling all around. I think they just threw that in there.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with you Scott. Eko and Locke are alive and well. I would also think that Desmond is alive too because we still need a flashback as to why he was sent to prison. I know he disobeyed orders or something, but his reason and the orders were not explained.</p><p>No one mentioned that 'Kelvin' was the same guy that got Sayid to torture that guy for the first time.</p><p>Did anyone notice the look Jack gave to Kate before they were masked at the end? Was that an "I love you" look, or a "just stick to the plan" look??? they way Sawyer reacted i thought it to be more of an "I love you" type look...</p><p>I'm totally routing for Sayid to come in and infiltrate the others.</p><p>I'd also agree that those guys in the south pole were speaking either Portuguese or Spanish because i heard one say Por que' or something. I assumed russian at first too because they were playing chess. And we know Russians love there chess! Not really sure if it matters anyway...</p><p>I never really liked Michael, but i really hate him now. I have a kid too, but there's bound to be another path he could have taken to get Walt back. I hope he drowns in the ocean.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow. Lots to think about here. What I want to know is if the "system failure" is what caused the Oceanic plane to crash on the island, what brought all the other people to the island? For example, the drug plane, the hot air balloon and Desmond's boat. And that is just off the top of my head. I am sure there are more.</p><p>What is bringing all these people to the island other than the system failure?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Given that a drunken Desmond, referring to his inability to sail away from the island, calls their environment a "snow globe":  was anyone else fooled by the beginning of the last scene, where the camera slowly pulls away through a snowstorm before switching to the two men in the Quonset hut?  For the first few seconds of that scene, I thought they were going to pull a St. Elsewhere ending.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I guess it was a deck. I thought they were on the deck of a boat... looks like i was wrong. Was it a deck that was over water? maybe that's why i thought it was a boat? I guess i should dl the "Dave" episode and watch it again.</p><p>As far as the libby time line, no one knows, but i'd say that it went like this:</p><p>Husband dies.<br>She meets Desmond a month later and give him her boat.<br>checks in to mental hospital.<br>gets on plane.</p><p>We really need to get a libby flashback the explains how her husband dies and why she went nuts-o. Not everyone that loses a spouse checks in to the nut house. there had to be some trauma involved. What up with the wig/dyed hair too? Was she trying to disguise herself from someone? maybe Desmond in case they met on the island??? I mean, she gave him her boat. it would not be out of the realm of possibilities that she was working for Mr. Windham(or whatever) to get Desmond to go to the island.</p><p>Anyone remember what Desmond told Jack on the stairs at the stadium? or a link to quotes would be great!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No - but when the hatch door fell from the sky, my first thought that it was some other door... in the sky. I'm thinking that the island and the water around it are in some kind of container. Although the "go in one particular direction" to escape thing doesn't quite work with the idea.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A quick thought on Libby. She worked for Penny's dad and got Desmond a boat that she knew was doomed. This caused her to go crazy because she knew what she did was wrong. that's why she was in the cookoo bin with Hurley. not because her husband died. or it was a combination of the two events that stressed her out enough.</p><p>what do you think?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not so sure the pushing of the button has any truly devastating effects. "The Others" or "Good Guys" don't seem the least bit concerned about the button and whether it gets pushed. They would surely know about the button and if there were dire consequences, they'd ensure the button was pushed at all costs.</p><p>Also, remember that Walt supposedly made contact w/Michael via the computer. The whole button thing just seems off to me. I'm really not convinced that not entering the numbers caused the plane crash. There's way too many other ties between the passengers and the island.</p><p>Also, I heard someone mentioned that after the credits were over there was another scene of a plane crashing into the ocean. Can anyone confirm? Our news always shrinks the credits down to preview the late news--you can't see crap, so I don't really even continue to pay attention to the credits.</p></div>

I presume that he did have to enter the numbers, since we didn't see any "eruption" of light or hyper-magnetic activity. There's no evidence that the countdown can be averted just by crossing some wires.</p><p>But that leads me to another question... given that Henry himself pushed the button, why did he tell Locke afterward that he didn't, and that Locke shouldn't do so either? If Henry didn't want them to push the button, why did he look annoyed during the magnetic event in this latest episode? He should have looked gleeful if it's something he had wanted them to do.</p></div>

A mere wilderness, as you see, even now in December; but in summer a complete nursery of briers, a forest of thistles, a plantation of nettles, without any livestock but goats, that have eaten up all the bark of the trees.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The bird was the "Hurley-Bird." I think it's an inside joke that you will get if you've been listening to the official lost podcast. Fans were wondering why there's no birds on the island. I was speculating it was because the magnetic inerference that causes birds to have problems flying. Perhaps the Hurley-Bird is big enough that it isn't affected by it. Anyways, the inside joke; they were talking about a bird on Ouahu that make a sound sort of like "Hurrrleeyyy." So the bird did say Hurley's name. I'm not sure why it has a 20-ft wingspan though.</p></div>
