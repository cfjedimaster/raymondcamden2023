		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't plan on seeing the movie, and I enjoyed the book but was somewhat disappointed in it for the following reason: at first, I was enthralled by the intrigue of secret societies and by the intellectual challenge of the clues left behind. But as the book went on, it seemed like the clues never varied too much or became more complex. I guess I was hoping for a little bit more challenge from each clue as the book went on, not continuing word jumbles.</p><p>Back to the point-- I agree with you that the people who criticize the movie aren't being very trusting of the audience to do some critical thinking on their own.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Two comments:</p><p>First, I would hesitate to characterize what "The Catholic Church" is doing or believes.  As a Roman Catholic, I can tell you that there is an enormous variety in practice and personal belief among Catholics, and intense and varied theological debate about what defines "orthodox" Catholicism at every level of the Church.  In fact, there are over 30 recognized rites in the Catholic Church, and some are unrecognizable to Roman Catholics.  Some "userbases" are on the decline, while others (e.g., Africa) are on enormous upsurges.</p><p>Secondly, isn't the real problem we should be addressing (as many have already pointed out), what is so attractive about conspiracy theories that people leave their critical thinking at the door?  I think that is why (Americans, at least) love movies like Enemy of the State, and why the domestic spying program just confirms what we already suspected: they *are* all out to get us!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For that matter, I don't think it's correct to refer to "the protestations of the Catholic Church", since the Vatican actually had very little response to the movie. They were smart enough to realize that making too big of a protest would make the plot's theories appear to be legitimate.</p><p>If by "Catholic Church" you mean individual Catholics and ministers, then they certainly did give public protest. But the Vatican pretty much stayed out of it, so I don't think it's correct to say they gave any evidence of the plot hitting too close to home.  That's my two cents, at least.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First I meant no offense towards any Catholic (praticing or otherwise).  I realize that the non-american 'userbase' is growing, I also am aware that a majority of the problems occuring right now in the Catholic church are haapening in the US.  Actually I should mention that I'm speaking from a regional perspective (There are a *LOT* of unhappy Catholics in and around Boston right now.) and from conversations with my wife, who is Catholic along with almost her entire family.</p><p>*Anyway*, I'm still at a lose to explain why so many people feel so compelled to de-bunk a fictional story.  And de-bunking with references to biblical passeges that 'prove' this or that statement in the Davinci Code book is wrong.</p><p>Um... hello?  Part of the storyline in the book is that the Bible is wrong.  How can you point to book A to prove that book B is wrong when book B states that book A is wrong??</p><p>I think I just confused myself...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I may be in the minority, but I've always liked the trailers before movies. If I missed the coming attractions, I always felt like I missed out on part of the movie experience. Often the trailers showed the best parts of a movie, but it always gave you a decent sense on what was coming up.</p><p>That said, I absolutely dispise commercials. Promoting upcoming films is perfectly acceptable to me, but trying to sell me your wares when I pay good money ticks me off.</p><p>I shouldn't have to pay $7-10 per ticket to get bombarded with 20 minutes of product endorsements. I'll see enough of those during the movie.</p><p>This is actually a large reason why I've stopped going to the movies. Why end up spending $30 seeing a movie when I can buy the movie for $17 and watch it on my 55" TV in the privacy of my own house. You do miss out on part of the experience, but unless the movie is full of spectacular effects, I don't feel like I'm missing out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Da Vinci Code controversy is laughable.  What is the Catholic Church going to do, make a statement?  Governments won't collapse and riots won't happen over this.</p><p>However, the day any movie comes out that dares depict the Prophet of Islam is that day riots will rock across the globe and the production staff will go in hiding forever.  That is the real and immediate controversy I am worried about.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Imagine the dilemma of being completely uninterested in any of the structured religions of the world, yet being forced to tolerate all the media that results as half the world goes nutso over this movie.  Watching some of the furvored wild-eyed craziness of some of the people that speak up or even get the least bit excited about this is, at some level, frightening.  On the other hand, Tom Hanks is in it so that alone merits seeing the thing eventually if I can somehow avoid mixing in with the "point" - whatever the heck that is.</p><p>I agree with the other poster here.  I *want* to see the previews as part of the experience and feel like I'm missing something when I don't.  This isn't so much the case with the TV-like commercials, however.</p><p>Dave</p></div>
