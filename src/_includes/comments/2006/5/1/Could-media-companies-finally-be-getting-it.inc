		<div class="comment_text"><p>seriously I would love it if someone would start streaming Y&amp;R <br>the show has been run on free tv here in Australia since it started but was taken off last week to be shown on pay tv's W chanel. My husband doesnt want to pay $36.95per month plus set up fees so that I can watch it. I got into the show with my friends house bound great grandmother who watched it everyday. Im glad she is not alive to see this she would be devistated to know her 'stories' have been taken off the air.</p></div>
