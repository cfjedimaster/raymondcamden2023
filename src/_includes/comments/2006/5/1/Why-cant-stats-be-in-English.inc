		<div class="comment_text"><p>Some comments on my own post. Two smart people (my current PM and a friend) made good comments. First, my current PM said I should use color coding to signify bad or good. So you can imagine:</p><p>Your blog is getting much less traffic this week.</p><p>the "much less" would be in red. Darn good idea. Although it wouldn't work via RSS probably.</p><p>Then my friend suggested providng the numbers via roll over. I can see a nice tab ui instead. I wouldn't do a page reload, just a pagelet type thing like the flash forms tab UI. But you get the idea. Provide both immidiately.</p><p>Evan, I play HL2, but not much since I started playing Oblivion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No, it's really not more simple.  No, I can't imagine a client liking that over the numbers.  Just like I can't send a client an invoice with a total due of "a lot of money".</p><p>The problem is that statistics ARE numbers, and the interpretation of those numbers can be a very individual thing. What's "much better"?  Does your view of "much better" line up with my view?  Without the numbers you're really not saying anything.</p><p>And let's not forget the fact that people online actually READ very little.  Overall they scan, and the first version is perfect for that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would beg to differ Richard, and maybe the fault is mine for not being precise. I think "traffic" is a good example. It is always there. It's always moving up and down. That is different from a bill with a hard # (you owe me 1k).</p><p>It also doesn't have to be all the way. So for example, I can say:</p><p>You got 2,190 hits today, which is a bit more than yesterday.</p><p>As opposed to</p><p>Hits today: 2,190 (up 2%)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, I still don't see it.  Why would a person care enough to check their traffic, but be satisfied with a vague description of it?  And if you're going to start mixing the numbers into the text, why not put the numbers in a nice, easily scannable grid instead, a la version 1?  I can see adding a nice human description explaining the numbers, but only as a supplement to the numbers, not as the main info.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Several years ago (2001-ish?), I was asked to write a system for an affiliate network's usage reports.  Someone had the great idea to implement a system very similar to this, so that when they made their ad-hoc queries, the page would return an "English" title and "English" description along with the data.</p><p>Complex logic rules were written to relate the precedence of the data points to the precedence of English grammar -- so that important things came first, adjectives were used correctly, and parentheticals were interjected at the right place, for example.  Judicious use of bold, italics, and fixed-width fonts were even implemented.  The system didn't take *that* much time to develop, maybe a few developer-days, and it got put into production without any fanfare.  For complex queries you'd end up with paragraph-long descriptions of the data that was literally 50 pixels below in tabular form.</p><p>When we started doing usability testing a few months later (for the entire application, not just that one part), the users independently and unanimously voiced how much they hated that feature.  It bugged them to constantly have to scroll past it, "to get at the good stuff".  It was commented-out pretty quickly.</p><p>We ended up spending a few more developer-days on microindicators, instead.  Things like little 6px-by-3px color-coded arrows that flowed in the text to indicate rise and fall, smart-gradiated coloring of table rows (not just a red-yellow-green system, but actually calculating out accurate hex colors for shading, etc), and tiny 12x12 pie charts.  (Charts were done in Perl at the time, as that was long before cfgraph or cfchart.)  They were much more useful and much more liked and as far as I know stayed in the product for quite some time.</p><p>As "Richard" from above pointed out: when they were in the system they wanted data, not prose.  There's a reason why every news station known to man has an info-ticker at the bottom of it, and why the format of stock exhange information hasn't changed in decades.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray...</p><p>I've got to agree with Rick and Richard on this one, for several reasons.</p><p>1) If the data is worth reporting, it is important to the user. Can you imagine getting your quartely results from your investment portfolio that stated "You lost a little bit of money last quarter."</p><p>2) How do you quantify "A Little" or "A lot"? An increase of .7% per week does not sound like a lot, but that is an increase of 36.4% over the course of the year!  That may be incredible growth for a Utility company and mediocre growth for Google!</p><p>Your time is better spent on your other projects!</p><p>Congratulations on the new job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gus and Rick, I think you both make good points, but I want to be clear. I'm not saying get rid of the stats, but rather, for daily/hourly etc type stats where you are looking all day long, then it may be a nice alternative. Gus, your example of a quarterly report is a good example of something that would not work good in what I was proposing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can only imagine looking over a report written like this for 30 servers. The report file would be the size of War and Peace.

However, over the last month your traffic has increased.</p><p>At a glace I know you DOUBLED your traffic from yesterday. Week long traffic is at a 10% increase and a 20% increase for the past month. How does "much better", "hasn't seen much movement" and "your traffic has increased" tell me that?</p></div>
