I am interested in it after seeing your weekly comments and especially if they have these websites that offer clues to the shows.</p><p>The question I have is we have seen folks attemping to tie in television shows and the internet before.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok... I've made some progress... Go back to the Hanso Site... Do the Newsletter login again. ie. breaking strain... after that go back to the executive bios and ty Heir Apperant into the box in the middle of Dr. Mittelwerk's page... Watch what happens... Do it again after it resets it seemed to show a little more the second time. The look at Hanso's Bio again and now you can click the date under his picture.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Juggler - I noticed the 'psychic' right away.</p><p>Ray - the guns would add the the realism for those being watched  in the Swan.  As for the drawing on teh door.  Well, there were times whenthere were 2 people in the hatch.  They could have taken turns exploring.</p><p>Since Desmond explained the numbers and such, I suspected this was some kind of experiment(I know, so did many others(no pun intended)).</p><p>I guess my theory about Libby being an 'Other' is pretty much shot to hell, since we see her at the airport in Sydney.</p><p>Does anyone else remember that when John and Boone first found the airplane near the 'Pearl', he began to lose feeling in his legs and have trouble walking?</p><p>One other thing, and this is me nit picking, when Jack, effectively, overdosed Libby with heroin, her pupils appeared to be slighty dilated. Heroin (and other opium based drugs) actually cause your pupils to constrict.  With a dose high enough to kill someone, a person's pupils woudl be so small, you would barely be able to see them. I know this has noting to do with the plot or story, just something I noticed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My nitpick about last night's episode: When Libby leaves Hurley to get the blankets, its daytime. She gets shot in the hatch. Jack and co. approach the hatch in darkness and find Michael stumbling out. Then, when Sawyer and Kate go to get the heroin for Libby, its daylight outside again. Did all that happen overnight? Or was something weird going on? Only then does Hurley ask them about Libby - he wasn't wondering what happened to her when she left him to go to the hatch the previous day?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stroz: My theory on the psychic is that he is a fraud, but his daughter is not. if you remeber, the Psychic told Claire over the phone to got the LA on flight 815. He could have been told by his daughter that something was going to happen which motivated him to call her so much.</p><p>As for the rest of the episode, i thought it was really good and will help lead into a great finale.</p><p>I think the reason Locke was in a wheelchair is going to be huge to the storyline. I do think it's curious why locke's legs gave out when he a Boone were there in season 1. While i'm on Locke, in his last flashback episode when he gave his dad the money did it show him taking his share? it was a couple hundred grand right? but then he is later shown (earlier in Season 1) working in a box company and living in a crappy apartment...</p></div>
