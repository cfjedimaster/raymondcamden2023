		<div class="comment_text"><p>Kameo's second demo.  It has five scenarios that you can try out.  BTW this is a 1 gb download.. Anyway, first scenario, you get to play for 1 minute.. Then the rest of the scenarios range from 3-7 minutes. <br>One minute! can you really evaluate a product for a minute?</p><p>Anyway..interesting post and I agree with you Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Prey demo has an exclamation of  "I'll find you &lt;whatever the girl who was kidnappeds name was&gt; I promise!" and then a screen saying about how wonderful the full game is, you can't skip it, however thats what the guide button is for, thankgod.</p><p>And the quake demo was *extremely* disappointing, i couldn't believe it either,, i only got a little into the demo and due to my extreme suckage i died almost instantly, but i loved the handling, the game looked amazing, the weapons felt great, the enemies cool, but im not sitting through that damned intro again, no way no how.</p><p>Also one of the racing games has a margin of sillyness in it, i cant remember which one (maybe PGR3?) where you can race, you finish it, and it clearly has an option to restart the race, but you can't , you gotta go back to the menu, choose the track which there is only one of, and then repick your cars yada yada, so damned irritating!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jesus, agreed. Although - I loved the Prey demo. I didn't finish it - but the scene in the bar when things go crazy was one of the best moments I've had in my life of playing games. I've decided not to finish the demo and I just added the game to my wishlist. (Consider that a hint to anyone out there. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Prey demo is excellent and also its not like a racing game, where you have one track, this thing is like 6 levels almost, absolutely huge, takes a good 40 mins to complete the demo, you have to have a strong as hell stomach though, theres a lot of "Gravity" play where things just become so screwed it, its hard to know whats up and whats down.</p><p>seems polished though!</p></div>
