		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, I couldn't agree with you more.  <br>&lt;rant&gt;<br>There are so many cruel sports that 'we' as an educated society don't need. Have we not moved forward from our neanderthalic days that we need to see brutality displayed in such a way?  If you want blood sport, sadly all you have to do is watch the news... <br>&lt;/rant&gt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just playing devil's advocate here, but in many countries around the world, cock fighting is quite popular and deeply ingrained in the culture.  It's much less so here in the US, but that's not true of many of the immigrant populations that come here and can't understand why it's illegal.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it does depend on the cultural context in which you place it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Mike,</p><p>While I do agree with you to a point, is it not that very notion of excessive cruelty that's being discussed here. Agreeing that cock-fighting is nasty and should be banned is based on agreeing on its cruelty...no? I mean, if they were cock-wrestling for sport, it might not be an issue (sorry for being trite there). In that same vein, is eating factory farmed meat not supporting a particular form of nasty cruelty...?? (that wasn't supposed to be a not-so-subtle stab there either)</p><p>Further to Rob's point, I have been in countries where folks think that us in the west are almost funny in our selective adoration of certain animals...i.e. rescue puppies, and chow down on some cow.</p><p>This thread makes for some very funny terminology.</p><p>peace</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm a Louisiana native (born in Shreveport) and I think that Louisiana has some unique qualities:  great food, great music, and down-to-earth people.  And while there have been difficulties, Louisiana is probably one of the more diverse states in this country.  However, the political corruption and the complete farce of an education system has continued to keep the majority of the population mired in ignorance.  While I'm impressed that they finally elected a female governor, I fear that Blanco and members of the House are simply going to pander to the voting block.</p><p>BTW:  See you at CFUNITED!  Perhaps I can recommend that you pack light and don't check any bags this time.  :)</p></div>

There is no doubt in my mind that PETA is on the right side of history. What they are trying to accomplish is noble. Their overall strategy and tactics are just terrible.</p><p>I was just having a conversation about this with a PETA person the other day. The sad thing is they don't even seem to realize that people don't like PETA. Oh well. Next time i'll tell them to go after cock fighting instead of the circus.</p></div>

Both are used as a means to your end (your enjoyment/enhancement/whatever you want to call it). If you're saying animals have rights - which they don't, and neither do "we" except in a political sense (i.e., we grant them to ourselves) -, then they cannot be used as merely a means. Read your Kant, if that's your position, then come back and talk about "intelligence."</p><p>Again, what about trout fishing, Rui? Are you also campaigning for it to be banned? Deer hunting?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray and all,</p><p>This comment is most likely too late to be of any use or even to be seen, but I couldn't let it go. <br>My point above (which I thought was clear) was not that eating meat is bad (as I mentioned I hunt for my own meat)...it was an attempt to move the discussion from the cruelty of cock-fighting to cruelty in general. Opposing cock-fighting due to it's cruelty and being fine with factory farmed meat is a rather silly incarnation of western philosophical convenience in my opinion. Cows are arguably much more capabale of 'understanding' the fear of death and pain than a chicken (somewhat kin to a smart cockroache). To jump up and down about cockfighting while turning a blind eye to farming animals (in the most ghastly and inhumane way), and to then base it on 'well cruelty to cows (or whatever) is alright since I eat them and eating is alright, but since cock-fighting is just sport...well that cruelty is bad' just seems to be a very hollow argument in my opinion.</p><p>Thanks for the soapbox Ray....I would have loved to hear your response, but alas...</p><p>peace</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What makes you think I won't respond? :) From what I know, and I could be wrong, when cows are killed for food, it was a fast and quick death. (Although not painless.) While not perfect, I do find this accceptible. Animals were put here for us to eat. Now if the cows were killed in a long drawn out process I'd consider it cruel.</p></div>

I just can´t understand this argument. To be against war in Iraq, do I have to mention the whole list of wars in the world?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>and Ziggy, I guess it's too late now, but let me tell you that I don´t know much about philosophy. But I was hoping that wasn´t necessary to understand that hurting and killing for pleasure is not "right". If it is, well, I guess we're in big trouble.</p><p>Anyway, I didn´t say that animals have rights. I just don´t like people to hurt them for fun. How inteligent is this concept?</p></div>
