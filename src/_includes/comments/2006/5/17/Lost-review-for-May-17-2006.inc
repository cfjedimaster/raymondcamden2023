		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt; and what made the plane crash.</p><p>This just makes me believe my original theory (from the beginning of this season) that they are all lab rats in a large test environment.  Because corporations pretty much run the world we now know, something like this is very possible.  Due to the websites we've seen lately I'm leaning towards thinking its some kind of drug-related company doing tests on humans (like you might do on lab rats).</p><p>However, I like what you've brought up tonight... that maybe some of the Others are some kind of experiments as well.  But like the French woman experienced, people "mysteriously" crash on the island.  Would it not be possible for sabotage from a corporation?</p><p>Do you think its possible that some governments partially work with said corporation(s) (giving them some reign to do these tests for a better cause)?</p><p>&gt; How do they know Sawyer's real name?</p><p>Still same theory.  If its a well funded compant then I'm sure they have no problem purchasing such information.</p><p>...<br>My wife suggested something tonight.  What if these people were planted there and the plane crash never happened?  She left it at that but it really got me thinking.  I mean, its possible the people could have been brain washed or led to believe some things.  It would explain why in their flashbacks they sometimes come across other people from the island (their minds might be trying to piece together a story and new false characters are entering into their minds).</p><p>I know, its a stretch, but its a theory I hadn't heard yet :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just used my Tivo to slowly skip frame-by-frame of those last fast-moving scenes we see of the season finale preview.</p><p>In it it shows Locke swinging and axe (or club/stick) at the computer and what looks like Eco's arm reaching out to stop it just in time.  My Tivo cuts off just as Eco's arm reaches in to stop him. So there may be more there.  There is also a scene where Sawyer is kicking-in a piece of wood on the sailboat, and another scene showing Sayid on the sailboat with binoculars.  His face looks as if he's just seen something... like an "uh oh" something.</p><p>Overall, I think Scott's right.  They'll likely follow the theme most successful mystery shows take where they'll answer many questions and leave you with new ones.  I'm looking forward to it though :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't been able to get the new site to work (the one from the new commercial).  Too many people hitting the site that I get timeouts.  Every now and then I'm lucky enough to get the HTML, but not the SQF needed for the page.</p><p>Funny, if you view the source it says "Thank you and Namaste,".  Now, my Hindi is very rusty, but I believe that is a greeting (I believe "Namaste gee" is a formal greeting for "hello").  So my question, is the Hindi related... another piece to the puzzle?  Or is that just a programmer getting a little coder message in there?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw one more thing in the fast-frame preview for next week. It was Sawyer firing a gun in one frame and then the very next frame showed a lunging Kate as if someone or something hit her from behind. Did he shoot her by accident or out of spite thinking that Jack slept with her? As usual, it could just be a complete mash-up to throw us off, but that got me thinking about one of the key mantras of the show: Nobody Is Safe.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have an idea about why Eko is staying in the hatch. Remember how in this episode he mentions to Locke that they didn't find any trail to track down Henry after he escaped? I think it's because there is no trail... Henry hasn't left the hatch, and I think Eko knows this.</p></div>

I think that most of the things that happened were sort of a confirmation of what we all thought happened to Michael. I really hope that Sayid and some other badasses follow the group as backup.</p><p>Did anyone get a chance to figure out what the hatch the other's were gaurding was labeled? it was some sort black background with a white rectangle or something? We have the swan, staff(the one claire found) and the pearl(the observation hatch found last week). I'm sure i could find it on that lostpedia site. I'll let you know if i do.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>thanks ray! no idea what that could be, but on lostpedia they were assuming that all the hatches are named after Apollo or constellations or something. I didn't really understand it but they had predicted the staff  the arrow and the pearl already. i don't think there was one called the box or cell or something like that.</p><p>If you look at the map that was on the blast door, you can see a hatch that is scribbled out that would be due north of the Swan station. I wonder if that is the "Box" or whatever they will call it???</p></div>

I think everyone on the beach would be totally pissed off if they all discovered they were being toyed with. A few people at a time the others can handle.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is for real....</p><p>Lost action figures... with kung-fu grip!</p><p>Okay, maybe not with kung-fu grip. "Faces in perpetual states of shock, horror, and/or 'WTF'-ness" are more likely. Anyway, McFarlane Toys are coming out with a new line of Lost action figures of season one's "fan-favorites", Jack, Kate, Locke, Hurley, Charlie, and Shannon. They've just released a picture of the Charlie figure . He's sitting down, writing on his fingers. Hmm... Doesn't look very action-y. McFarlane Toys is also releasing boxsets, little dioramas that recreate key moments of the show. So, if you don't like the season finale, you can always film your own.</p><p>Maybe it's just me, but the choice of Shannon to be a part of the first set of "fan-favorite" toys comes as a bit of a surprise. If I had to go for one of the deadsies for this first set, I would have picked a Boone figure over a Shannon one. The fact that I found Boone attractive has nothing little to do with it. The toys are expected Fall of this year.</p></div>
