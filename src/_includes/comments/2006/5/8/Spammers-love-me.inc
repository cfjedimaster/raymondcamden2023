		<div class="comment_text"><p>I tend to be getting a ton of trackback spam at a time. It has got to be a robot or a script. I end up with 20 or so stupid spam links which, thanks to the kill link in the email informing me of the trackback added I delete quickly.</p><p>I know that you have added CAPTCHA to the comments in BlogCFC 5 -- could it be added as an option to trackback? I suppose I could just turn off trackback for all of my older posts...</p><p>Thanks, again, Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Leif, TBs are added two ways. Either via the pop up or a remote FORM post. Most TB spam comes from the remote FORM post. It's part of the TB spec in general but if you want, you can disable it and only allow TBs via the pop up. That's what Forta did.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I had the same. It seems they use it to submit comment spam to new posts. The last 2 weeks I'm getting insane numbers of comments on my blog... I just can't wait for the comments CAPTCHA option in V5 ;)</p></div>
