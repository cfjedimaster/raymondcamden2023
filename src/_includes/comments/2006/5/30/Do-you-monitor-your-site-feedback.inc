		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Although I am not one of the culprits you are referring to directly, I am guilty of not having the error handling setup correctly (or at all).  I know that you wrote an entry about this some time ago and I can't seem to find it.  Any chance you could create a "Quick Guide" that adresses the various CF error handling methods?</p><p>Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We have many clients who have paid outside developers for their (very poorly done) development work, and for any number of reasons the client chooses to not continue to do business with the original developers. The contact forms, along with error notifications, go to (for instance) webmaster@ and either 1) no one is monitoring that email address or 2) the person(s) who do get the webmaster emails know they won't get the "powers that be" to approve funds to engage the services of someone who can diagnose and repair the issue, so unless *everyone* is complaining about something not working or the error/problem is significantly impacting revenue they know nothing will be done about it and just ignore the emails. I suppose they assume it's better to pretend the email disappeared into dev/null than to reply "yeah, that happens occasionally but we're not going to bother paying someone to fix it". Not all web site owners have developer resources in-house or on retainer to bring to bear for each small problem encountered. Most have already signed off on the development work so whoever wrote the code has no responsibility for any remaining fixes that would normally be considered warranty work, and many have had experiences with developers that make them loathe to engage them (or anyone else) again unless something is hitting them hard in the pocketbook.</p><p>This may not be the case with the specific sites you are blogging about in this entry, but it is one reason you may encounter unresponsiveness.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also keep in mind, that no matter how trivial the dev task is, it sometime takes weeks to go live. here are a few examples.<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;the file is locked by another developer in sourcesafe, whose ticket has to be finished/tested/uploaded...&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;the company has layers upon layers of bureaucracy/procrastination, which makes every ticket take ages to be taken care off&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;The client is king, and the decision makers(who are not  technical people) have decided that new dev is MUCH important than optimization of the current app.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;</p><p>So maybe the developers saw you email (or maybe it's the zillionth in the queue) but just couldn't get to do the job</p></div>
