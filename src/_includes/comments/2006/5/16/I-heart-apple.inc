		<div class="comment_text"><p>Last year, when shopping for my PowerMac G5 I successfully haggled with a clerk who agreed to throw in a $450 NVidia card for free if I would agree to take one of the stock configurations on the shelf.  While I ended up purchasing a custom machine online because at the register the cashier gave me a little bad news about another component that ended up changing my mind, I do want to highlight how open the showroom floor clerk was to negotiating with me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hope you took that $300 and invested in Applecare so when a manufacturing defect shows up after a year(like not soldering the graphics chip properly to the logic board). Otherwise Apple will politley ask you whether you would like to give up on the machine or gladly purchase a new one.</p><p>Am I bitter? Yes, as I stare at my 15 month old iBook.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The answer is yes... well, sort of. I purchased an Alienware laptop several months ago (now owned by Dell). A week after placing my order, they released a newer version of their laptops which resulted in my machine being $450 cheaper. I called, like you, expecting a fight, and after explaining the issue to them and preparing to yell at them, they told me a credit would be issued to my credit card. No questions, no hesitation, nothing. Needless to say I was surprised.</p><p>Apple on the other hand would not replace my ipod mini because it was 7 months after I bought it (1 month past my included warranty) despite the fact that "oh yeah, the first batch of these had bad hard drives". Mine just took a little longer to die I guess and so I had to pay $45 to get a replacement.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No offence Will, but they sound like two different situations, one is one week and the other is SEVEN months. I mean, you had that iPod for a long while, you could have scratched it (common) you would have added all your music, used it, dropped it, played netball with it. The laptop, well, you would have had it a week, or if as in Ray's case, it was not even dispatched, its no skin of their nose, and they can sell the other laptop in their refurb store, or put it back in stock for other stores.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's awesome.</p><p>I'm strictly a Dell user, and every time I have ever bought one, it seems like the next day they slashed their prices.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's consistent with their after-sales policy; apple provides you price protection for 10 calendar days, and also offers a 14-day return (with 10% resstocking fee); check prices section on this doc: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.apple.com%2FCatalog%2FUS%2FImages%2Fsalespolicies.html%3AGKdYbhZNx7EENx273ToqhGcwB6Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/salespolicies.html">http://store.apple.com/Cata...</a></p><p>I have to call them to see if applies here in the UK though; and I got a 15"/2.16ghz/2gig/7200rpm configuration exactly 10 days ago :)</p></div>

I just got a 17" MacBook Pro for my side business but at my main job, they won't let me bring it in to our network for fear of bringing in a virus!  Haha.  Have to use Windows only at work.
