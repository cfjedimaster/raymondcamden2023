		<div class="comment_text"><p>How many users will this technique support?  It uses a CF thread for each download and it could easily choke on large files or multiple simultaneous downloads.</p><p>We've switched to a FTP server that uses an ODBC database for the user accounts (SurgeFTP or Serv-U), create a randomized user account on-the-fly with privileges set to download only with a upload/download ratio of 1:1... which means that the download link will only work once and all of the heavy lifting is removed from ColdFusion and the web server.</p><p>The database has a datestamp field and is used for a clean-up script that deletes old user accounts (1:1 ratio used up) and the download file is also deleted.</p><p>I really want to figure out how to protected downloads using Flash so that Flash can report back to the server after a successful download and automate the clean-up process.  This will also remove the heavy lifting from CF (but not the webserver.)  There is a java applet that will do this... but I don't want to force someone to install java just to download a file whereas most users already have Flash installed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What happens when you use the CFCONTENT tag?  Isn't a ColdFusion thread used during the entire download process?  If you have the server configured to handle 8 simulutaneous requests, won't your website be unresponsive if 8 large files (er, requests) are currently in use by multiple 56k modem users?</p><p>I'll only use CFCONTENT for extremely small files or dynamically generated content (ie excel spreadsheet). When it comes to large files (or very popular files), I'll use the hash technique and then CFLOCATE to either a password protected FTP account (after email address verification testing is successful) using my instructions (above) or anonymous FTP with a hashed filename.</p><p>It only becomes a real issues when the content being downloaded is either being personalized or is being paid for.</p></div>
