		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did study boolean algebra at uni too and really liked it. As far as maths are concerned, I've never been interested by anything but this subject, and set theory(SQL). Whatever I learned I though "what the hell do I care if I want to program?". Those 2 areas of maths immediately struck a chord, and again, appart from what I learned when I was 7(+/*-), that's the also the only maths I use in my job. I don't know about the US, but in France, maths are way too advanced if you don't study straight maths. I studied accounting before computer science and had two math modules: financial math, composed of series and other similar things, which makes a lot of sense (i.e. mortgage calculation), and standard maths like differential equations, complex numbers and whatnot. Some people say doing advanced math, even unrelated, is a good thing as it hones you problem-solving skills, and logic, but  if you ask me, I've always felt it was total waste of  time, and could be used for things that are more important(for whatever you do, that is. I'm certainly not saying that maths are useless!). For example, most students with me at uni couldn't speak or understand much english, when all the programming you do is english-based, and so is a good chunck of the available knowledge (blogs, tutorials...). Speaking of which, for the first time yesterday, I checked out the french coldfusion community, and realized it was pretty much inexistant. I've also never heard of french guys in the english-speaking community. maybe I should start a blog in both french and english, hey?</p><p>Anyhoo, sorry for the long comment, and if it looks like I'm ranting, but I'd be curious to know what you guys think. Do you feel you did more maths than you should have? whatever complicated stuff you've learned, have you ever used it at work, and if a company needs to write math-intensive code , can't they hire a coder AND a mathematician?</p><p>tof</p></div>

I didn't know the technical term, but I do know that other languages don't support it. They go on to check the status of the other side of an AND before returning the result, which, as I understand it, can be maddening at times. Since CF is pretty much the only language I use a lot (other than MXML, AS, JS, and SQL, that is) I can't honestly speak to their pain. ;)</p><p>Laterz,<br>J</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tof,</p><p>I've always found that there is a big difference between a "waste of time" and "not knowing what it's used for".  Having gotten my Master's in CS focusing on AI, let me tell you that a lot of the learning techniques used today could not have been done without a lot of complex math.  I'm sure this applies to many other areas as well, but AI is the one I'm most familiar with.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a side note, I know that using 'StructKeyExists()' is faster than 'IsDefined()', but surely it is better to use 'IsDefined()' with multiple nested structures, like:</p><p>&lt;cfset foo = {}&gt;<br>&lt;cfset foo['bar'] = {}&gt;<br>&lt;cfset foo['bar']['foo'] = {}&gt;<br>&lt;cfset foo['bar']['foo']['bar'] = {}&gt;<br>&lt;cfset foo['bar']['foo']['bar']['foo'] = "bar"&gt;</p><p>Otherwise a conditional to test for this could get quite busy:</p><p>&lt;cfif StructKeyExists(foo,"bar") AND StructKeyExists(foo['bar'],"foo") AND StructKeyExists(foo['bar']['foo'],"bar") AND StructKeyExists(foo['bar']['foo']['bar'],"foo")&gt;<br>#foo['bar']['foo']['bar']['foo']#<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;</p><p>As opposed to:</p><p>&lt;cfif IsDefined("<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoo.bar.foo.bar.foo%3ASvkF4CBI3LTtUA5OMJWY6A5dXjQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="foo.bar.foo.bar.foo">foo.bar.foo.bar.foo</a>")&gt;<br>#foo['bar']['foo']['bar']['foo']#<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, it's hard to know what I was thinking over a decade ago (grin), but while this is obvious to most programmers, I can imagine it may not be for folks who may come to development from a non-traditional background. Even if it does, the idea that you can have a Y that would throw an error normally but is safe if X is true may not be something they understand.</p></div>
