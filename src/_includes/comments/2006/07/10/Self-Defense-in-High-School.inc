		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great idea. Although self defense is should only be used to hurt the attacker in order to get away from them. Not to sit there and have a full fledge fight.</p><p>The best self defense: break their knee. I don't care if the guy is 100 or 500 pounds. One kick and they're done. Most people tell women to go for the groin which does work, but the problem is the attacker can still run after you. No body is getting up from a broken knee.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree Ray. I think the problem with kids is there isn't enough physical activity for them. Taking away sports like this from gym and replacing with self-defense would only contribute to the growing problem of overweight/not physically active kids. The other question would be are kids mature enough to learn self-defense and not practice on each other in the hallways afterwards. I, personally, don't think they are.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The maturtiy level issue is a tough one.  I am currently studying several self-defense systems.  Not the martials arts type either.  Real self-defense, the type you should use your life is in danger.  But knowing when to use this type of violence to defense one self is the tough part.  I say violence because that is exactly what it is. When your life is danger because of asocial violence (as oppose to social violence), you either leave the situation (preferable), or respond back with violence before its too late.  But that takes responsability and I don't know if high school kids are ready for that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Phil, I agree that weight is a huge issue for kids today. However, I'd rather have my daughter have these skills than be skinnier. And be honest - you had gymn like I did. Did the activity "stick" with you? It didn't with me. But these skills (self defense) could help for the rest of your life.</p><p>Also - how can you 'practice' on others in the hallways the skills of escaping from an attacker? That's why I said it shouldn't be karate.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, the practicing would be if you teach someone how to escape being grabbed from behind kids will grab each other from behind and see what happens, throws, trips, punches to the groin, whatever they were taught. As for the "stick with you", I can't answer that fairly. I play and watch sports regularly, so yes, it all did stick with me for the most part the games I learned. But again, I think I'm the exception, not the norm. I'd actually prefer gym class to be less about sports, and more about lifestlye things like nutrition and fitness. It can include sports, but from a social aspect so people at least have an idea of what the sport is about, but you can get that without playing it for 5 weeks or more.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I practice small circle jujitsu (which focuses on more real world situations) and my sensei is considering letting his 15 year old join, but he's been in trouble for fighting before, so he was told, "If you come to class, and you ever use any of this knowledge for anything other than self defense, we will take you into the dojo, lock the door, and you will show us exactly what you did." :) Personally, I think learning some self defense is a great idea, but I think Phil makes a good point about lawsuits, especially in today's schools. I think it's something that the parent should consider enrolling the child in outside of school.</p><p>And gym class sucked beyond 4th grade. :)</p></div>

It would be nice if schools could effectively train kids how to react in certain situations (kidnapping, etc) but I'd rather teach them martial arts myself. It's a good way to get exercise for you and your family, spend time with the kids, and teach discipline and responsibility.</p><p>How about schools teaching kids about gun safety and how to handle, clean and use firearms?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Are you kidding - teach kids to attack each other? I know that's not your intention, but (and as always, having to look at it this way sucks) I can just see the lawsuits as kids use their school-taught skills on each other: in fun, jest, or as part of the bullying. It's unfortunate, but if you teach kids how to injure, then you've opened your school to liability.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I totally hear what you are saying.</p><p>It seems to be that you would be advocating a program that takes more of a violence avoidence path, than one of reaction once the violence has started, which I couldn't agree with more.</p><p>As someone who has studies martial arts for quite a few years, I'm often disgusted with alot of the 'self defense' programs I see - especially those that are of the type that say 'if he grabs your wrist, turn and do X, Y and Z'.</p><p>a) The focus should be more on being aware of your surroundings, and ensuring you aren't in a position to be grabbed in the first place.  How to not look like a target, how to walk confidently, ensuring you stay in groups etc.  This is going to save your life 9 times out of 10 than being able to do a wrist lock if the guy happens to grab your wrist the right way.</p><p>It scares me how often people put themselves in seriously dangerous situations because they think 'they will be okay'. As a species, humans are the only ones around that tend to ignore their fear emotions.</p><p>b) Doing half a dozen repetitions of a bad move against an unresisting opponent during a 2 day course is in no way going to prepare you for a violent assault.  If push actually comes to shove, and you are serious about being prepared to actually defend yourself, you need to be training for it (and TKD at the local Y is probably not going to do it).  Failing that, go back to section 1 - just don't be there in the first place.</p><p>c) That being said, on the teaching kids thing - through the years I've been training, I've seen younger kids with no confidence really develop under martial arts tutalege, and also seen some 'bad seeds' turn into some really nice kids.  So it can definatley be a plus in a lot of cases.</p><p>However, the aspect of teaching it in schools is that the Teacher is severly restricted in terms of being able to hurt the student - and yes, martial arts IS about fighting, so there is going to be a pain aspect, and also may not have the option of throwing the student out of the class - which can severly limit his/her power over the class body, and therefore students are more liable to take advantge.</p><p>I know my kids (whenever they come around) will be learning to defend themselves, but they will also be learning the aspects of discipline that accompany that.  I don't want to turn them into killing machines, but there are alot of valuable lessons to be learnt through martial arts, one of which is personal safety.</p></div>

The students were drawn from all over the city, so we rode subways and buses everyday.</p><p>We were taught how to properly sit like ladies, how to walk, how to talk, how to set a table, how to cook. We were also taught advanced math, physics and chemistry. During our gym classes, we were taught a lot of things -- one thing I particularly remember is how to defend yourself from perverts on the subway.</p><p>It was quite useful information; you'd be surprised (or maybe not) on how many perverted men there are who think nothing about feeling up the butt of a little girl.
