		<div class="comment_text"><p>I loved it. In fact, as time passes, my appreciation for it grows. It is definitely on my list of top movies now. In case people are curious:</p><p>Vanilla Sky<br>Star Wars (all)<br>Godfather (part 1 and 2)<br>Pulp Fiction, Sin City, Kill Bill, basically anything Tarantino related, even Jackie Brown which I just saw recently and thought was great)<br>The Conversation (old school movie, one of Harrison Ford's early flicks)<br>Closet Land (indie film)</p><p>and lots of others. I'm just a huge movie lover I guess.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>L Ron Hubbard is quoted as saying "The only way to make money in this life is to start a religion".  I guess the scifi novel business wasn't cutting it for him.  If you want to learn more about The Cult of Scientology just go watch Southpark's twelfth season 9 episode, "In the Closet".</p><p>Ray, what about The Princess Bride or Donnie Darko or Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Aliens (Special Edition) or Ladyhawke?  Those are some of my favorites.</p><p>Damien</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Folks, please drop the religion talk or this thread will turn into IdiotBait. (Remember my post last week. ;)</p><p>Damien: Ditto Princess Bride. I'm adding it to my wishlist now as I think my kids need to see it. Ferris is of course awesome. I haven't seen Donnie Darko and yes, I know I need to. Ladyhawke is one of my favorite films. I like how the "fantasy" aspect of it is "lite" and not overwhelming.</p><p>And Aliens. How could I forget Alien/Aliens. I even liked part 3 and 4. But the first two are amazing. I can't wait till my kids are old enough to see them. Can you imagine those films, in HD, in the dark?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I only read about hostel, never saw it, but I made up my mind pretty darn quick that I never wanted to see it.  It sounds just frigging nasty.  I'm all for weird stories 'n all but movies like that shouldn't get an R-rated release, it should be NC17, likewise for any movie that the main focus is violent torture and/or r*pe ("Saw" series, THHE, etc).  Heck, my wife and I went to see Underworld 2 and there were at least two families with young children there who sat through the entire movie, and *it* was pretty darn gruesome at times.</p><p>In comparison, while "Sean of the Dead" (simply awesome flick) was a bit icky at points it was quite obviously tongue in cheak and campy, which puts a completely different spin on it.</p><p>Damien</p></div>
