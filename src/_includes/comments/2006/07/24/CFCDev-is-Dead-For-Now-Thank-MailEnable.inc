		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just a thought.  Maybe you could look at the hosted gmail program: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fhosted%2FHome%3AYSUFwxlgxQa1Iothetw8hY653O0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.google.com/hosted/Home">https://www.google.com/host...</a>.  Couple that with a group in Google groups, and maybe you push all the tedious mail administration and the constant spam fight to them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,</p><p>Why don't you just have a forum (like Galleon) for this. ListServs are so 1990 and you can see the problems with them. My biggest gripe with them is that there is no history with them, once a post is made it's gone unless you setup an archive with your mail program. Sure there are some ListServs that are more feature rich (like CF-Talk), but the majority of them are just email blasts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I share a server with a few other people (most notably Doug Hughes and Joe Rinehart) and we recently had to switch servers.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Scott, is that import tool part of SmarterMail? Where can I find it. Also, did it import email as well? ie, if user X has messages in their account, will it suck it in?</p><p>Scott, you just saved my day. I assumed there wasn't any such tool.</p></div>
