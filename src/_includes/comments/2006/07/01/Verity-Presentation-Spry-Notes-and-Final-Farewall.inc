		<div class="comment_text"><p>Looking forward to the Spry demo . . . I didn't quite understand the degradation part and would like to see an example of that.  I'm visual and need to see examples in order to get an idea of what is being discussed.  I thought this session was a good introduction, although he was nervous, I agree with you.  (Speaking of which, I have more observations to add later to your post about being a speaker)  I did find Spry more easier to follow than cfAjax in terms of programming strategy.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Lola: Discussion of "degradation" in the context of Ajax libraries refers to how the application behaves in browsers that may have an older version of Javascript that may not have some of the needed functions, or may not have Javascript enabled at all.</p></div>
