If memory serves me correctly, weren't the 'tailies' that were taken supposed to be the 'good' ones, or some such thing?  I think I remember something like that during the re-cap of the 'tailies' time on the island.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Aye, I don't think "hatch boy" went to the Others.  My other question is; why have such an armory?  Who came first?  The hatch or the Others?  Where the guns to protect "hatch boy" from the Others or from the thing that happens if the timer runs out?</p><p>I'm highly suspect of Libby.  That girl trips me out, even more so with Hurley looking at her for a straight minute, then her defusing the situation with a revealing top.</p><p>I think that Hurley remembers her from the hospital he was in.  Libby was either a patient or a doctor (Duh).  Plus that story she made up about him stepping on her foot was shaaaady.  I have a funny feeling about her...funny feeling I tells ya'!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think we know what "Good" is yet, Biship, in terms of what the Others want. They have taken children for sure. To me - since I think this is all Pyschic related - it may be that children are "Good" since their minds aren't totally formed up yet. Also, and you will see this in the preview for the next episode, I believe the Others grab the Asian girl.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Locke/Heroin - Not sure. Maybe the thought is - save EVERYTHING since you  never know what you will need.</p><p>Locke - question - was it ever explained how he learned all the hunting/military stuff? In his first backstory, if I remember right, he was talking to a coworker about military history, so he could just have been "really into it", but just because you read about guns, knives, etc, doesn't mean you can convert it into real-world use.</p></div>

I just don't remember the foot thing, but I do remember the sweaty/almost missing the plane part.</p><p>Locke/Heroin - Perhaps he's saving it to keep charlie away from the baby in the future?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I clearly remember seeing those washing machines in the first scenes of the inside of the "hatch." I pointed out to my fiancee that they were too new.</p><p>When they mentioned it last night, I wasn't sure if they were poking fun of themselves (for sort of messing up having such new item in the hatch) or if there's more to the issue.</p><p>When a show has so many different theories/twists, it's very easy for a prop on set to cause lots of attention, when in fact the prop used was an oversight and shouldn't have been used.</p><p>So, are they making fun of themselves for making a mistake or does it indeed mean something (i.e. there's people in contact with the island.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think a bad assumption has been made above. That being that we have our survivors and the others as the only people on the island. The "Others" didn't take the good people. The remaining scientists took them. The video tape discussed a "perfect society" so the scientists have worked to create a Utopia. That's why Zeke didn't recognize Ethan as their spy. The Others' spy hasn't been discovered yet. Ethan was a spy for the scientists.</p><p>The Others took Walt. Walt's not good. Walt killed the bird, killed his mother, and burned the raft. Walt may end up being good but right now he is not Utopian good.</p></div>

Also At the bottom Cindy is holding a knapsack and stick (and when climbing). At the top, Libby has it. Contradicting that is that there will be a Libby-centric episode this season.</p></div>
