		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you're correct about db specific questions.  Those probably belong in an Oracle or Postgres cookbook.  I would, however, lean towards publishing FAQs, even if they are somewhat obvious.  If the target audience is beginners, and a question gets asked repeatedly, why not include the answer?  Obviously people are missing something and the cookbook would help them out where the docs/standard books haven't.  Sometimes it's much easier to read in a cookbook format, and sometimes RTFM can be a challenge for a beginner.  My $0.02.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the DB related stuff should be in the cookbook. For myself, seven years ago when I first touched ColdFusion, it was my first taste of SQL. I ended up learning all the basics through I ColdFusion book. If I was a beginner today, I think I would find it helpful. As for the the second question, I think that stuff should be in there as well. I still come across functions and stuff even today, that I never knew existed in the language. So anything to help one, know more detail about a programming lanugage is better than less.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Being as this is a community site, post the question (removing a specific database from the title to make it generic) and allow users to comment about how to write the query with another database.</p><p>Typically, CF developers know one type of database very well.  For instance, I've worked for years with SQL Server, but have only touched Oracle, so I may know how to do something in SQL Server but not know in Oracle.  However, other readers can probably say the opposite.  Our collective knowledge is better than that of one inidividual - the comments would be the perfect place for this, where everyone can share the same type of query for the database that they're most familiar with.</p><p>Plus, in some cookbook answers, it's not really the exact code for the query that matters, but the technique used in the query.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>1) my first inclination was to say "yes...we as CF developers use databases daily, so database related questions (even if they're db specific) should be allowed."  but then i started thinking that along those same lines, we also use HTML, CSS, JS...so in order to keep things managable, i end up leaning towards your inclination of not publishing these types of entries.</p><p>2) i think that almost anything can be solved by reading the docs.  things like the cookbook and other sites are there to complement the docs.  i wouldn't expect to see an entry here that says,</p><p>"Q: how do I trim a variable?  <br>A: use trim()"</p><p>but i -might- expect to see</p><p>"Q: how can I ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces in my variable value?  <br>A: CF provides 3 built in functions to address the issue of leading/trailing spaces in CF ... (on to examples of trim(), ltrim(), and rtrim()...and maybe even explanations of how form fields or database fields can append trailing spaces to a value).</p><p>the latter being more than a simple regurgitation of the docs.</p><p>i'd also suggest that it's better to have the information in too many places than not enough places.</p><p>(sorry this ended up being kinda long) :)</p></div>

But just like the "for Dummies" books have taken off, if a ColdFusion cookbook makes any profit at all, it won't be long before there's a SQL Server cookbook, a mySQL cookbook, an Oracle cookbook, an html cookbook, a js cookbook, etc, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it's easy for us as experienced ColdFusion developers to say a ColdFusion cookbook should only have entries specific to ColdFusion, but in reality the people that will be using this site will not have a lot of programming experience and if you don't show them different ways to interact with different databases in ColdFusion then you will only be doing a disservice to those users.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In general I like being able to come across a problem and find an answer in a centralized place.  However such place realistically can't cater to developers of all levels and all skills.  (refering to charlie's comment about using CSS, JS, et al)  I love the cookbook idea, my problem with it (not this one in general but the concept) is that some assumptions have to be made about a developers abilities.</p><p>So my view is, keep out the db, platform and language problems and focus on Coldfusion.  If it helps &amp;lt;shameless plug&amp;gt; I'm actually working on a site for Coldfusion (and related tech) newbies and relative newcomers.  &amp;lt;/shameless plug&amp;gt;</p><p>-Bish<br>(poster formerly known as Anthony, change to avoid confusion with the Weeg One)</p></div>

I think if the solution requires coldfusion markup to solve, then it should be included in the cookbook.  If the solution just requires sql code, then it shouldn't.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know about anyone else, but any time I've seen the question "How do I retrieve the source of a remote web page?" its always not about the HTML but about the original source code, i.e. the CFML behind the HTML.  The obvious answer is that you can't, you can only get the HTML, unless of course it is an open-source or freely downloadable &amp; unencrypted application.</p><p>As for databases, I suggest allowing the questions to be asked but before publishing the answer to research methods of doing the specific task in different databases and presenting a list of the methods.  Things like "How do I do automatically increasing number columns" i.e. an identity e.g. for a primary key; the answer is one thing in MySQL, something else in PostgreSQL, etc.  You should shy away from disallowing/ignoring questions and focus instead on how to turn too narrowly focused questions into broader answers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond,</p><p>I disagree about the SQL Server issue. I think *some* issues should be published. While this certainly shouldn't be a SQL cookbook by any means, I do think there are certain issues that should be addressed. However, instead of having different questions/answers for each database, I think the attempt should be made to give an answer for the main dbs (SQL Server/Oracle) and then advice on how to approach the problem.</p><p>For example, the one question that constantly shows up on CF-Talk, is the correct way to get the primary key of the record just inserted.</p><p>I think this issue is important enough that it should be covered. There's only one really reliable way to handle this in SQL Server, and it's to use the SCOPE_IDENTITY() function:</p><p>[CFQUERY]<br>insert into [Table] (<br>  column1, <br>  column2<br>) values (<br>  #value1#,<br>  #value2#<br>)</p><p>select SCOPE_IDENTITY() as newId<br>[/CFQUERY]</p><p>In these cases there a very proven techniques that should be used over other solutions. These are the type of SQL questions I think should be addressed. I'd be very selective of the type of SQL questions that do get answered, but I'd at least address some of the very common core issues a developer will face.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I get the feeling that perhaps apples and oranges are in discussion here.  Database related topics should be included, but as they relate to ColdFusion.  We may be lost in the idea of providing syntax for 4-5 major databases and this seems arduous for those that focus on 1-2.  I am all for knowing how to use MS-SQl, MySQL and PL-SQL for a solution, but I think the integration parts should be more focused upon.</p><p>An example would be aliased columns in a CFQUERY tag.  MS-SQL supports many differents ways to create an alias for a record column, but natively inside the CFQUERY there is a more limited choice for Ad-hoc queries.</p><p>Select Foo AS 'Foo_Colum' or Select Foo 'Foo_Column'</p><p>The above examples are acceptable for MS-SQL, but will cause issues with versions of CF.  CF supports rather:</p><p>Select Foo AS Foo_Column</p><p>Foo_Column without single quotes.  I understand that this may be minor and Stored Procs is a better solution, but a SQL newbie may not understand why CF doen't understand the MS-SQl documentation of aliased columns.</p><p>I think the CF exceptions to DB manufacturers should be included, but a complete list of all possible notations in each of the 5 DB's standards for SQL should not be.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Point 1: I think it would be a good idea to include the DB questions.<br>As you mentioned, the target is beginner upwards, and I know when I was a beginner (maybe I still am), knowing the difference between a CF, SQL, HTML, JS or CSS issue/question is very hard, so having a single place to ask is great.<br>I guess more the "whatColdFusionTouches" cookbook. Meaning, ColdFusion interacts with all the before mentioned SQL, HTML etc, so lets give a helping hand to all of them.</p><p>Point 2: Again, if Beginners are the target, is this a location where they can ask questions of more experience CFers with out a roll of the eyes and a "you DON'T know THAT?" look.<br>If so, I'd be inclined to include them. <br>I think linking to the live docs (as you are) is great to. Teach us how to find out ourselves.</p><p>Hope that makes sense...</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>David</p><p>PS: Looking forward to hearing you on CFPodcast!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In counter (and compliment) to the remarks from David above, one of the things that eventually drove me from the Open Source/Linux community (and into the loving arms of the CF world) was the fact that when beginners and newbies asked questions with what seemed like obivious answers people would get rude and down right mean.</p><p>What I'm saying is, if it is decided that 'low-level' questions and answers are going to be added that we take care and effort to guide them to the answer with examples, links and relative comments. Not slam them for bing stupid and tell them to RTFM.  Keep in mind, the manual and by extension the livedocs are written by people who know what they are doing.  They aren't always clear on what is doable, and more important what a taf or function is capable of.</p><p>I can't tell you how many times I have searched thru them to find an answer that isn't there, only to find it via google.  Problem is, you have to know what your asking when you google it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, and by extension, folks,<br>I really like this idea however I would like to see separate databases listed on here.  Why can't you make sub-cookbooks of database specific programming as it pertains to how CF7 interacts with that database?  If you are trying to build up the community wouldn't it be smarter to have people that are smart on those databases helping out by helping you manage their respective sections by posting relevant coding methods, practices, and solutions to problems?  I really like this idea however I see a train-wreck coming if you try to manage it all by yourself.  Delegation is a good thing and I think you would do well to get smart-folks to manage an area (say MSSQL 2k, CF7, &amp; Stored Procedures for instance) who could provide excellent recipes for those who come after them.  There are many out there who I am sure would love to donate some time to this as is evidenced by the amount of submissions you are getting.</p><p>If your goal is just to get a bunch of recipes to print then limit your scope to what you want to include on here since that will be what is available for print and fit in a book.  However, if your goal per your "charter":<br>The purpose of this site is simple - help people solve problems. <br>is the above then it would be worth your time to have these areas established as a reference repository for beginners and experts alike.  I use a lot of online resources to help me program CF7 and feel that it would be much nicer to be able to come to the Coldfusion Cookbook to get an answer versus trying to rephrase my query in google so that my answer will show up in English instead of in my favorite language isolate of Burushaski or some other odd esoteric blog on the internet.</p><p>By the way, thanks for doing such a wonderful bangup job with the Coldfusion Cookbook concept.<br>Tom</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd definitely keep questions like the one in the cfhhtp example, and for a simple reason : alhtough CFDOCS would explain to you how and why to use chttp, it doen't help when you've never heard of the tag and don't know where to start in the first place</p></div>
