		<div class="comment_text"><p>Michael -- it should be pointed out that PHP developers might look at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyspace.com%3AgMR6ysUb5Nci9nFAmv1PalQ47kU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="myspace.com">myspace.com</a>, see that it was written in Coldfusion and declare "I've never seen a site throw more errors -- clearly, Coldfusion is a bad programming platform."</p><p>I think it's pretty obvious that programming languages and methodologies can be used to write some pretty lousy applications, regardless of the strength of the language or platform.  The point is not that it's impossible to write a bad program in Fusebox, but rather that it's really hard (for most people) to write a really good program without a framework, and Fusebox happens to be considered a good one by a great number of great programmers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is just my experience with frameworks and ColdFusion (not including Java), but I worked at one government agency that used Fusebox and it was a nightmare. Talk about shotty code. I think it creates more confusion for the developer. The way CF7 is setup, you really can implement an approach such as MVC without using a framework. Yes it may help keep Jr. developers on the same page, but you pay a price for it. I say let your creative juices flow and skip on the frameworks for CF - you'll become a better programmer in the end.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt; In the future I'd recommend getting all the facts before you post nonsense like that.</p><p>What are you supposed to think when you see ?fuseaction= in the url strings. Of course its heavily modified, its a huge site. The number of problems the site has ( I use it frequently ) .. I attribute it DIRECTLY to the methodology used to create it, which in this case, started with fusebox.</p><p>From what I have seen, I dont think that its allowing that site to scale properly.</p><p>As far as url strings .. your right, they all give lousy ones back for the search engines. I think thats one of the main reasons that I have avoided using any CF framework. Pardon me for saying, but like the last comment - I think "CF" is my framework and I am quite happy to leave it at that. I utilize a lot of cf's advantages and still, even after designing some rather large sites .. havent seen the point. I think it over-complexifies the task at hand in most cases.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt; What are you supposed to think when you see ?fuseaction= in the url strings.</p><p>First point, Fusebox has gone through numerous improvements since version 2 (5+ years old) which is what MySpace started off with. The second point is that they have totally butchered the code themselves.</p><p>&gt; I attribute it DIRECTLY to the methodology used to create it, which in this case, started with fusebox.</p><p>This is just where you're wrong. First, once you modify the core framework code (regardless of the framework), all bets are off. You're on your own, and in that case you can easily introduce problems becuase one thinks they're improving something but in reality they are very likely cuasing more problems. But the most important issue is that the framework is only a way to wire together the layers of your application (controller, model, and view in most cases). It can't stop anyone from writing inefficient code, SQL queries, or anything else. When used well and backed up with well-written code, Fusebox scales to extremely large applications just fine. When coupled with poorly written code, no framework in the world can save you. This is the point that you are missing.</p></div>
