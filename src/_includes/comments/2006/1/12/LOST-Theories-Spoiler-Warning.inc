		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't have a concrete theory on what the "beast" is, but I'm wondering if Eko's religious beliefs had anything to do with his reaction to the smoke (and it to him).</p><p>It isn't long after his encounter with the Beast that he recites "and yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil...".</p><p>For some reason those words really struck me as being relevant to the earlier scene.  The point might be that he was unafraid and thus able to stare it down, or perhaps there is a deeper connection.  I dunno.</p><p>(As an aside, I get so irritated at having to wait a week for the next "fix" that I've considered not watching the show for two or three weeks, and then watching back-to-back recorded episodes.  Anyone else feel the same way? :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not attacking something that shows no fear is a good strategy for whatever it is. If you are fearful you are bound to react irrationally, even violently towards whatever it is. If the beast sees no fear it can relax its guard and study the subject without fear of being attacked.</p></div>

As for Eko, I havent got their yet, but I know that he is deeply religious, and has been compared in sorts to Moses with his staff carved with religious quotes.</p><p>Finally (sorry for the long post), typing in <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Foceanicairlines.com%2F%3Au7niWXFVY8nZ1aP1iDzqasn8Bg0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://oceanicairlines.com/">http://oceanicairlines.com/</a> in your browser directs you to a Google search for Angelus Kaduna, and in particular the following page heading "Angelus, Kaduna (Nigeria), 14 February 1982".

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My theory on lost is that this is all a computer program thats why they must hit that button every 108 mins to keep the computer running. Also Walt must be psychic because he was reading a comic book last season with a polar bear and then he almost got eaten by one. He was talking about the bird in his flashback and the bird died. Or locke hunted birds and sawyer killed a polar bear and charlie killed one of "the others" (ethan) and now walt has been captured by the others.As far as the monster im still figuring that one out they could really go anywhere with that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>With more and more religious symbolism showing up, what if the island is Purgatory? Each of them seems to have either killed someone or done some grave injustice in his or her life. Maybe the "beast" is an instrument of justice that doesn't torment those members who are atoning for their sins - Eco being the most obvious example. That could mean that 4 8 15 16 23 42 could all be bible books, chapters and verses. Just another theory to throw on the pile.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The religious overtones of this show have been apparent from day one, and I think this episode just brought them out even more!  Echo is a priest, and the black smoke didn't touch him....because he is marked by the cross of Christ.  Locke, on the other hand, got dragged by the monster/smoke down towards the center of the ground and kept saying "its my destiny, I'm not afraid."</p><p>Also, the fortune teller told Claire that she had to take care of that baby herself....not give it up for adoption...and that the future thought of that child was the most evil/terrible thing he had ever seen.  (anti-christ child perhaps??)</p><p>And then when Echo and Locke were talking at the table about the movie...</p><p>Everything seems to lead to the fact that Locke is NOT the good man people think he is...but is perhaps the devil/represents the devil, etc. - and Echo is the image of Christ...too much to go into now but, with the smoke staying away from a believer in christ, and dragging locke down to the hole without locke being afraid and claire needing to baptize the baby...makes you wonder...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok,</p><p>I stumbled on this blog, and like most of you am trying to find the "meaning" I suppose.</p><p>Here is what I have come up with, and sorry if this has already been noted:</p><p>First,  The island was inhabited by "Psychologists/psychiatrist" for the purpose of furthering research for Dharma.  This is a presumed, because we have to believe what we are told.</p><p>Second, the characters have all survived a seemingly impossible accident.  This has created a bond among the characters.</p><p>Third, All of the characters have a fairly traumatic past, probably involving therapy and in many cases the indivduals have flashbacked and revealed they have been in therapy (i.e. hugo, Locke, Claire, Lucia,) Others have certainly needed it, Kate, Jack, Sawyer, Eko, Sun, Walt etc.)</p><p>The Others would be the constant pressure that keeps the Lost group on edge and force them to take action when normally they may not.</p><p>So given the knowns, could this be an elaborate group therapy/experiment.  These individuals are all being monitored and tested to see either their responses or their lack thereof.</p><p>Thats my crackpot idea.</p><p>Slings and arrows?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Im not trying to sound like a jerk, but most of these theories seem too vague and rely on the supernatural to confirm them. Ive read a few things about how the writers put certain lines in the plot to kind of poke fun at the people who read way too much into everything. Im not saying thats a fact, but thats just some of the rumors Ive read. I have a feeling that once all the clues are on the table and they start getting into whats actually going on, that a lot of the stuff that everybody thought meant something really didnt mean anything at all. Like all the religious references. I think all that is just the fact that all these people are searching for answers, and when there is something that cant be explained, people turn to religion for the answers and hope.</p><p>The only things Ive figured out, or at least think Ive figured our is who the "the others" are and why Claire remembers scratching Russo.</p><p>I think the others might be the scientists that were supposed either relieve Desmond from his duties in the hatch or they are the scientists that he claimed were there before him. I couldnt tell you why they abandoned the hatch or anything else, thats mostly just a shot in the dark.</p><p>The reason Claire remembers Russo is because she was saved by her from "the others" or Russo is one of "the others"</p><p>I cant remember how old Russos son was when he was kidnapped but maybe Ethan was her son, maybe not if the ages dont match up. Theres just so much lying going on that I cant keep some stories straight.</p></div>

I KNOW I take the show too far, but it's certainly more fun the most of what is on tv. And when you add the fact that the drama is -so- damn good, it really makes the show shine.</p><p>What I find funny is how the networks just don't get that this show ISNT a sci fi show! It's a drama. A good one. Yet they tried to replicate the show will silly clones like Invasion. (Although my son loves Surface.)</p><p>I too think that the Others are related to Dharma. I'm not sure they are other scientists, but I definitely think they were part of Dharma.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dharma used 2 people to live in the hatch for, I think 6 months at a time. They would be responsible for entering the code. I don't think they said what happaned to the other person. Oh - and the guy (Ethan I think), had known the main doctor guy (I always forget his name).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Okay, liked some of the theories above and have to say something(only 'cos gf doesn't wanna know)<br> Firstly, I dont think the island is as far from civilisation as we are led to believe.<br> Secondly, we all know that the characters are emotonally or spiritually lost, but those that were previously taken by the 'others' had one thing in common, and not innocence.It was faith in themselves.all of the main  characters believe that they are beyond redemption and have been looking for anything they could find to forgive themselves.Hence, they are being tested to prove, not on any relgious level,that they are still capable of behaving like human beings toward each other, even in savage circumstances.Or they were all infected before getting on plane and I'm talking sxxt.<br>   Finally,the other's,I believe are military simply monitoring the effects of the disease(related to the executed pilot in Iraq.) which does include the weirdest damn hallucinations and a penchant for being attacked by clouds of guilt.<br>  Sorry for length, <br> ciao</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll have to agree with "The Real Sawyer", turning to religion as an awswer to something that "can't" be explain scientifically is the first thing people do. The clouds of smoke are real, the sound of the beast is real, ... now one question... are the images that Eco sees a masterpiece of the beast? In my opinion, no, simply because it makes the beast a dark magical thing, and that simply doesn't coup with the story that is being telled, in my perspective things that seem irational, like the images that Eco sees, have to be something that can be explain trought the mind of the character , it's all in his head folks, maybe if you stop to see that, just maybe some characters are beginning to be infected by the disease, some of the irational things that they see or listen can be explain. Like Jack says "it's all a mind game", and in fact it is, Locke and Eco are deeply religious guys, and they sometimes see what their mind wants to see and not what's actually happening.<br> In my opinion Jack is the only character as an notable doctor he was, that tries to put a question mark in every irational thing that happens on the island.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have read "Prey" by Michael Crichton which deals with bio-engineered self-replicating nanobots.  The 'bots band together to become replicas of the characters and to hunt.  When the characters first come in contact with the cloud, if they did not run, the bots become confused.  Only if they ran were they killed.</p><p>The "smoke" has the ability to enter and explode from the ground, so there is substance to the cloud. I don't think there is any spiritual connection to the cloud.</p><p>Other posters have mentioned that each person has something in his past which he needs to atone for.  What does Sun have?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Addressing the theories regarding the smoke / beast being conjured in different characters minds, lets not forget that many of the characters have heard or seen the beast in groups.  In episode 2 a group heard it and actually saw it knock down trees.  When Locke was being dragged, Jack was present.  Why would a stick of dynamite affect a symbol or a spirit??  What killed the pilot?  But most important and frustrating is why do survivors continue to go into the woods alone if they truly beleive that there is a terrorizing monster out there?  Not consistent!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i think that the island is purgatory for the sinners and the "others" are angels or demons depending on how you perceive them. Kind of like Jacob's Ladder the movie. The survivors have to atone for their sins before they can move on. The boy got taken after it seemed as though he had forgiven his dad for not being there for him. The cloud monster is a combination of their sins.Eco fears not his sins same as locke who is willing to accept his fate for whatever he has done(lost faith in God?)          what do you think of my idea?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If we go the Biblical or Religous route, any theory is possible.  I think faith in general plays a small part in the whole picture.  The relevance of faith, God and destiny are sprinkled throughout to make for good dramatic episodes.  Overall, I think the Dharma initiative is the key.  The symbol was on the plane fuselage, it was on the shark that chased Sawyer, it is in the hatches.  Answer why a woman who sends out a distress signal for 16 years chooses to remain isolated.  Why a group of others who have a working boat refuse to leave the island. Where a man (Desmond)who believes the world will end if the button is not pushed ran off to; thinking he would be safe???  How does the actors glue and fake beard come into play?  Why would all the hatches be stockpiled with weapons? Why would a film explaining the Dharma Initiative be found INSIDE the hatch??  Wouldnt anyone placed in the hatch already know why they were there?  Or the island for that matter??</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tony, some of your questions have already been answered. Why did the woman stay isolated? Remember - she believes there is a disease on the island. It infected her friends. Why do a group of others refuse to leave the island even though they have a boat? The last episode answered that. The Others are Dharma employees in disguise.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond: This is not consistent.  If she thought the survivors had the disease then why not do what she did to her crew and kill them.  Or, why does she seek them out occasionally.  When she thought Claires baby was sick, she acted as if she knew there existed a cure.  This woman may not be who we think she is.  She led Claire and Kate to the hatch where the doctors( Ethan ) did experiments, but once they got there, she stood in the backround while the survivors searched the premises and eventually found the fake beard.  It's as if she wanted that to happen. Season 1 she was terrified of the others (notice she always has her weapon), but then she captures a stranger who she claims is an other and turns him over to Syaid and Locke?? When she captured Syaid, she tortured and questioned him herself!!!  What do you make of the end of the last episode where the prisoner referred to Lockes past?  Somewhat instigating a division between him and the doctor?  Could he have been purposely planted by the french woman?  Perhaps she is the puppetmaster?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think they gave you a small piece of the puzzle by what "Dave" told Hurley.  What Dave said was partially true about it being in Hurleys head.  I believe that "most" of the survivors are in mental institutions.  Possibly several or the same, but with the virtual reality theory it doesn't much matter.  We already know that the girl that likes him was.  I think the darhma guys are the doctors.  They are trying to control and stimulate patients in a psych ward for the purpose of making them better.  It's like group therapy without the walls of the hospital.  They medicate these patients with a mind controlling drug to make the feel like they are on a trapped island together.  The medication is experimental.  It's sort of like the Matrix.</p><p>Now I said "most" are in an institiion, because some of the survivors are not real.  They are put there to test the patients or to help with their recovery. The one women needed her husband to come to help her recovery so he was a survivor from the tail end of the plane.  I believe he's not really a patient, just like Dave and Jacks father, and Walt (I'll get to that).</p><p>The island is a closed area that they can't leave.. the hospital.  The others are doctors who appear sinister, but have their best interest in mind, as most mental patients will tell you of their doctors.</p><p>They tried before the crash with the French womens group and the meds didn't work.  She was the only survivor.  Hurley was the next test subject and was given a positive alternate reality where he won the lottery.  He was tested when terrible things were happening around him to people he cared about.  This was to help him deal with the porch collapsing.  While he was in this other Lost survivors were checking into mental institutions as well.  They were linked together and as they get better they will die off.  I believe Boons sister stopped being selfish and learned her lesson, so she was gone.</p><p>Each person must face there fears and what put them there.  Jack saw his father, the musician found drugs, Sieed? had to face his torture and make a decision, Walt got taken leaving the father to have to deal with abandonment issues, hurley has to deal with food addiction, echo had to deal with the drug plane, the australian girl had to deal with the loss of her child, etc. etc.  Certain things had put them in the mental institution and the are LOST.  The pregnant girl went to LA gave up her child and freaked.  Jack went to his fathers funeral and freaked, etc. etc.</p><p>The back story of each "real" survivor will lead to one place and that is a mental institution.  The doctors had to give them each a setup to get them on the plane and on the island.  However none of it is real.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe the button is the time they have to take their medication to stay in this reality.  Every 108 minutes or something.  The numbers are also something from the hospital, like the drugs serial number or a phone number 1 (4 8 1)5 16 -23 42 or 1(481)516-2342.</p><p>Just a theory but I think I got it. What do you think?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What if the "monster" and "the button" are related. Think about what happend in Lockdown.</p><p>While Locke was trapped under the door the alarm started to sound, right.</p><p>Now, the so called "survivor" gets into the computer room.</p><p>Some freaky florescent lights pop on and reveal a map to Locke with (I think 5-7) dharma compounds on it.</p><p>The so called survivor apparently enters the code.</p><p>The alarm stops, doors raise up, and everythings okie dokie.</p><p>Later on the now, fake survivor says he nevered entered the code. The timer ran out, he saw the egyptian symbols(like before), heared "something magnetic" and then the timer reset. What if, when the timer goes out it trigers the big electro magnet and activated the "monster". If there are other bases out on the island with no one supervising them, thats about 5-7 other alarms going off every 108 minutes.</p><p>Just a theory, but I think I'm close.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that the black smog is a thing that reads peoples minds and finds out things about thier past's to use it against them. for instance season 2 episode 10 (ecko's past)when ecko confronts the thing the camera goes inside the smog and if you pause it you see a church and a statue of the mother mary these things are a big part of ecko's past<br>also on ecko's stick he writes down bible refrences maybe this has some clue about what is going on.</p></div>

Dharma are building this weapon too subjew(spelling?) other super powers in the world(ie. terrorists, america, etc). This weapon has the power to control one's mind to some extend, and control of objects, like a car or a mechanical machine.</p><p>the constuction of this weapon has taken many yrs, so many that the scientsists themselves need replacing. and that is where our 'lost' come into this picture. They all have some how or way made there selves on to the airplane that crashed(with the help from the weapon). They have bn selected by the scientists to replace them.</p><p>i believe the plane did not in fact crash but was planted there, and the 'lost' waken from there slumber. In the first episode u can see wat appears to b smoke, but wat it is, are small metal fragments.</p><p>the polar bear and shark are robotts controled by the weapon. Walt will gain physic powers, but atm the weapon is helping him along. like wen he threw the knife at the tree, it stuck in perfect.</p><p>the sounds in the forest are projected by the weapon, the images of walt are also project.</p><p>the 'lost' are controled by the waepon and it is moulding them as it wants to.</p><p>oh yeah and the weapon has shifted earth's magnetic field, ultimating sending the world's technology back centuries and thus, no one has found them</p><p>and yeah, watever, thats just wat i think, and i can b bothered putting any more. there is probaly more that i havent put down.. i nose its not very good, but im just throwing ideas around.</p><p>stephen</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My theory on LOST is that the Island was once used as an Animal Testing Facility, that explains the Polar Bears and the Logo thats printed on the Sharks Fin. If you look at the food containers in the hatch where Kate was locked all of the containers have the same logo printed on them. The reason they have to enter the numbers every 108 minutes (which is actaully the sum of 4,8,15,16,23,42) is because of an Electro Magnetic Pulse that has been naturally developed on the Island, that explains why the plane(s) and the boats crashed onto the island. This EMP was not planned when the Facility was used for animals, that explains why the place was abandonned. Also Desmond spoke of an infection and people dying and falling sick. Thats why the inside of the hatch door had 'QUARINTINE' Printed on it. My guess is that the animals developed some kind of disease that the scientists (that may have worked on the island before) couldn't cure. That may be another explaination for why the island was practically desserted. But I also have one more theory, what if this was all a dream, developed by the panic of the plane supposibly hitting turbulance. When they hit the turbulance the oxygen maskes were dropped, but what if the pressure knocked them all out and put them into a dream, then the plane split (in their dream) but when the oxygen is restored to the cabin they wake up in the plane again. This explains the weird things that happen e.g. Lockes legs, the 'mechanical' pillar of smoke etc. This could just be their minds trying to work out an explination for this dream, or it could be a warning or maybe it could be their punishment for their sins. It could also be a test, they could have died on the plane and they are in a place between heaven and hell and depending on their actions in this 'test' determines which way they go. (like a second chance).</p><p>Please comment on my theorys as I would love to hear from you. E-Mail me... :D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, not sure if anyone else picked this up or not, but if you add all the numbers together, they equal 108, which is the amount of time they have to reset the button/timer each time.  Trivial, but interesting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i think that the island is one big psychology experiment... let me try and explain... someone posted that the people on the island have had traumatic pasts.... there's my theory... if these people are on the island as some type of scientific investigation to study the reform of traumatized people then that would make some sense.... eko reformed.... charlie kinda did.... jack got over aspects of his life.... loads have characters have reformed someway.... however i still like the idea that the island is just an experiment gone wrong...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would like to say something about the Pearl or the ?. Locke and Eko believe they have found the question mark at the pearl, the pearl is infact the question mark. But i think different. If u look at the huge drawing on the blast door locke saw the pearl is mentioned. It reads:</p><p>CV IV?<br>THE PEARL?</p><p>On the map, there is something labelled CV IV, what it is, I am not sure but it is labelled and it isnt near the ?.</p><p>I therefore believe that Locke and Eko have not yet found the mystery? I would appreciate other speculations people have about this because the whole LOST and it's series of unanswered questions is driving me mad!!!!!!!It is still, quite brilliant!!!!! I love it !!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree somewhat with Robert in that the aerial view that Ekko saw of the site where his brother's plane landed when it fell looked like it had another circle salted into the ground. It looked more like a disjointed figure 8. And the monitoring station called "The Pearl" seemed to be an awfully small chamber to take up all of that space on the valley floor. Could it be that they didn't fully explore?</p><p>On an unrelated note, I was intrigued by the story Ekko told Michael about the boy who asked about hell back in Nigeria. The punchline to the story - that he was not interested in forgiveness, but afraid that dog would be waiting for him in hell - almost implied that Ekko might have had some insight to Michael's guilt.</p><p>Did anyone happen to catch what Dharma symbol was on the hatch at "The Others'" camp? I meant to check it out on my DVR, but haven't yet had a chance. What's the scoop?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This may be a bit of a cliche theory,<br>But I absolutely 100% think that the entire show is based on purgatory.<br>Locke's leg is healed, Sun is pregnant, Rose no longer has cancer, it all fits.<br>Everybody's injuries have been healed so as to begin the process of resolving other problems dealt with in the characters' lives.<br>I think every time somebody dies, it's simply because they have either resolved their problem, or are going to hell. Also, Henry, the man in the hatch.. or.. who WAS in the hatch, says that the bearded man is absolutely nothing, and that the man REALLY in charge is a powerful man; God, perhaps. I could elaborate on my theory, but you may be able to figure it all out yourselves (Black and white themes throughout the whole show i.e. Black horse, white polar bear. The white and black stones found in the dead person's pocket, the backgammon pieces used in Locke's game.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I live in the uk and watch LOST, and I have developed a theory (it's still not complete but i'll give an outline).</p><p>Firstly, the 'others' are exactly what they claim to be, the good guys. They were the original test participants of a psychological experiment by Dharma, which stopped many years ago, yet they could not manage to leave the island.</p><p>The others are doing exactly what the survivors are doing, trying to unlock the island's secrets and get home. You will probably agree that there is a lot of religious symbolism in the series, which lead me to believe that the others are waiting for some sort of prophesised messiah, which will lead them off the island. That's why they kidnap only people that they think may have potential, e.g. Walt, Claire's baby, Danielle's baby, and Locke (Henry says they were planning to take Locke before he escapes).</p><p>This explains why they only attack when necessary, and why they dropped off food for the survivors (to ensure they stay safe). The others are not evil and were originally as clueless as the survivors, yet they have discovered more about the island then them. In the final season I predict that the others and the survivors will work together, and unlock the secret of how to escape the island.</p><p>I think this theory is more plausible that others e.g. purgatory, because they are very obvious explanations so are unlikely to be true, because there would be no suprise at the final season if the explanation is obvious.</p><p>Furthermore, theories such as electromagnetism seem to be logical, but the science behind it is more complicated than what the average viewer would be able to comprehend, and still find entertaining. LOST is a drama series full of twists and turns in the plot, so the answer behind the island is likely to be the biggest twist of all, which I think will be that the others are not evil (a theme developed throughout season 1 and 2).</p><p>Thats about it... tell me what you think.</p><p>This is my first draft and is likely to be flawed so any suggestions on how to improve it are welcome.</p><p>mail me at omar_shahien@hotmail.com</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm in the U.K and have only seen up to episode 16 so far but there seems to be a running theme of children in this season.  Claires' baby, Sun's pregnant, Walt. Rousso's child, Jack not wanting a child, Sawyer's traumatic childhood experience, Charlie and his brother's baby. All of which seem to have made them the way they are. I can't work out the reasons behind it but every episode seems to point towards children. Is it just me?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I believe there is some kind of virus on the island in season 1 Rosseau (french Chick)said the others must of been carriers and her team caught a virus and died then desmond said about are you infected and had a vaccine. Check this out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdnorton.wordpress.com%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Flost-map-say-whaaa%2F%3AJOJVwzSMIlXZljeea1g02gWhNhU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dnorton.wordpress.com/2006/03/31/lost-map-say-whaaa/">http://dnorton.wordpress.co...</a><br>as it shows a map the Hanso foundation (Dharma) had different hatches and if you go on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehansofoundation.org%3AuFEuOPSAJHSXNzQEsYPfFyBv31w&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.thehansofoundation.org">www.thehansofoundation.org</a> your will see how they did experiments on how to improve humans and eliminate disease to eliminate disease you need it on the map one of the hatches is crossed out is that the incident? a virus escaped and has plaged people there. One weird thing is the bottles of vaccines that desmond had had the numbers on    4 8 15 16 23 42 weird huh ? so don't you think the button may have something to do with that maybe it makes a shield to stop the virus escaping ? I don't know but everything going on has to have something to do with this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>ok spoiler so look away if you do not want to know. <br>Right the film say that they are working on a electromagnetic station on this island know as station 3 the white swan. There are four other stations like the red arrow the one where the tail section survivours hold up and SPOILER the pearl which is station 5 used to monitor the behavior of the station's workers plus when the black cloud comes face to face with Mr. EKO the camera passes through it and we see loads of electricity passing about. so i reckon when the timer reaches zero in the hatch some electromagnetic runoff is released and some physic or more believeable a radio wave animated it and limited its boundaries. Remember the signal they picked up on Sayids walkie talkie and shannon translated. it had to come form some where. Plus i think that dude on the film is in the station 5 the pearl and is monitoring them but will not let them leave because when sawyer jin and micheal + walt where attacked the dharma sign was on the boat and tattooed on the bearded guys arm who took walt. plus it was printed on the sharks tail that  tried to take a bite outta sawyer. thank you</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It seems to me that the smoke obviously has something to do with your past, but is also is the ultimate judge, and quite possibly the "shadow of death."  Though Eko saw horrifying images of his past full of killing and wrong doing, Locke said he saw somehting much different, a bright light that was "beautiful."  Almost as if one was going to go one way after death, and the other the other way at that moment in time.</p><p>Also, could the Island be some sort of Garden of Eden?  Is it just me or did it seem very bright and almost holy when Eko was going after his brother to confess.  It seemed to me that everything got much more colourful.  That and the fact that no one knows where the island is leads me to believe it is some sort of "Eden."</p></div>
