		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was talking with Rob in IM and he asked about the computer. This gave me a thought. Why did Dharma require people to enter the numbers? Why did Dharma tell them not to use the PC to communicate?</p><p>Dharma knows it screwed up. The computer someone how keeps the Lost "stuck" in the other place. Hence the need to keep entering info. (Although why not just have a scheduled task I do not know. ;)</p><p>As for talking - Dharma knows the Others are fighting to get he Lost back and they do not want the person in the hatch to be swayed by them. In other words - do your job and nothing more, period.</p><p>So now we have 4 groups: The people who crashed (they were two groups, now one), the Others, the Lost, and Dharma. Dharma being the ruthless corp trying to cover it's tracks with the failed expirement.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In fact, didn't Other's leader "Zeke" tell Jack something to the effect of "you don't go into someones house and start busting into rooms you're not supposed to be in", which I took as a direct reference to breaking into the hatch. If the hatch were keeping the "Lost Souls" away, wouldn't the Others actually be happy that someone broke into it, increasing their chances of saving them?</p><p>I think the show's writers must love watching all the speculation.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dharma means the study to help us find happiness within ourselfs. The real source of happiness must lie within the mind. There is such a thing called the Dharma wheel. It's essential authenticity is ensured through the continuation of an unbroken lineage of realized practitioners. All of "lost" all have a story and are suffering.  They need to work things out in their minds to become truely happy with themselfs. Even Walt was suffering from the loss of his mother and not knowing his real dad.... Maybe he found happiness and forgave his father when the two met up again..... That's why he was taken... He didn't belong there anylonger.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like Linda's theory about each of the survivors having to work through something tough....it was what I originally thought. But about Walt being taken, there was a comment made by one of the others in the episode "the other 48 days". They find a list of people that they are planning to take and when questioned about the people on the list, as to why there were some not on the list, 'The other' responds, they are not good people. So there is some form of method to the "Others" madness of kidnapping and murdering.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Who have the Others murder? The monster took the pilot but no one else so that could have been an early plot mistake on the writer's part, an accident, or a fluke. When Ethan was around an extra died on the beach while everyone slept but for all we know that was Rousseau or Locke trying to invoke panic. It certainly looked like they were trying to kill Charlie but he lived. Our boaters lived. The only deaths I can identify with any certainty have all fallen on our survivors hands.</p></div>

That is what was said in the first episode.</p><p>Nevertheless, the experiement is real possibility as portrayed in the series.
