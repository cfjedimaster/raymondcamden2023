		<div class="comment_text"><p>I never really got into the show... but then I saw it on the iTunes Music Store just before Christmas, so I bought and watched the mini-series. I then immediately bought and downloaded all season 1 and the first half of season 2... three days later I had finished watching them all and am hooked! Awesome series!</p></div>
