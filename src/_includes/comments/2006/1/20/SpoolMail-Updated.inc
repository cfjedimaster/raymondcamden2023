		<div class="comment_text"><p>CF7 will use App.cfc, however, I don't want to maintain two files. It is too easy to screw it up, know what I mean? And t o properly test I'd need to keep renaming the cfc to hide it. Too much hassle. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>/agree on the pimpslap needs JJ, that guy has really got a hair up somwhere...  He is making himself look stupid saying 'Ray didnt answer the question about his own blog'  Ray DID answer the question - use the native SQL drivers.  And I am sorry, but if the Rabid guy cant explain to his customers the difference in speed and security they can realize using native mode SQL drivers, he might want to look for a new career.  You cant just code, you have to sell best practices to the customer, even when its more difficult or more expensive.  Otherwise, its egg on your face when your app gets SQL injected.</p></div>
