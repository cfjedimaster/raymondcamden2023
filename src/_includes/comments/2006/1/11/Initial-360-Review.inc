		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray- You can use the custom soundtrack feature without copying the tunes to the 360.  Plug in the MP3 player to the 360's USB port and with the game started, click the "Guide" button.  From there select the playlist or play all songs from the audio menu.  Another cool thing is you can chat to someone doing different things i.e. playing different games, watching movies, etc.  My gamertag is RichAlot if you want to add me to your friend list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, you should be able to stream it via an XP computer (don't need media center).  It asks you the location you want to use for the music, I only mentioned MP3 player in my example b/c it's what I use since I haven't had the time to clean up my music's IDE tags on my hard drive.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just got Dead Or Alive 4 this week.  I'm not typically a fan of fighting games....but I could play this game for hours simply to marvel at how beautiful it is.  If this is a first gen game I can't wait to see what developers are going to be doing on the 360 a year or two from now.  DOA 4 is stunning in every way.  And playing online is incredible.</p><p>I haven't done the custom soundtrack thing yet, but I totally love the slideshow feature... it's so great for showing pictures to a group of people.</p><p>Oh and get an HD TV.  I bought the cheapest I could find, a Toshiba CRT, that is capable of 720p.  The crispness of the graphics is unlike anything I've seen before.</p><p>I've all but abandon playing games on my PC except for stuff like Age of Empires III and Civ IV.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm very pro-HD. At the same time - I feel like this is a chaotic time for TVs - and if I wait a few years, not only will the prices come down, but the technology will settle down a bit. I _love_ HD and trust me, I'd put in a 90 inch TV if my wife would let me, but I just want to wait a little bit longer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt; imagine my surprise when COD2 looked better than the PC version!<br>&gt; The load times were about ten times faster than the PC version.</p><p>Yes, there are many Activision "hate" sites out there now because of this.  The reason is because this game was designed for the Xbox 360 and then the PC version was an afterthought.  There are so many bugs and problems with the PC version (even though many PC's hardware are far superior to the 360's hardware and video card).  There was even an internet strike on December 17, 2005 where COD2 server admins shut down there servers in protest of Activision's lack of support or response to the COD2 gaming community's cries for help.</p><p>Me? I just played a different game that day :)</p></div>
