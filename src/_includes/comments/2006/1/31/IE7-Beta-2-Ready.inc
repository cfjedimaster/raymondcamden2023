		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not a MS hater in any way, but Amen! "...the software should not be used on production systems in mission-critical environments..."  Translation: if you plan on using this, don't bother until it's out of beta and then give us a few months to work out the bugs. Another reason I'll stick with Firefox.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oi, a warning... When I installed beta 1 of IE I was never able to open a website in IE (any version) by typing in the address bar.  I always had to use bookmarks (browser or <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%3ATFCVT1TLM3gIVvhu7UvDqoNlAOY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>) to load a site.</p><p>Even *after* uninstalling IE7.  Oh the wonders of modern technology.  Yes, I am aware it's beta, but you'd think they would at least not break their *own* products.  I can see them screwing up Firefox "by accident" but IE itself?  Wild.</p><p>As always, your mileage may vary...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I am using it now, and for what its worth I like it.  Loads almost instantly (my one beef with Firefox as it has gotten older is that it takes longer to load), tabs are well implemented and use the same keyboard shortcuts, and the RSS reader is semi-nice.  Using 28 megs of ram right now with 4 tabs open, and I have been using it all day without a crash so far on a fully patched XP SP2 machine w/ 1 gig of ram.  The 'Expose' like feature for viewing all your tabs is kinda cool too.  Overall I have not seen anything *new*, just copied from other programs, but it was all copied well =)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree completely with your versioning comments.</p><p>I ran Beta 1 as well. It performed ok, no mind-blowingly new features, MS is playing catch-up with the rest of the players in the field after years of adding nothing.</p><p>AFAIK they didn't make too many changes to the rendering engine, most CSS that didn't render right in 6 won't be any better in 7.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with you Ray, Why can they not just put it side by side? a point for me is that I use hotmail, not only that, but i'm using their new fangled Live Mail version that heavily relies on AJAX and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>Well the problem is in IE7 that site doesn't work at all, and so I now have a default browser that won't run on hotmail, so i have to resort to FireFox which shows an ugly version, at least it works though.</p><p>D'oh microsoft, D'oh!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recently installed IE7 Beta and had a play.  After about and hour i decided to uninstall it and drop back to IE6... Sounds simple!</p><p>Everything seemed to go well until i fired up IE6.  Whenever i enter a URL in the address bar of a search term in Google's home page IE decides to open a new tab in Firefox! I cannot view any websites in IE6 anymore.  In one way this is kind of cool but image if you didn't have another browser installed... Would it open Notepad?</p><p>If anyone have had a similar experience and knows of how to fix it, please drop me a line...</p><p>Cheers,<br>Rich</p></div>
