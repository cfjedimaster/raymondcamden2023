		<div class="comment_text"><p>I believe it is still up in the air - so it will be Star Wars and LOST. Seriously - I think Brian said there wasnt a clear thing - but he persoally was interested in MG. So I'm bringing some MG code. Not that I'm expert at it yet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good, I'm curoious about MG myself.  Still haven't had the time to dig into it yet so I'm quite a bit fuzzy on parts but that will come.</p><p>As for LOST, I've decided to stop watching, record all the shows and watch them all back-to-back at the end of the season.  This waiting a week between thing is killing me (24 isn't helping either... ARGH!)</p></div>
