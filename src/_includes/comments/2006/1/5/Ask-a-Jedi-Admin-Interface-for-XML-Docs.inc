		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have in my XML config file around 30 values now and I've been thinking about writing some code that would automatically  create this form so that I wouldn't have to be updated when there is need for new configuration item.</p><p>Never took the time to do it though (or more like that client never asked for it so they wouldn't pay for it either).</p><p>Good thing is that it would be reusable as well.</p><p>Any thoughts about this approach?</p></div>
