		<div class="comment_text"><p>I gotta be honest...there's not much in there as compared to the letter that was apparently sent to Team Macromedia members that made it into the blogosphere. It's great that the higher-ups recognize the community, but I'm more anxious for the investor meeting that's coming up. That's where the real roadmap will be layed out. Coming out of that meeting is where I see the real future of the Macromedia community and its integration with Adobe being cleared up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>January 31 is the date to circle on your calendar. That's the date of the investor meeting where Adobe will outline their strategy and unveil roadmaps for the appropriate products. Anything before then is just PR to let us know they're there.</p></div>
