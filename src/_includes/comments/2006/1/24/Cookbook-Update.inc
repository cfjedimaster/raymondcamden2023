		<div class="comment_text"><p>The link to livedocs is a great feature.  Is it worth while to show what versions that a tag is compatible with?  I have clients that use 5.0, MX and MX7.  I understand the differences and I often program for different environments.  Is it within the scope of the Cookbook for deprecation, versioning or new features?</p></div>
