		<div class="comment_text"><p>I try to avoid doctors at all costs and tough it out :)</p><p>Three years ago I decided to go sled riding at night, face first down a dark hill on a wicked fast inner tube.  And then I hit a ramp that some kids must have built on the hill, which catapulted me across the sky and made for a very uncomfortable landing.  Thus was my introduction to rotator cuff injury.</p><p>When I held my arm straight sideways, parallel to the floor, and then rotated my arm as if I were turning a door knob excrutiating pains shot up my arm.  I spent a lot of time on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebmd.com%3ALQvIy5LaAm-z6-q94w6pCH94w5A&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="webmd.com">webmd.com</a> and such places, trying to assess whether or not I might need surgery.  I read about some gentle exercises that could be done as therapy.</p><p>Six months later, the injury had begun to heal, and I could actually do a pushup or turn a door knob.  Six more months it was entirely healed, and now I have no problems with it at all.  Of course I stopped sled riding at night though.</p><p>Hang in there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For some reason the title gave me a flashback to the cult favorite Evil Dead II.  In it he chopped off his hand because it had become possesed and was trying to kill him.  After he did it was still trying to attack him so he trapped it with a bucket.  He then put a stack of books on top to hold it down.  You can imagine which book was sitting on top.</p><p>Hope it doesn't get that serious Ray! :D</p></div>
