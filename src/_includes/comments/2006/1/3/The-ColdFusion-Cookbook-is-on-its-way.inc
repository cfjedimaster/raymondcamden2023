		<div class="comment_text"><p>See, when I think of cookbook I'm thinking actual pieces of a website like "How do I use CF to validate a password?". This would seperate it from the other books. As your explaining how to code in checks to make sure a password contains special characters, no spaces, etc you can introduce concepts like functions, structures, forms, etc... and at the end idea is to end each chapter with code samples from your blogCFC, galleon, lighthouse, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>FYI,</p><p>I bought a book about two months ago called "Coldfusion MX Develper's Cookbook", it was written by Peter Freitag and Brad Leupen and Chris Reeves.  I really is a very helpful book as it does just what you propose: pose a question, answer with code, describe what the code does and why.</p><p>Maybe you could contact the authors or publisher about using the book's content as starter material.  That way, from the beginning you would have really good content.</p><p>I would bet the book doen't sell as many copies as it once did (although you can get it at Amazon and I highly reccommend it).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's the outline for the original ColdFusion Cookbook we were doing for O'Reilly.  Obviously, this was pre CFMX 7, so there's surely more that could be covered.  The format follows what's in all of their other popular cookbooks (Java, Perl, etc.):</p><p>1	Strings and Lists<br>2	Numbers<br>3	Dates and Times<br>4	Arrays<br>5	Structures<br>6	Queries<br>7	Variables<br>8	Web Application Basics (app design, flow, error/exception, etc)<br>9	Regular Expressions<br>10	Working with Forms<br>11	Databases<br>12	Output Techniques<br>13	Internationalization and Localization<br>14	Files and Directories<br>15	XML and WDDX<br>16	Full Text Indexing and Searching with Verity<br>17	Charting, Graphing and Reporting<br>18	Security<br>19	User-Defined Functions<br>20	Custom Tags<br>21	ColdFusion Components<br>22	Web Services<br>23	Internet Protocols (mail, ftp, http, ldap)<br>24	Caching<br>25	Integrating CF and JavaScript<br>26	Integrating CF and Java<br>27	Integrating CF and COM/.Net<br>28	Integrating CF and Flash MX<br>29	Design Patterns</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>a couple of suggestions,</p><p>If you haven't already thought of it, I would recommend making this a wiki. The biggest problem I have with most of the technical help sites out there is the false or wrong information they contain and then not being able to correct it. These site sort of remind me of searching through usenet to find a solution.</p><p>I would put all a list of all of the tags, functions, etc that the article uses at the bottom of the article, or on the side. This makes it easy to reference and also makes a great check list if you are entering an article about a concept.</p></div>
