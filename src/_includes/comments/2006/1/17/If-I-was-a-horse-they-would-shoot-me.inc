		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Sorry to say this, but you are an idiot. Don't you know that that is a TEXTBOOK sign of a heart attack. Do yourself the favor and read some medical journals once in awhile. You were LUCKY that it was a strain in your rotator cuff, LUCKY!!!! This is the classic example of people being embarrassed and unwilling to pay copays to get medical attention. What you just did in your post is tell the world that your life isn't worth a $100 dollars, because you had to think about it. Next time, I hope you'll get yourself to a doctor first and debate about the money after. When it comes to your health, there is no price.</p><p>Now that I yelled at you, let me offer you some advice... start streching a couple minutes every hour you are on the computer. Esspecially strech you back and arms. Rotate your shoulders and wrists every 30 minutes. Also do eye excerises to prevent headaches and eyestrain.</p><p>We'er all programmers here but that doesn't mean that we have to fit the sterotype of wearing glasses, having CTS and being as fat as pigs.</p><p>BTW, sorry for calling you an idiot. I've had many friends over the years pass away because they did exactly what you did, wait to get medical attention.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wrecked my shoulder last year snowboarding, and one of the issues was that I severely bruised all the tendons and muscles that make up the rotator cuff (the rotator cuff is really a group of tendons and muscles, not just one). I, too, was in a sling for six weeks and I can feel your pain, both literally and figuratively. It's amazing how much goes in to lifting your arm and what losing that ability can do! Anyway, enjoy the drugs and take your time getting back (if you can). Aggravating the cuff (which I did) will only set you back even more.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think we may have the same problem. Except I didn't bother with the sling, just took a couple days off work and rested it.  I blamed it on the way I sit in my computer chair.  I lean to my left quite a bit on arm rests, in addition to the soccer I played and some weight lifting, my shoulder was a MESS a couple of weekends ago.  I am almost positive I weakened my shoulder by leaning on it too much.  Incidentely, I had just played a week straight of CIV IV, and was of course leaning on that shoulder for 1 week straight ... and it has brought me to now: always feeling like I have an incredibly weak shoulder.  Bad posture sucks.  Hope you get better.</p></div>
