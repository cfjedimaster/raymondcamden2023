		<div class="comment_text"><p>I dunno -- I was looking on Amazon, and it seems you'd be hard-pressed to find many movies you'd actually want to watch for less than $9.99 on DVD there.</p><p>I think the real question is the quality -- will people be OK with not having "DVD Quality" at those prices.  Seems the success they have had with TV shows might point to: yes.  I don't think the audience for these is those with really nice home theaters anyway.</p><p>Given how little Apple makes on their music sales, I suspect these price points are driven almost entirely by the cost from the studios, so there's not much they could do about it even if they wanted to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the problem is that the media companies are too greedy and want the downloable movie market to die so we'll all be good consumers and spend $10 on a movie ticket instead.  Then you have to compare prices - $10-15 gets you on average 2 hours of entertainment in a movie versus potentially 4-7 hours of TV content (or 16 episodes of The Daily Show).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Trust me, it is Movie Studios making the money. I worked at a small 7 screen theater for several years. If it was not for the over priced pop corn and soda, there would be no such thing as a movie theater.</p><p>The Movie Studios often take all of (Or a very high 80-90%) the money from the box office (What you pay for admission) for the first two weeks of a new release the. Then the third week they take ~75-80% of the box office. The percentages change based of how "hot" the movie is and what the movie studios think they can get away with. (Oh, and from time to time, a big move Movie Studio may demand that the movie theater pay $3000+ up front just to get a big movie or add a back end charge on if your movie theater did really really well on a movie.)</p><p>So if you break that down, for a 200 seat theater 200 * $9 = $1800. $1800 - 85% = $270 So for a sold out show, the theater only makes $270 of Box office income. And, don't forget they have to pay the staff, electricity, etc.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, selling 130 - $6 popcorns to that full house will probably go a long ways to paying the bills. The movie theaters just don't rake in the money like it looks like they do.</p></div>

But I'm with you on this one</p><p>ALTHOUGH</p><p>I think this is leading up to something bigger... the iTV they previewed this morning showed movies running in HD. So.. what if they keep this pricing structure after they start selling 1080p movies (HDDVD and Bluray quality) to a set top box in your living room. You don't need to worry about the HDDVD/BLURAY war, you can just download it and watch it that way.</p><p>Just my 2 cents..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm.  Napkin math time.</p><p>Presuming H.264 or MP4 compression, combined with the 640x480 size, you're looking at needing around 1.0-1.2Mbps for "DVD Quality".  (Really, it'd be more like "Satellite TV Quality" unless they're really spending money for a good compressor, but I digress.)  You can then go two ways with this:</p><p>1. ((download speed) / (bitrate)) * (movie length) = (download time)<br>Thus, for a 100-minute movie, you're looking at 20 minutes for a 5Mbps cable connection, or ~35 minutes for a 3Mbps movie.  Sounds fair enough there.</p><p>Thus, the claims of being able to watch movies as they download, and download multiple movies simultaneously believable.  Of course, this assumes that your connection is the limiting factor, and not the iTMS servers.</p><p>2. (bitrate) * (movie length) = (movie size)<br>You are then looking at 7.5-9.0MB/minute, or 450-540MB/hr, or 750-900MB for that same 100-minute movie.  (Those of you folks that download movies can back these numbers up.)</p><p>Continuing, the new 80GB iPod could hold 150-175 hours of video, or 90-105 movies at 100 minutes apiece, or 200-240 episodes of hour-long TV (which clock in at just under 45 minutes apiece), or roughly the entire 10-season run of Stargate SG-1 along with a few of the Atlantis crossover episodes for completeness.</p><p>Who's up for an iPod mod that makes the wheel look like the Stargate?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The same thing Justin mentioned--the possibility that Apple could start offering high-definition movies through this service--ocurred to me as well.  The HD/Blu-Ray format war between the DVD player manufacturers isn't going to end anytime soon, and supposedly the licensing language for one of those formats (Blu-ray, I think) would prevent the manufacture of a DVD player that could play either HD or Blu-ray discs.  If Apple did offer high-def movies via download, that could be a real problem for these high-def DVD formats.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not overly thrilled with the concept of downloading movies.  It is pretty much DVD quality now (640x480 as opposed to DVD's 720x480), but the sound quality will be less and you still can't watch it on anything but your computer.  At least until Apple rolls out the iTV next spring which will allow you to stream your movies from your computer to your television.  Thats pretty nice.</p><p>The other issue with downloading movies is storage.  These movies are going to take up space.  You'll need to back up.  So why not buy the DVD to start and then rip it to your computer?  That way, you've got a backup from the beginning.</p><p>I guess I'm just old school.  I can always sell my old DVD's if I want.  Can't sell downloads.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you have to iPod video and the dock that has s-video putput you can watch it on the tv.  Granted the quality isn't as good with s-vid but still.  (I do it now, just wich I could convert Media Center tv files to iPod format with sound!)</p><p>I for one am thrilled about movie being available, for the simple reason that I now have something more interesting to watch/do/look at on the train than the same graffiti painted walls.  And I don't have to deal with the possibility of losing a UMD like I did when watching on the PSP.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, at least it's a start. Kinda like when I got my 1st cell phone and paid $30 for 30 minutes...</p><p>But, this isn't compelling enough for anyone to get rid of their Netflix/Blockbuster subscription. I don't know about you guys, but I rarely buy DVDs anymore anyway -- especially since I can rent 10-12 a month for $15/month.</p><p>I hope that eventually there will be some sort of subscription service for downloadable movies that rivals Netflix/Blockbuster... and for me to switch, it'd probably have to be in HD.</p></div>
