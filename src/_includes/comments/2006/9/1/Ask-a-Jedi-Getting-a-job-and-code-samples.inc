		<div class="comment_text"><p>If I could make a suggestion, having one code sample (however cool) is like only having one Resume. If you're pitching a small shop that needs an all rounder, you need to throw in something that works end to end with CSS and HTML. If the person who makes the hiring decsion is into OO, show Java integration, if they're into "cool stuff", show them something pretty in Flex 2. If they want you to maintain CF 5, show what you can do with tha. If they could also do with some help in the Kitchen, cook them breakfast one day!</p><p>Start by figuring out your ideal job and put together code samples for those, but if (say) you love back end but are open to an all rounder postion (I don't know what the job market is like in London right now), make sure to show some end to end solutions.</p><p>Oh, and if they have are committed to framework that you know, may be worth tweaking a sample to run on that framework so they know the learning curve won't be too steep.</p><p>Ray and I are probably into the same kind of programmers, but that doesn't mean the people hiring you will be looking for that!</p><p>Best Wishes,<br>Peter</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm always amazed when I hear companies wanting to see a candidate's code samples! Unless the candidate is active in the open source community (an admirable activity, to be sure) then anything they've written is almost certainly someone else's intellectual property and absolutely could not be shared with another company.</p><p>There's also the danger than in order to satisfy this (in my opinion silly) demand for code samples, candidates will actually grab some random bit of open source code and offer it up as their own. Think that doesn't happen? I was contacted recently by a hiring manager (at some company I don't even remember - so don't ask!) who had just received a code sample from a candidate... a piece of code *I* wrote and released as open source!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dang - they figured out I'd used your code. Sorry about that :-&gt;</p><p>Seriously, when I'm looking to hire, if I can't get someone I know from one of the lists, I give candidates coding projects to do so I can see how they do things (and I can make sure it is truly their code) and how long it takes. I don't care how good their code can be, I want to know what they can do for me in 25 minutes under pressure!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Peter, I really don't like those "code under pressure" interviews - I think it just shows the interviewer is a jerk. Real programmers don't code under those conditions. I've walked out of interviews like that and won't work for any company that asks that sort of stupid question in an interview. It's no measure of a candidate's real ability... it's just macho posturing by the company / interviewer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Our company is currently looking to hire a new developer. One thing that our development manager did was take a small, recently completed project and give the guy fifteen minutes to study the requirements and then half an hour to pseudo-code a solution. Although the developer didn't write any actual code, he handed in a solution that gave our manager a solid idea of his thought process, style, and abilities. He gave the developer some basic quizzing on the language, but anyone can learn vocab and syntax. My manager got a good idea of what kind of programmer the guy was, while not asking him to fork over someone else's intellectual property.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't see the purpose of asking for code samples as asking for intellectual property. If a candidate says that he can do CFC's, UDF's, stored procedures, etc., then I want to see if he is telling the truth BEFORE I hire him. Ideally, I would like to have those samples before he comes in for an interview.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In the past I use to have some OSS applications that I wrote on my web site. If someone wanted code samples I would just tell them to download them from the web site and go poking around.</p><p>Nowadays since I only work on private projects, it's kinda hard for me to do such a thing. What I do do though is ask the client if I may include the code and web site as part of my profolio. Some say yes, a lot say no and I understand the reason.</p><p>I once had a company want the source code for <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FRolist.com%3AUwMWbYtsjVquKL6kCVlzpEWTzUY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Rolist.com">Rolist.com</a> for the submission of sample code. My brother would only let me submit the code if I brought it the person on my laptop and the guy had to sign a form (basically a combo of an NDA and non-compete) before he saw it. Needless to say, once I told them the terms, they wanted me to show them the code without signing and I told them I'll pass on the job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I think you've hit the nail on the head.</p><p>I know that when I interview a candidate, there is no way I can guarantee the samples brought in are the candidate's actual work. That's OK. I ask candidates to bring in "the code you are most proud of". I don't care about the code at all, as I've hired candidates with rather paltry samples. I'm looking for the pride. A good candidate gets excited when talking about his work, a little (emphasis on little) defensive when changes are suggested, and quick to incorporate and elaborate on bug fixes or improvements.</p><p>If I want to test the candidate's coding skill, I'll propose a problem (generally one that the company is actually working on) and ask him to talk through his solution with me. I know he probably won't come up with anything approaching usable code, but I get to see how he thinks and attacks a problem. I like this 'conversational' method because it is easy to flesh out his experience by moving the discussion in other directions without it feeling like a test.</p><p>I also agree with Sean, coding under pressure is not a Good Thing. I set aside a reasonable amount of time at the beginning of the interview to make the candidate comfortable. This generally only takes a few minutes. I simply ask him questions about his interests. It generally doesn't take long for him to get excited, and at that point, stress just bleeds off. I also assure the candidate immediately after sitting down that I understand interviews can be stressful, and I'm not judging him on his interview skills, "I just want to see what you are passionate about, and how you tackle problems".</p><p>The last, and possibly most important, question is "how do you feel about 80's music?"</p></div>
