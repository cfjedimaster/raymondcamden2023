		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chuck Boyce at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsswug.org%3AD9VJI0G9hB-Ldw0KqX65da6_cZ0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sswug.org">sswug.org</a> recommends code share.  In the case of SQL Server, it would be "your favorite stored procedure".<br>He says a lot of good training comes from people sharing their code.<br>Idea: How about us sharing our Application.cfcs with each other?  Care will have to be taken to make sure no passwords are revealed.  In addition, some security flaws may be exposed.  But if that were the case, then I would think that the person who exposes the security flaw will probably have a potential solution as well.</p><p>How about a forum called "My Application.cfc"?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd be interested in seeing your take on security. AND hope that you would have time to cover "authorization for more advanced security needs".</p><p>I'd really like for someone to take on a series of breeze presentations that cover the basics (we're talking kindergarden here) of CF and OO with Model-Glue. I'm a long time procedural developer trying to get my head wrapped around Model-Glue. It's slow going for me, though.</p><p>If that is already out there, point me to it (aside from your PDF series which I have already run through).</p><p>Josen</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I watched the recording and had a question about application.cfc.</p><p>Are you required to place all of the cffunctions in the component tag?  Or do they have defaults that will be used if not defined?</p><p>For example if i only place the cffuction onApplicationStart in the cfcomponent will the application.cfc run correctly?</p><p>Do i need to place onApplictionEnd in there?  Or any of the others?</p><p>Thanks, and great meetings!  Hopefully i will be able to do the next one live.</p></div>
