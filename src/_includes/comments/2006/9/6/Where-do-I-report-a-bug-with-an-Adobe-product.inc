		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks, Ray. The "go/wish" address is a port of the old Macromedia address, and the traditional Adobe address is here:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsupport%2Ffeature.html%3AAfBxqDN7jXlBfs-2P_aO4DZLXFQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/support/feature.html">http://www.adobe.com/suppor...</a></p><p>(I'm guessing these will be integrated when Creative Suite 3 arrives next year, but the old addresses will have to be redirected appropriately forever.)</p><p>One other request, if I could, is that most "bug reports" we see in the mailing lists are long descriptions of what someone did and thought... getting to the point, so that others can recreate the problem in a fresh file, is the key first step towards achieving any engineering change.</p><p>tx, jd</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>john, I noticed that the url you posted covers the Adobe products. So should folks use one or the other until the integrated form is released?</p><p>You know, I heard there is a technology that makes building web forms very easy. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The old Macromedia page got a new address, so it's currently in parallel to the old Adobe page. These two will likely get rolled into one, and I'm guessing this would be around the CS3 launch when all the categories and package names change, and they start a new round of feature analysis for the big suite of tools.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I'm glad you cleared this up Ray.  When I went to look for this on Adobe's site for ColdFusion I did see links to request product features for CF, but since it did not say "bug" on it I never clicked the link.</p></div>
