		<div class="comment_text"><p>Release of salaries through FOI requests are controversial.  Many people are quick to say they are elected officials - blah blah, but the majority of state/government employees are not elected.  I understand tax dollars are paying it so it is public record but I promise that having your name printed with your salary in the local paper is not fun.</p><p>When we receive FOI requests, HR calls the states Attorney General to see if we can release it.  Sounds like someone at the airport didn't want to release it and used security as the reason.</p><p>Is there anything similar to this in the private sector?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is such BS. Sounds like some are trying to show they are more important than they are. If the members of the NSC and what they are paid are not classified, I can't see how your dweebs can claim this. I spent way to many years in the USIC to listen to this kind of BS from civilians that haven't earned it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Giving out contact details, position in company etc. to strangers *is* a problem - go read Mitnick's book on social enginering if you don't believe me :-)</p><p>In this case, however, it sounds like they gave out a list of names, and another list of job titles. Which is fine, unless you really do have a (good) law that says you should be allowed to join them up, in which case that nukes the information leakage argument somewhat.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Newspapers as a whole are struggling with the whole "Freedom of Information" thing.  Our national organization - NAA - is spending lots on lobbying in Washington on this topic. It can be very frustrating for newspapers trying to cover the "issues of the day."  But you are right Ray in your statement - "Its part of our new world."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I can absolutely see how this is a security issue. The names of the workers at an airport along with their titles is of national security. If that information was public, wouldn't the terrorists then know who to target to get credentials? Now, job titles and salary mapped with no names are definitely not a security issue, so I think the issue revolves around the data provided, which was probably incorrect from the main articles primary purpose.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Phil, are you saying that knowing the names of employees is a security risk? We aren't talking about CIA members here, but employees at an airport tht tax payer dollars are going to. And we aren't talking mechanics here - but the administration, ie, the public officials.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Before I came to NASA, I worked for the Airport Industry.  During that time my job touched on writing a ColdFusion dynamic security questionnaire.  And I can tell you this about the way that its handled:</p><p>Bad = Names + Position + Salary</p><p>My favorite question we loaded into test that proved how much accurate that equation could be was, 'Is accepting payment on your credit card debts a bribe?'</p><p>Why?  Because someone desperate person might do just that, have some stranger pay his debt off.  Then comes in the extortion.  Then comes in the security breach.</p><p>Kevin Mitnick is a sharp cookie.</p><p>So the choice is security or our desired knowledge about our civil servants.  Which way do we go?  I suppose the answer is based on how much you fly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tom - would you need social engineering to know the name of the president of the US? Again - I think you are confusing the rank and file with the public administrators - folks whose name is already and known, and their title (as I said, the info was on the web site, along with pictures).</p><p>There -is- a provision in the FOI about security of course. From what I remember (and curse the paper for not putting this article on line), the airline had a formal way to respond and they simply chose not to. In other words, they didn't do anything right in terms of responding to the FOI request.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is so far from a security issue, it doesn't even hit the ground. All of this is public information.</p><p>And to Tom, don't confuse havin a dumb security guard with national security.  It may surprise all of you, but there is not security at any G.A. airport.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Reading the article, looks like the reporter was asking for a complete employee list with salaries.  Would your company supply it?  I hope not.  That is most certainly a risk to your employees.  Maybe you guys have never been followed around by someone who just won't get the message that you are not interested, but most women have at least once.</p><p>Government employee != public figure<br>Elected official == public figure</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't believe they wanted _every_ single employee, again, just the administration. (Now I'm really cursing my paper for not putting the article online. How dumb it is to put _some_ but not _all_ of your content online??)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, it was tough to tell from the posted article.  I've dealt with FOI requests, usually they ask for "all the records pertaining to x".  It's a reporter's job to find a story after all, and if they can't find anything good in the employee/salary list, well, not getting the "all the records" (whatever that means) will also make a good story in a pinch. ;)</p><p>Mikey AKA "just keep my name outta it"</p></div>
