		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>As always, I love your blog, and I am a big fan of (most :)) of your work, but this same application could have been built w/ CSS and AjaxCFC without the Flex2 overhead.</p><p>Now, I must admit that I am a bit impressed - this did seem to load MUCH more quickly than Flex apps were loading the last time I took a look at them (and its been a bit), but I am still not overly convinced that Flex2 is the best method by which to build RIA applications like this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't misunderstand me (and yes, I remember we've had this....disagreement? in the past) I understand the potential of Flex2.  I just think that one can reach the same goals without the overhead with AjaxCFC (and no, I truly have nothing to do w/ Rob - only laid eyes on him once).</p><p>AjaxCFC's communication w/ the server after the app if loaded might not be as speedy as Flex2, but the initial load time is miniscule, and (at least for our users) that is the big deal.  They simply don't want to wait for the page to load.</p><p>If there weren't any other options, then maybe I'd be willing to live w/ the load time.  But there ARE, and while I would never say "I'll NEVER use that" about ANYTHING, I am always going to look for the best compromise between 'look-and-feel' (which, lets be honest, is really what Flex2 is all about) and functionality.</p><p>Anyway, again, I apologize for (once again) using your blog as a soapbox in my crusade against Flex2.  And to be honest (though I haven't looked at it in....hell, months, I think) I am not overly impressed w/ Spry - just doesn't seem like its grown up yet...</p><p>But believe me, Ray, I will be looking over your shoulder to see what you're doing and keeping an eye on how you're doing it :)</p></div>
