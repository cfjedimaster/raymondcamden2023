		<div class="comment_text"><p>$649 seems a bit expensive. <br>I remember there was a discussion long time ago about who gets a share of the sales. Are you getting anything if I buy the AD105 - Introduction to ColdFusion Components  presentation?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Honestly I do not. I knew that beforehand and I have no problem with it. Of course, I wouldn't mind getting a kick back, but... what do you do? I give away a lot of my content for free already anyway. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So, once you provide them with the content of the presentation they have full rights on it?</p><p>Could you possible post your whole presentation here and probably add a couple items to your wishlist?</p><p>I'm sure a couple items from the list would cost far less than $649 and I for one would rather do it that way than just giving away the money without any benefit for the author.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually did post the PPT and files. And yes, they do have the rights to that video. It doesn't mean I can't give it again - but to be honest - it would most likely NOT be over Breeze as it was a long preso.</p></div>
