		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just put a redirect on the two emails I use the most, sent them to Gmail.  Gmail also lets you "prove" you own those emails, then once you do you can send from Gmail using the other addresses.  Since I can get to Gmail via my phone and Gmail has already garbaged 5 spam emails in the last 10 minutes, I am a pretty happy camper.  You learn more from Ray  by accident than elsewhere by design.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I take a different approach. Since I run my on mail server, I move all spam to spam folders and have ColdFusion pull out the IP address of the mail server. I then add that IP address to a database and the mail server now rejects any connection from that server. In one week, I cut spam mail down from just over 10,000 messages a week to under 100 a week.</p><p>It won't kill it all, but it is less the 1% now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How about SpamPal? It is a proxy-type app that runs on your PC. I was extremely happy with it in the past plus it's free. I disabled it as I had my CrystalTech setup handling spam quite nicely. Having move to a VPS solution, I'm finding that Spamassassin v2.55 is pretty lame (or maybe it's just my setup? :) ).</p><p>Terry</p></div>
