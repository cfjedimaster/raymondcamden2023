One of your entries evidently has a bad &lt;li&gt; tag.  after reading that article, all other articles have a bullet in front of each paragraph...  I have been shying away from FLEX for a while now, but see that I really must start playing with it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Any chance you're considering a Flex interface for the Admin component of BlogCFC?  I built an extremely simple, limited function Flex interface of my own several weeks ago just to get my feet wet with Flex, but I ran in to some trouble with the ability to choose multiple categories for a single post and never really had the time to work through it.  I'd be interested to see how you handle that.</p><p>Thanks,<br>M. McConnell</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, sorry for the really pedantic question, but your blog is the first thing I've gotten running in ColdFusion, and I'd like your Flex Blog to get working too, more to see how things work than anything else - also my first Flex project:)</p><p>I've tried all the ways I can think to get the Flex to sit on top of the blog (the blog is working, it's my homepage), but I keep getting a blank app with no data, just the Flex front end. I rename the blogproxycfc.txt and put that into the org&gt;camden&gt;blog folder as blogproxy.cfc, and I run the application in Flex, then move the entire bin over inside the stock 'client' directory, where the blog itself sits. Am I doing anything wrong, or missing anything? I'm a total newbie with both Flex and CF...</p><p>I've tried opening it as a basic Flex Project, and as one with CF.</p><p>The blog works: http://74.121.52.104/client/index.cfm</p><p>The Flex version gives me a blank app: http://74.121.52.104/client/bin/blogcfc.html</p><p>Any suggestions? And once again, sorry for the very basic Qs.</p><p>Shawn</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks very much Ray. I had org/etc under client, so I moved it under htdocs. So now all under different folders I have:</p><p>htdocs/org<br>htdocs/client<br>htdocs/BlogCFC/bin/blogcfc.html</p><p>Still not working (but at least the main blog still is, fortunately) and now I'm getting a wait clock so that's probably good...searching for something it can't find).</p><p>I recompiled it (still not sure if it should be a CF project or Basic Flex, but if I choose CF it forces me to NOT use my webserver, i.e., to put it under wwwroot instead of htdocs), which completely undermines my attempt for the last couple months to get CF under Apache (Adobe says never run CF over the net without a proper webserver).</p><p>I'll figure out what ServiceCapture is. I tried to run the debug, but it doesn't give me a .pdf.</p><p>I have too much to learn to be bothering you anymore. Thanks for your time, it has been appreciated. I'll give it a crack again when I have a bit more of a clue. (The good ole' days of running Flash and PHP under Apache seem like child's play right now...). I'm in mental overload mode LOL.</p><p>I know I sound like a loser, I'm just confronting a lot at once. I'm hungry, and I'll get it all, eventually...Java, J2EE/JRun4 servers, CF, Tomcat, Flex 2, FDS2...lots of 'holy cow man' for a photographer/webdesign wannabe...:)</p><p>Shawn</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Shawn, don't run away just yet. :) Let me try to help you where I can as you have a few problems here.</p><p>First off, ServiceCapture is a program. You can find it here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkevinlangdon.com%2FserviceCapture%2F%3AfLMRzYlBOE_EWvSZxjIrDTxNDYY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://kevinlangdon.com/serviceCapture/">http://kevinlangdon.com/ser...</a>. It isn't free, but it is cheap and is DANG good at working with stuff like this. Download it and try it out and you should see why your request is still failing.</p><p>You do want to "use CF" for the Flex project. It should still use the web server. Not quite sure what you mean there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, thanks very much. I ain't down for the count, just frustrated that I don't seem to 'get' Flex yet, outside pressing "Play" on the samples that come with it. (Actually that's not true, I made a button link to an Flash/AMFPHP Hello World page I made a while back...woohoo!).</p><p>I've jumped from shoving other people's scripts in PHP onto a bundled Apache/MySQL/PHP box and getting 'OK' with AS Version 1 to trying to go the whole way with OOP, AS3, Java servers (big fooey on that part!), and most of all, understanding CF/Flex so I can start writing my own stuff instead of incessantly lifting from others. That (using what's out there already) works for design (I've already tweaked a bit of your front end, and that's much appreciated!), but it doesn't work very well at all when you have small-business-calibre databases in your head (like building db-driven photo galleries for people who want to have a comments section for each photograph...etc.), which is where I'd like to head, i.e., to become actually viable, at least within a team.</p><p>What's that got to do with your amazing Blog? Nuttin'...but your Blog, and a small number of other samples/open-source projects, are my starting point into all this, in earnest, because I need to struggle with working projects in order to learn...I can't start from the ground up, I'm just not that logical.</p><p>Ever heard anyone write a poem who hasn't been a fan of other people's poetry for years? That's where the word "Nantucket" came from...:)</p><p>I'll keep at it, and thanks for the encouragement, and the debugging thingie. I'll get that ASAP.</p><p>All the best for the New Year, Ray.</p><p>Shawn</p></div>
