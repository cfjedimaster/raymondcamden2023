		<div class="comment_text"><p>So... this means that we should reject everything they say about the gulf war also? LOL (Bottom line, they market the news. You can't tell what is truth and what is not by the integrity of the reporter unless you truely know the reporter.) I will state that there are religious news channels that taint the news to the same degree as secular news. Truth is, the love of money is the root of all evil. When money is a tool, it's a great servant. When money is a goal it's a poor master! ( IMO )</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>LOL, CNN must have missed coverage of 9/11 then. CNN must have missed covering Hamas in stirring up the recent war with Isreal. Now granted, like Christians there are different factions (beliefs and interpretations) inside Islam like there are inside Christianity and any other religion/faith. Those who think they are becoming martyrs by blowing themselves up are another example that it isn't just a Christian belief. I can understand someone questioning if it's true just because a group says it is. Yet, my point is simple. It's obviously believed by a number of those claiming to be part of the global Jihad (if that is how you spell it in English.) CNN if they believe that need to wake up.</p><p>(NOTE: I do not think that the radical belief is common among all Islam. Or else the term 'radical' would not be attached to those who hold onto Israel's soldiers till this day and cause their own people to suffer to make a point!)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I couldn't watch the videos since the IT people have youtube blocked here at work, but I'm willing to bet those clips are from a documentary called "Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism". You should definitely check it out, if you get the chance. That particular incident doesn't even begin to show their perversion of the news.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't personally think that ANY news organization has a LEGAL responsibility to tell the truth (and lets be honest, every news organization in the world - or at least the U.S. - slants the news to fit their political 'slant'....from CNN to MSNBC to FOX to........).  However, if their caught simply spinning baloney, then I would *hope* that Americans would vote w/ their remote controls....</p><p>But then again, this is a country where the pet rock sold MILLIONS of units.  So nobody ever claimed we were a country of brain surgeons....  FOX could come out tomorrow and say - 80% of what we've reported in the last 5 years has been garbage, and you'd still have the Limbaughs of the world that point to the other 20% and claim it was the most accurate reporting available.  And believe me (I am a died-in-the-wool conservative), CNN has its apologists, too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hahahahahaha, because NPR doesn't have THE single most liberal slant in the country....  I don't, as a rule, listen to NPR, so I can't speak to their veracity.  But I have listened enough to know that NPR has even more of a liberal slant than MSNBC or CNN.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - Fox goes just as hard the other way (fair and balanced my ass), but don't throw NPR into the ring as a 'non-slanted' news source.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am late on this, sorry, just stumbled on it.</p><p>Another good source of news and views is <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FDemocracyNow.org%3ADlnoSUp5vMxp67kbr-Res3fqDqo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="DemocracyNow.org">DemocracyNow.org</a>.  I am somewhere in the middle of the road camp, socially liberal and fiscally conservative.  DN seems to present good information that I can research.  The do not shy away from something because there corporate sponsors or owner (they have none) would not want it reported.</p><p>I deplore the way FOX News and CNN twist news and events.  There is a lot of falsehood, ommission, conjecture and just plain distortion and spin.  But, this is to be expected in a world full of consumers who sit and watch 24 hour a day TV, consume it.  Sadly, more people know Paris Hiltons' sisters name than know who I our Secretary of Defense was during the run up the war.</p><p>What is important to note is that both FOX and, to a lesser degree, CNN, are focused on their own causes, not reporting news to the people.  Now, no news is fully objective.  If it were, it would not be being reported by humans.  As a younger man, I saw many dead people while on a trip to Africa and it affected me in a way I would not come to understand for many, many years.  It changed how I thought about things (a whole different subject).  I feel the same can happen with reporters.</p><p>The other note is that journalism has declined greatly from the days of the 50s through 70s.  People reporting the news really are bubble headed bleeched blondes.  I rarely see anyone reporting the news who maybe understands it in the context of history.</p><p>I am also astounded by how little news is reported.  I mean, I can watch a congressional hearing on the torture with Addington and Yoo and never see a thing about it on CNN or FOX except some spin on how the congress attacked them.</p><p>Good cautionary tale movies:<br>Rollerball (the original) - the world is ruled by oligarchies.<br>Farenhiet 451 - lets burn the bad books<br>1984 - The loss of personal rights and privacy</p></div>
