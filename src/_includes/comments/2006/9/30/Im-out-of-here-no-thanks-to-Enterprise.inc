		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, the Seinfeld episode. lol That's exactly what happened. Jerry says, you know how to TAKE a reservation, but you don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And the holding is really the most important part. Anybody can take a reservation (arms waiving like he's writing a bunch of reservations).</p><p>Glad you got it worked out though. Have a good vacation.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Have a great trip Ray</p><p>BTW, Budget really is the best to rent from. I been renting from them a few times a year for 5 years and had almost no problems and their prices are excellent. And you can usually get a better deal using your Entertainment Guide, AAA and internet promotion codes!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow... been there had that done to me about 10 times. The VW dealership we bought our Jetta from gives us a rental credit at Enterprise whenever we drop off the car for service. As a result I always call in a "Reservation" days in advance... 2 years later I have NEVER gotten the car I asked for. I even found the SUV I wanted at another location across town the day before my rental, they simply did not care enough to try to get it. If I wasnt getting the car for free I would never use them.</p></div>
