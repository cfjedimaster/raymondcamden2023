		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think doing beginner stuff is fine because:<br>It’s harder to go from zero to 10mph than it is from 10 to 20.<br>When you’re a beginner, you want to know what you need to learn, but also what you can ignore.  Matt and Peter at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FColdFusionWeekly.com%3AGUr6AUS57Ehaxxsyl5yKElj5yso&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="ColdFusionWeekly.com">ColdFusionWeekly.com</a> talk about cfinsert and cfupdate as being harmless because no one uses them.<br>But I say that for a beginner, having to learn the meaning of tags with dubious value, and then having to use the mental energy to determine that they fall short of being useful is a lot of valuable time wasted.  <br>Reference books tend to feel the need to explain every deprecated tag.<br>I would have loved an “Essential ColdFusion” booklet that said something like “I don’t use cfInsert.  Here’s how I do CRUD operations…”<br>As a beginner, my goal was to read the entire manual before making a decision on how to start writing code.  In doing a so, a million decisions had to be made.  What I had to do was try to come up with some standards so that I wasn’t in a perpetual rewrite cycle.  Should I use cfinvoke, CreateObject, cfset CreateObject or cfScript?<br>And I’m not talking about whole frameworks.  I’m talking about the syntax for a single command!<br>So to have someone say “This is how you do it”<br>&lt;cfset FooObj = CreateObject(“component”,”components.Foo”).Init(Application.DSN)<br>&lt;cfset FooQry = FooObj.View1(FooID)<br>Would be invaluable not only for a beginner, but for the whole ColdFusion community.</p><p>Now right away I can hear you saying that every application is different and you can’t prescribe the same treatment for every situation.  I’m saying you can show how you have decided to do it for one of your applications.<br>Secondly, I know that you’re probably taking a look at the syntax I’ve posted and have some corrections you’d like to make.  You’re probably saying “Why did you name it FooObj?”  “How did you come up with the function name View1?”  “I wouldn’t use Application.DSN”.  All this is part of becoming a ColdFusion Jedi.  We should say that the Jedi community promotes a certain syntax.<br>Surely we can agree on SELECT * FROM Foo!</p><p>Earlier I was reading Hal Helm’s “Introduction to CFCs” written in 2002.  One of the writers was recommending using the “this” scope.  I think the standard has since evolved in the last 4 years to not using the “this” scope.  So my point is to show what we’ve decided as of late.  A book can’t revise what is printed.  But your blogCFC is always the latest copy.  So use it to demonstrate how you do ColdFusion programming.</p></div>
