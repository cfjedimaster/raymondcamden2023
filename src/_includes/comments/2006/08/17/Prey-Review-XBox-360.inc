		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree.  I just rented this game, thank goodness, because I will not spend the high dollar they ask for Xbox 360 games on Prey.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Though I understand your adversion to violence with children in the media the fact remains that the game was given a mature rating. This means that there are several things both heard and scene that may be offensive. I, for one didnt like that the protagonist used foul language so often. I mean who swears to himself that often anyway. I didnt like that they portayed the native culture in such an obvious stereotypical way. Even the wise old grandfather was getting waisted in Jens bar.</p><p>My point is that in a Mature rated game there are going to be things that offend someone. Not recommending an M rated game because it contains violence your not comfortable with doesnt make any sense to me.</p><p>The violence with the children was supposed to be there. We are supposed to be feeling that a terrible thing is happening to the worldgiving us a feeling of dred and wanting revenge and seeing the brutal disregard for our lives or even our childrens lives really works.</p><p>That being said I also do not recommend the game but really its because i find the puzzles flat and dull, the only shooting you do is in repetative waves of predictable enemies and to be honest the game was boring. Its not often the a shooter bores me but man its dull!<br>The gun models look nice but shooting was uncomfortable and inaccurate. Graphics are done very well but complicated level design could have been beter.</p><p>Graphics: 9/10<br>Sound:    9/10<br>Gameplay: 4/10<br>Overall:</p><p>GRIMTHORN</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,</p><p>I've just bought the game and I love it.</p><p>The swearing is amusing, and, as far as the featured children are concerned, they're just graphics in a video game, so I really don't see what the problem is.</p><p>To me, there's no difference in having to shoot a graphic child, than having to shoot a graphic woman, animal, man or beast.</p><p>It's just a frickin game for gawds sake.</p><p>Me.</p></div>
