		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll second the BBB suggestion, stongly!  I had to contact them several years when I bought a new computer from a company  called Nutrend (they got assimilated a few years later), and when I informed Nutrend of that they finally got their act in order.</p><p>In my cases, they had left me on hold for 3-4 hours on several occasions after delivering me a computer that did not meet my order specs and a video card/monitor combination that constantly flickered (which later they informed me was a "known issue" to them...WHAT?).  When I threatened to report them, they finally made the return/refund happen.  However, their accounting dept must have missed the memo, and they went on to refund my money (approx. $2000 back then) in a series of electronic deposits and electronic deductions (which after about 10 of them finally evened out to the amount of my refund).</p><p>After that crap, I did report them.  It may not seem like much, but it's as much of a red mark on them as a missed payment on a credit report.  Once they pile up, the company would be in big trouble.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I bought a 98 Honda Civic last year. The most reliable car in the world, right? Granted it had 100K on it. Not sure what the previous owner did to it over the 7 years of ownership. But let me just say 1. it is refered to as "the damn car" and 2. I get nervous cranking up the old lawnmower</p></div>
