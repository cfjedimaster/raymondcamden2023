		<div class="comment_text"><p>I couldn't agree with you more Ray. My first REAL forway into CF was a desire to build an e-commerce site to sell toys and action figures online. While that application did work, it sucked. But I learned volumes about ColdFusion in a very short time.</p><p>Today, my learning continues this way. Each project I strive to incorporate something new I have learned or want to learn. That's the col thing about this industry, if you like to learn you never have to stop learning!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you can find a way to tie it to something you like to do in your daily life, even better.  It'll keep you more motivated to at least get going somewhere.  For instance, I love to knit, and I have a large inventory of yarns, needles, patterns.  There's no application on the Macintosh platform.  So, I had to roll my own application, with help of a database schema that a knitting blogger who is a dba put together (this was also good in helping me learn MySQL since I had to convert it from MSSQL to MySQL).  I use this app to learn new CF stuff.  One of those days I'll turn it to a Flex app when I get it figured out.  Or some other new technology that Adobe dreams up . . .</p><p>I've got a long list of functionalities that I want to add - for instance, generating basic sweater patterns (it's really more of an algorithm, for instance, cuff is usually 10 to 15% of the total sleeve stitches) using a person's measurements that I put into this application.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having introduced a couple of dozen would-be programmers to ColdFusion I have come up with a very good example application to get someone going with CF.  I use a contact manager application, everyone knows what one of these is supposed to do and if they decide to take it far enough it is something they could use for themselves.  Using this has served myself and the programmers I have taught very well.</p></div>
