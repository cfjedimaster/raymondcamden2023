		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, the redirects have really changed some things about how I lay out my XML file. I used to be a strong advocate of public/private event pairs to handle almost everything that a user needed to be logged in for.</p><p>However, as it stands now, there's really no reason to do that since you can use a redirect (which fires as soon as it's set, not when the event ends) to pull out of a "restricted" event or show the right page even when you're only using one event-handler tag.</p><p>I hope that made sense! :)</p></div>
