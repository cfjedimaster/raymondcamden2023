		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've just about given up on Excel reporting.  So many quirks and glitches it seems.  I do most reports in CSV now.  I once had a ton of data disappear from an excel report because some comments had a &amp;LT in them...It rendered fine in the browser, but excel just cut everthing after the &amp;LT.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have a slightly newer version which I think fixes it. Unfortunately I "lost" my 6.1 install. If you want to best test it on cfmx6, that's fine by me. Just please email me later in the week as I'm in Aspen right now. The upgrade also fixes a fix other things, and removes the need for mappings from the app.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The cftimer was a mistake, and the style thing should work in 6/7 in my local version. I basically moved the 7 code to an include so it won't throw an error in 6.</p></div>
