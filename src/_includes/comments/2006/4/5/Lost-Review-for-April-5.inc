		<div class="comment_text"><p>Whew, you just saved me, thanks a bunch.  I programmed a Tivo recording that clipped the end of Lost right at the point Libby shows up just after Dave pitches himself off the cliff.  My wife was not happy about the clipping, and I was getting "the look".    Although, I just held my laptop up and read your review to her to compensate, and she might be even madder knowing what we missed.</p><p>If I don't ever show up at work again, you'll know what happened.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sean, I have to say that I find myself many times wishing that Lost was just a 2 hour movie so I could finally know what the heck is going on...and that to me is great television.  They have me hooked like Ray and I only hope that the big "reveal" whether it is this season or next or 9 down the road is worth the wait.</p><p>How many episodes have you watched?  There are about 5 of us at my office who are hooked and 3 are still watching the first season on DVD.  I think all of them would agree that it took forcing themselves to get through the first 3-4 episodes to finally see what all the hype was about.  Now they all love it and I try to tell them that Season 2 has been even better.  (Except for Anna Lucia who I wish would be eatten by the next polar bear encounter)!</p></div>

The first 'hallucination' we observed was Jake seeing his dead dad walk away from the beach. And then the coffin was empty. The many of visits of Walt.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, the one thing that Henry did say that I believe is true, is that the Bearded Guy is not "Him".  As far as the countdown goes, I also think that Henry is trying to trick Locke into letting the countdown expire because he knows what will happen when it does.  So, he types in the numbers himself (notice that he only had to be told once what the correct sequence is even though he fell and had a concussion) and then he tells Locke that he didn't type them in so that Locke will allow the countdown to expire sometime in the future when he's not there.</p><p>I wonder if "Henry" is "Him".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First thing: The Sopranos season 6 is much much better and we should all be raving about that instead.</p><p>Secondly, i have to confess i am enjoying Lost. My theory is that they are all dead and they are in purgatory. When they have redeemed themselves they die... like Shannon finally fell in love and dies, her brother got over shannon and dies etc etc.</p><p>The thing that confuses me is the links between each character before they were on the plane. Maybe fate has linked them all and they were all supposed to die on that plane? I don't really have a good explaination for that one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gavin: Your theory is the same as my original theory except for 2 problems that have come up.</p><p>a.  the producers have shot the theory down, although they may just be doing that to throw everyone off</p><p>b.  what about the children - shouldn't they be "gone" and not hanging with the others</p><p>I like the "experimenting on them" theory better because it makes sense that they would not "experiment" on the children.  Still, when we last saw the children they were all dirty like the others were when they were in the disguises.... were the children just dressed up that way too, and if so, why...ahhhhhh!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I must say that he is also my favorite bad guy. My mom asked me, "Do you like his eyes, cause I don't" and I said yeah, his eyes are the best part about him. They are his character. He plays it off so well and just as he manipulates Locke, he manipulates me as well!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I woke up early the other day because i came to a semi-realization. Hurley will find out that Libby is was lying to him because she told him he knew her from the plane when he stepped on her foot. but if he was going passed her, why was she in the tail section of the plane??? We, the veiwers, know she is lying, but Hurley will end up putting 2 and 2 together i think.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think everything is going to revolve around the food because it's all drugged. most of the people who have had a lot of it have had halucinations. Hurley, for example, saw Jin and a guy in a chicken outfit. And, more recently, started to see Dave again.<br>I think now that everyone has a stash of food they will start to have more visions... Maybe we'll see something tonight!!!!</p><p>Ray- i think you're right. Libby is probably embarassed about being a mental patient. I still need to know why!!! why!?!?!?!?</p></div>
