		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was the one the mentioned the post about the church :-D. Also I agree with Robert in that it was definitely a face of everything going as was planned.</p><p>I am very much looking forward to the next episode. It is probably good for me that it won't be on for a while so I can get to bed a little earlier...er perhaps spend that time playing halo or Rise of Legends.</p></div>

I love how Bernard, in the beginning, says something I think we all feel - why isn't everyone still fighting to get off the island. Why aren't people checking into everything, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am not sure if it is coincidence or not, but has anyone else noticed that recently there has been an increase in the references to how long they have been on the island?</p><p>Here's another thought.  I personaly think Lilly is one of the Others.  Following that theory, Jack and Hurley both encountered people in the past who had connections to Darhma (Jack met Desmond, and HUrley was 'committed' with Lilly).  Could be a coincidence, but who knows?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Johnathan -- Yeah, I caught that.  Saw his name in the opening credits and got really excited.  (He was AWESOME in Farscape!)  But then he had such a wittle-bitty part.  I was dissapointed, but hey.</p><p>I kept asking my wife "Do you recognize him? Huh, huh, huh?"  She didn't.  We're used to the mask and the Aussie accent threw us off.  If I hadn't known what I was looking for...I wouldn't have recognized him either!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anybody think that Vincent symbolizes something. Like every time we see him something big happens. Last night, for instance, Sawyer feeds Vincent and within a few minutes Michael comes running out of the jungle. The last time i remember seeing that dog was when Shannon and Sayed were chasing Walt's ghost or whatever and then Ana Lucia caps Shannon's ass... Does this mean that Walt is near???</p><p>I'm glad that some loose ends were tied up at least. This episode didn't bring up a ton of questions. Just a few key questions. namely, why the hell does the island posess healing powers?</p><p>I'm telling you that food is drugged, man!!! Especially the Apollo candy bars. they are the only food that has it's own colorful wrapper. everything else is just in the generic white and black Dharma logo. I think they come in a Darhma box, but the wrappers are different.</p></div>
