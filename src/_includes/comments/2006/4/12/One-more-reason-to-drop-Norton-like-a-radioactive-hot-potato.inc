Now I'm using Free AVG on my PCs and ClamAVX on the Mac.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I stopped using Norton AV a few years ago when I realized that most of the SystemWorks pack was a waste of time, at the same time that NAV kept *reducing* in functionality with each release while consuming more resources just so they could make the UI more flashy each time.</p><p>For a year-or-so I used Trend Internet Suite which was pretty good, but its <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvirus.gr%3ADe7sDgf4ht5Z9TCLflw-Nvb9cTM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="virus.gr">virus.gr</a> results aren't the best.  I had started using Kaspersky Internet Suite (6.0 beta) and thought its virus facilities were great though its firewall is a bit odd.  We're cutting back expenses (esp geek crap) so last night I installed AntiVir 7.0 (free) and ZoneAlarm 6.1, and they seem to work well.  Neither use a lot of CPU, so give 'em a try.</p><p>I've also tried Avast 4.6, which had one very interesting feature, it could scan the system before the OS had fully loaded, before any viruses would have initiated, which I've not seen in other apps.  AVG is also quite good but I've not tried the newer v7 releases.</p><p>In a word, trust <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvirus.gr%3ADe7sDgf4ht5Z9TCLflw-Nvb9cTM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="virus.gr">virus.gr</a>.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I absolutely despise Norton Internet Security.<br>I only have it loaded on my desktop, but I can never install any games that have any network connectivity in them (warcraft, etc).</p><p>I've set the setting on it to minimum, to allow most everything.  However, if I temporarily disable NAV auto-protect.  Then every minute, I get a popup that only stays for a few milliseconds.  You can't really see it or read it but you see a yellow flash.  You may think that's not a problem, but imagine being in the middle of a battle in warcraft, and just as you are about to get swarmed by your enemy, your desktop flashes up because of the infernal nano-second popup!</p><p>I tend to disable auto-protect when I'm installing any software.  Needless to say I can't install much on my desktop anymore because the installation hangs due to those infernal popups that you can't disable.</p><p>I was lucky enough to read it really quick once.  It was complaining that my security was low (due to NAV being temporarily disabled).  But it doesn't stay up long enough for you to click the box "Don't display this message".</p><p>You can't even uninstall the stupid thing because it's all over the registry and hidden files, and causes all kind of problems.  It doesn't let you install NAV alone, because it somehow detects that I previously had NIS installed and it sends all kind of red flags.</p><p>I hate it I hate it I hate it.</p><p>Anyway, I think I'll eventually have to just wipe my machine and go with an alternative AV solution eventually.</p><p>I now exclusively use my laptop which is now severely overloaded with all sorts of development software (cf, php, mysql) as well as all my games.  I'm thinking it's going to catch fire one of these days.  It's getting to the point where it'll wake people up at night due to it's fan running.</p><p>Cheers and thanks for all the fish,<br>-AA</p></div>
