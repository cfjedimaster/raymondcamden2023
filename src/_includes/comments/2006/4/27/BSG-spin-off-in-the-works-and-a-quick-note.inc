		<div class="comment_text"><p>I quit TV in 1984, and people have tried numerous times to get me interested in this show or that.  I could barely sit through a half hour of anything until I saw the mini-series leading up to BSG.  I seriously think this series is the best thing on TV since the 70's; maybe longer.</p><p>Amusingly, about two minutes before I saw your post, I saw *my* friend had sent me the same link.</p><p>Friends don't let friends miss BSG links.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I peronally would rather they just go ahead and start the next season. It's taken a while but I think I've finally gotten used to Starbuck being a Chic. Can't wait to see how they get off that planet and what will happen to Baltar in the process!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got into BSG at the beginning of the second season, so I had to go back and watch the first to catch up.  Wow! What an impressive series.</p><p>I have been listening to the BSG writer's meetings.  They are like an hour and a half of the writer's bouncing ideas off on another.  Pretty interesting to listen their creative process.  You can find those either on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsci-fi.com%3A19gPBdg8tJpTHo2y10Y6fjfZJjU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sci-fi.com">sci-fi.com</a> or itunes.  I'm subscribed so I get them as soon as they come out.  Season three sounds like it will have some interesting twists...</p><p>BTW... Does Baltar make anyone else want to throw furniture?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>BSG is the best show on TV nothing comes close, I was amazed to see this topic on this website. I am into (obviously) coldfusion and love BSG, the plot is so intricate and the story twists and turns like a rollacoaster.  Grace park is nice too!  Cannot wait for season three. The finale of season two was awesome.  Frack it!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes I am fairly knew here.  I have been to this website a few times, the whole Jedi thing brought me back.<br>By the way Jason - Baltar is one of the best characters on the show, the genius scientist, that is manipulated by the cyclons.  I identify most with him. Without Baltar you couldn't have a show.  The spin off series would be really cool if its anything like the current BSG.  From the article on the spin off, maybe Adarma is a cylon!?</p></div>
