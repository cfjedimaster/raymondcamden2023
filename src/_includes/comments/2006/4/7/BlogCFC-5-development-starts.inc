		<div class="comment_text"><p>Any chance you'll rewrite the code base so it's more flexible and robust in general?  I'm referring primarily to the way the code currently handles/depends on mappings and multiple users. I'm just curious.  Nic Tunney's decided to rewrite the code (I'm actually not sure if it's even based on your code base but I know it will support the same DB schema or have an upgrade path), whih I'm really looking forward to, as the current ode is OK for a simple site but really doesn't suit my needs at all.  I'd like to see you do this yourself, personally.  If I can find the time, I'll do it myself and shoot the code over to you for review.....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree with the pod sorting. Less bloat, more blog.  blogCFC is for the cf user.  There are plenty of other services out there for the non coder.</p><p>The reason im excited about this release is the css improvements.  Its dificult to do a custom layout right now and follow the upgrade path at the same time.  CSS improvements will hopefully change this.</p><p>Maybe a better way to promote and distribute the pods or skins we've all written would be nice.  I never think of combing through galleon to see whats out there.  If there was a pod directory maybe people would be more inclined to share their cusomizations.</p></div>

However - I mentioned above how I need more docs for layout crap. If I told people where all this stuff was, it would make it easier to make changes like that.</p><p>Raphael: I'm not quite sure I get what you mean.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, the big change I need is another tier in between the underlying logic tier and the presentation tier. Right now you have too much logic in the actual presentation code, determining if to display comments or to say there are none, building title strings dynamically, and so on. This makes it very difficult to use BlogCFC but to use a completely different presentation layer (as I do, so that it fits it to the rest of the site better). Ideally, your presentation code should be just that presentation. Need comments? Make a call and get them, or get the message to display if there are none, and so on. That would make life much simpler each time I update to a newer version of your code.</p><p>Oh, and Happy Bday!</p><p>--- Ben</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, what i'm building is a portal for a closed community. There will be approx. 15.000 users and every user will have its own blog (along with other tools). Users can post new entries to their blog as well as read entries from other users blogs. They all share the same database, layout and settings. I would really like to use BlogCFC for the blog-part of that portal, because i love it. However, it wouldn't be that easy/maintainable to have 15.000 different client-folders...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, for layout/presentation layer separation, what about doing something like joomla/mamba (php CMS system) do in their templates? Each piece of a page has a unique name. The template page (index.php) is a basic html page (using css layout, table layout, or whatever you want), with a single line call for each unique output piece. For example, you would have something like this:<br>&lt;code&gt;<br>&lt;div id="header"&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules('header'); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div id="maincontent"&gt;<br>  &lt;div id="newsflash"&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules('newsflash'); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>  &lt;div id="contentarea"&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules('content'); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/code&gt;</p><p>So I guess my idea is to transform the main index.cfm into a simple html page (a complete, xhtml-compliant page) scattered with a few cfinclude tags or cf function calls. This would allow someone (a newbie?) to edit the page in a Dreamweaver-type program to modify the layout without having to modify html code scattered throughout several different, sometimes obscure files. The other idea, also based off mambo/joomla, would be to create a templates subdir, with a subfolder for any template (or skin) that would include an index.cfm for the layout and any supporting css/image files. Then create a new setting to allow the admin user to change which template is in use. We could then create a community of templates that could simply be dropped-in (unzip the folder in the template subdir).</p><p>These are just some brainstorm ideas. I know this would be quite a bit different than how things are done in the 4.x release, but it would provide several benefits:<br>* allow easier minor-dot-version upgrades because we could have a layout file that doesn't change (or doesn't change much)<br>* allow those that want css-layout to do that, but still easily allow those silly people that may want table-based layout to remain archaic ;-)<br>* allow non-CF people an easier way to manipulate the presentation output because they can load a single file in Dreamweaver and edit it</p><p>Mark</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>love your work, and i have a few suggestions for you...</p><p>- how about a comments rss feed? one general one, and one for each post. Maybe one for the threads I am subscribed to?<br>- I also 2nd itcoder's suggestion of friendly category urls.<br>- I would prefer no JS dependency too.<br>- a html editor for writing posts? I really don't like the paragraphFormat() approach used at the moment. I've removed it from my own blog.<br>- Say i wanted your CF posts from jan 06. I would have to go to either your CF category and click "next page" to find the ones from jan 06, or go to jan 06 and then filter them by hand. Could we have categories where you can browse around a bit better? Search in a category, look at category posts from a certain date etc?</p><p>Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A lot of positive feedback it seems!</p><p>For the admin section, things like removing posts, and possibly, work in progress? I used blogspot/blogger before and I was able to write a few posts, that I needed to add more info into and save them without publishing them? That would be real neat.</p><p>Many thanks for your contributions Ray, this is an awesome bit of software and just getting better all the time!</p><p>MD</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mark: Removing posts (deleting) will obviously be supported. Works in progress (drafts) will be supported, and actually shouldl be done this week. I'm just going to use a 'Published' flag. Then there will be a link in the left hand nav, Drafts, to show entries with that flag=false.</p><p>Gavin: I can't imagine subscribing to a comments feed, but I know other blogs have it. I'll consider it. HTML Editor - everyone in the world wants this but me. ;) So I'm considering it at least. If I do put one in, or support for one, it will be turned off by default, but I'll consider it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,<br>I'd have to agree with Roger Benningfield suggestion of having something like @src="[attachment]" to allow you to insert an image into the body of the post at that location.</p><p>As for an avg user, well for every picture that a user uploads you could automatically generate the text to insert for each image (allowing for multiple images too) eg:</p><p>@src="[attachment1]"<br>@src="[attachment2]"</p><p>A user can then just copy and paste that text into the location of their choosing. Then you could parse over the file and replace it with the image tags on saving.</p><p>If you wanted to got down the JS path you could do a right click picker, and then still just insert the text code @src="[attachment1]"  ??</p><p>Cheers Ray</p><p>Pete</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 2 cents after working with the product for a while</p><p>1) Image includes:  I had to deal with this to o, and i just did a simple if statement to check if the files extension was a gif, jpg or png. If it was i just dumped the file at the bottom of the post.  I think that would be sufficient for 99%.</p><p>2) specific category subscriptions: make it easy for people to subscribe only to specific categories.  I wrote some code already to do this (i can send it in), but i will admit it semi-sucks, and the method i used is overly complex.</p><p>3) admin approval system: I would love to see a way to allow multiple users to post to the blog but require approval.  And then only admins could approve them.  This doesn't seem technically difficult, and i wouldn;t mind working on it.</p><p>4) html editors: I really DONT think we need fckeditor or full editors.  The only thing i really need is: bold, italics, underline, and make a link.  Thats it. I think everything else will just confuse novice posters.  (im developing for people used to ms word)</p><p>In any case, i am excited about the new version, and can't wait for updates!</p></div>
