		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was trying to figure a way to show an alert before submitting a form and I looked a flex docs and flash docs and I knew it was a simple command but didn't know what the command was or it's syntax. I went to ASFusion and the site was down... when it came back online I downloaded some customized alert articles and found in the comments from Laura... just add _root.submitForm(); to the function... blam! problem solved</p></div>
