		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was actually able to import all of my Sunbird events to my Google calendar, then delete the original calendar from Sunbird and create a new calendar that simply subscribes to the Google calendar (that I just imported).  I didn't really expect it to work quite so flawlessly, but it went off without a hitch.  Now I have one calendar that I can maintain from two locations.  Nifty.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Google Calendar only syncs one way, which explains Jason's problem above.</p><p>i.e. Google Calendar is "read only". You can't create events in Sunbird or Lightning or iCal and have them automatically created online. This is really an irritation and I would have expected much more from the folks at Google.</p><p>If you want an online calendar that you can read from and write to, I would suggest <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ficalx.com%3AyfIygZ9Q5AS7IgG6mdo6CK6oGu4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="icalx.com">icalx.com</a>. The only drawback is that it's more complex to setup.</p></div>
