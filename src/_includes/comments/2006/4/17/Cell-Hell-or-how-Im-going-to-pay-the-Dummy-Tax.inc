		<div class="comment_text"><p>All phones/carriers are different, but I had insurance on my Blackberry and it broke.  I thought I could go in and just pick up a new one since I had insurance.  Not quite.  They were going to charge me a $200 insurance deductible to replace my phone (same model).  I opted to pay $250 to just purchase the newer model of the phone.</p><p>So make sure you read exactly how the insurance works.  This was insurance through T-Mobile.  I ended up just canceling the insurance since my so called deductible was basically the exact same amount as purchasing a new phone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Update:</p><p>So thanks Joel for giving me the idea to call Cingular. They did a LOT for me:</p><p>a) They repeated the thing about me needing to buy a new phone, and how I should wait till the 27th, but said they would move the deal up to today. (No waiting.)</p><p>b) The local store said I'd need to spend 249 and get a two year contract. (Then minus 50 bucks with a mail in rebate. Cingular on the phone offered me the phone for 169, 80 bucks cheaper (and that's also BEFORE the 50 dollar rebate)</p><p>c) I thought I was agreeing to two years ON TOP of my contract. I don't change phones often but I was worried about agreeing to a 4 year deal. Turns out I was wrong. It's two years starting from today.</p><p>d) I pay 10 bucks shipping and an 18 dollar xfer fee.</p><p>All together, I'm VERY happy with the deal Cingular gave me on the phone. I'm going to look into insurance too once it gets here. They said it would be 3 business days, but as my readers know, the mail here sucks since Rita/Katrina. Although it should still be better than me waiting till the 27th.</p><p>Oh! And if I do find my phone, as long as it's within 30 days, I can return the new one.</p><p>Seeet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I work at a small cellular company and I've got to tell you that no carrier will just give you a new phone if you lost without insurance.  Every carrier eats a portion of the phone cost up front as long as you sign a 2 year agreement.  So there's no way they're going to eat it again.  Insurance ranges from $3 to $5 depending on your carrier and the deductibles will vary according to the phone, just like an automobile.  I hate to say it, but it sounds like you might be a little screwed.  Larger companies won't work with you as much either when it comes to situtations like that, especially if you're not even a year under contract.  Sorry for your luck</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, I'm glad you finally got your phone situation resolved, however, I feel for you.  I just encountered pretty much the same problem tow days ago.  I've had my raz v3 for under 30 days and it appears as though it either dropped out of my bag or someone took it right out of my bag.  In any case, I did call it and someone picked up, said "hello" and then hung up on me.  I tried calling in insurance after but cingular wasn't allowing that.  I, too have never, ever lost a phone and I've been carrying one for at least 8-9 years. It happens! I have to suck it up and purchase a new one at full price!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,</p><p>If you are shopping for insurance you should check out quotes. There are free online quotes in the internet wherein you can compare rates side by side. I recently checked quotes  at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.insurancepaylite.com%3Ab0g5YycqHzevaX3ujt8hUZ8A4M4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.insurancepaylite.com">www.insurancepaylite.com</a> they have fast quoting system, They’re using an auto coverage analyzer where you have to answer a few question about your financial standing, automobile condition, etc. From this information it will generate what category of coverage you need.</p></div>
