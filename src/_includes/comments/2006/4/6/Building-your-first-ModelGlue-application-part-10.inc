		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I know you get a lot of praise for the code and apps you publish here, but I have to say that it's incredibly generous of you, not to mention brave and honest, to walk people through an app build like this with a technology that by your own admission you are not yet fully au fait with. I'm sure most of us would decline from doing what you've done, too afraid of making a mistake and opening ourselves up to public ridicule. All credit to you.</p><p>It's great to have apps like this, and like Brian K's bookstore app and Sean C's framework comparison example, as well as Eddie Awad's MG FAQ and the other resources out there, all for use as guides and references.</p><p>Many thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks guys. To be honest, I'm both happy I did and happy it's done (minus the Summary piece). It was fun. Of course, now I get to focus on looking at contest submissions. I'm also considering a series of small "Friday CF Puzzlers".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd like to echo the sentiments of the others. Thanks Ray.</p><p>You mentioned at one point, "If you scan back up the page, you saw that I returned a new result, passwordGallery, if the user needs to authenticate," but I didn't see it in the code example. I assume it belongs in the final elseif of the security check.</p><p>I'm also not completely sure what append="id" is for in the result tags in the new event handlers.</p><p>One last thing, there's a potentially embarassing typo of 'public' just above the 4th code example. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oops. I meant that the result was passwordGallery.</p><p>append="id" means: Fire a new event, but be sure to pass along the event argument id.</p><p>pubic? I'm ok with that. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I know you have heard this many times, but well done.</p><p>This tutorial was very helpful, in depth and easy to understand.</p><p>I did read parts 1 - 3 a couple of weeks back and found the concept of MG difficult to understand and thus didn't gain much out of the tutorials.</p><p>However, several weeks later, especially after working on a CF OOP project, I came back and spent almost a full day reading this tutorial and practicing the MG framework, I  now feel alot more comfortable with MG, which has been something I have been interested in learning every since reading about CF frameworks a couple of months back.</p><p>This is all thanks to you mate.</p><p>I congratulate you on this excellent piece of helpful witting.</p></div>
