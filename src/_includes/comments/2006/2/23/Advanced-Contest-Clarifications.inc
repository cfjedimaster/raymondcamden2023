		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just wondering.</p><p>I was just introduced to your site today, so I have not spent much time on it. So if this is a stupid question, feel free to mock.</p><p>But I was wondering who won the other contests? Where thier code is so I could see how folks do things. I taught Coldfusion to myself, (not a preferred method) so I would like to see how others do things.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I don't care that it's not straight-up CF... if I had a decent Flex 2 beta IDE available I'd go for it.</p><p>It's the fact that you're *requiring* Flex 2 and I'm one of the many Mac users that Adobe hasn't chosen to grace with ANY available IDE *or* SDK. I'd have to install the SDK on Windows, find all the relevant files, move them back to my Mac, figure out how to write MXML by hand, then how to use the compiler...</p><p>Anyway, I'm not saying you shouldn't do the contest this way, I'm just letting you know why a) you very likely won't see an entry from me in this particular contest and b) why so many people were annoyed. You've basically summarily excluded a bunch of us by dictating an immature technology that isn't available on a heavily used platform.</p><p>Again... I *get* that you're not looking for high-end Flex, and that some were crabby about it because "this isn't a ColdFusion contest then" (which is a load of crap, really). *MY* particular problem is the absolute requirement that Flex 2 be used because the frigging SDK isn't even available to me at this point and doesn't look like it will be for months.</p><p>HTH,<br>J</p></div>
