		<div class="comment_text"><p>Around a month to learn a completely new product...</p><p>As much as I would love to enter the contest, I doubt I'll have time to do that right now with how full my plate is at work.  The backend ColdFusion log parsers, data storage and report generation would be hard enough to complete and debug in a month without having to learn how to build the frontend with Flex 2 and tie it into the backend services.</p><p>You are definitely setting the bar high and slanting the contest a little bit away from ColdFusion with the mandatory use of Flex 2 as the frontend piece.  You could provide a very good frontend using DHTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In a lot of ways the most difficult ColdFusion aspects will be independent of the frontend used to present the parsed.</p><p>I do understand the rules with the inclusion of the Flex Builder product as one of the prizes, but it does make it tougher on those of us who haven't had the time to check out the beta products yet or don't have a compatible operating system.  I might still give it a shot and build the ColdFusion aspects first, then see if I have any time left to put a Flex frontend on the application.</p><p>That is certainly a very nice list of prizes :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few questions for you regarding desired functionality:</p><p>1.) Elaborate on what you meant when you said "work in with log file viewing in the ColdFusion administrator".</p><p>2.) Which logs do you want this to allow you to view, parse and report on, just the default system generated logs?  I would assume that is the initial scope and should not try to take into account user created application logs which can vary a bit in format and information contained in the logs.</p><p>I may have more questions as I think about the application.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jason: I understand your view. I can say that I will NOT be expecting high quality Flex work - just high quality back end work.</p><p>Az: If you go to your cf admin, you will see two types of files, CFML and... I forget the other type. But the CFML files have a standard format. You get the same file if you use cflog. My point is to say you don't have to parse ANY kind of file, just the standard CFML log file.</p><p>So to your second question, I do mean user generated log files, but only those made with cflog, as they will follow the same format. Make sense?</p><p>Rob: Understood. These contests are successful I'd say. There is certainly no reason why I can't run more later in the year.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll add my voice to the disappointment about requiring Flex 2 - and the timeline. I'd been looking forward to the "advanced" contest thinking I might actually have a go at it myself but given the requirements there's no way I'll be able to take part. As a *busy* Mac user I've essentially let Flex 2 pass me by since there's no Mac version of Flex Builder and I don't fancy learning a new tag-based language without the support of an IDE.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - I think Flex 2 is great technology! I'm looking forward to learning it when Flex Builder becomes available for OS X.</p><p>Maybe you'll consider a *ColdFusion* advanced contest at some point?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, that makes sense.  Thanks for the information and I'll see just how much time I can squeeze in to work on the project.  I actually think the ColdFusion coding for your intermediate contest might have been a bit more involved than the coding involved to meet your minimum specs for this contest, especially with the time frame on that contest.  I might change my mind once I have time to look into this a bit more however... :)</p></div>

I'd freely admit I'm a bit rusty in that area... :)</p><p>Another question, should the application be non-destructive with regards to the log files (i.e.leave the plain text log files in place and viewable through the standard log viewer)?  Or is that left up to the individual developer?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>as far as the Flex requirement...</p><p>while it may -technically- mean it's no longer -just- a "CF" contest, I think it's a good thing to motivate people to learn a new technology.</p><p>we've all got tight deadlines at work and personal/family responsibilities.

And truth be told, if the contest hadn't come along (or didn't have the Flex requirement), I don't know when or if I would have checked Flex out.</p><p>Personally, I'm grateful for the opportunity and I'm looking forward to it.</p><p>charlie</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This weekend I received a Flex Beta1 CD along with my Java Developer Journal magazine (I'm not sure how I got subscribed to that one. Funny how I got that with JDJ and not CFDJ) I'm looking at the "Build a Flex App in 15 minutes" video on the Labs site and they say the Flex Builder app is an Eclipse plug in... good thing I recently learned how to set that up.</p></div>
