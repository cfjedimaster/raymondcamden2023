		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congratulations on the huge usage of Galleon and BlogCFC!  I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that we all need to do our part to ramp up the number of available open source CF applications.  I and some other developers and designers are currently working on BoardFusion to be a vBulletin/phpBB comeptitor (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boardfusion.com%3AB1NekNwJyodcaYk-oZhc8Ijek1k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.boardfusion.com">http://www.boardfusion.com</a>) and it will be released under the Apache 2.0 license.  In addition, Peter Farrell and I are working on MachBlog (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.machblog.org%3A72QyZ2LQxMCE56RcErSfk3AwijA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.machblog.org">http://www.machblog.org</a>) and my CFUG (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dfwcfug.org%3AfSyeZFiF_CNnmdsuk76ZwVVVFBk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dfwcfug.org">http://www.dfwcfug.org</a>) is collaboratively working on a user group app, and both of these apps will be released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p><p>It's going to take some time to get there, but I think this effort is very important to the community in numerous ways.  I also completely agree with your "just do it" sentiment.  If there's a need out there, try and fill it!  You'll be amazed at what kind of help you can get on projects if you just ask.</p><p>Thanks again for all you do for the community Ray--you definitely lead the charge where all of this is concerned.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice Ray!</p><p>Congrats!</p><p>You know.... one of my clients wanted to set up a survey tool. What came to my mind was using Soundings and going from there with what they needed.</p><p>But, they decided to buy some software... desktop app, submitting to a .NET webapp..</p><p>It runs very well, I don't want to pretend it doesn't.. but the major problem that I've seen is that in their purchase they lost the "customizability" (I'm not sure if that's a word.. but I'll pretend it is) that they seemed to want.</p><p>I've worked with them to try to adapt other dbs with it... went through the tech support... and in the end spent quite a bit of time for nothing... ;-)</p><p>And, they're back to using the software within the specific workings of the app.. The big advantage of course that I see OpenSource stuff benefitting an organization like theirs is in customizing.</p><p>And they may have paid about the same with something that is tailored to their needs and can always be changed...</p><p>Anyways.. I'm almost ranting... because I've just spent many hours in this thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>First, congratulations!</p><p>Second, wouldn't it be nice to get a dollar an instance :)?</p><p>Galleon is a great forum.  Why?  Because it is simple to use and simple to implement, not to mention fast and free.  I actually paid for a copy of FuseTalk a couple of years ago when I first stumbled across CF and I haven't used it yet. My thought was "If it's good enough for Macromedia..."  It is a very powerful forum, but it is too complicated for most websites and from my experience it is too slow.  Having looked at phpBB, I noticed there are a number of similarities with FuseTalk (could be innovation).</p><p>I found this quote that I think is fitting:</p><p>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent.  It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction.  ~E.F. Schumacker</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I definetely think thats possible. I have seen many people taking BlogCFC and putting a new shape and sould to it. Personally , I think if we can get together and try some hard core development on BOLGCFC, we can very well compete with Wordpress.For example, Changing Themes, Adding for fucntionality on a mere press of button AKA Plugins..etc.</p><p>FYI: Check out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3Awww.sirajsayeed.com%3ALSYBuK0JIVxtEEnw_1k2_QtwwuU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http:www.sirajsayeed.com">http:www.sirajsayeed.com</a> where he have used BlogCFC and gave a different look to it.He have used some cool PODS which uses some AJAX stuff as well. I think he is soon going to release code for download as well ( I hope)..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you again Ray. Blog CFC and Galleon have really been great, they are simple, yet have enough features to get the job done. I can't wait to see what you (and the rest of us in the community) come up with next.</p></div>
