Many dealing with him, but several democrats should be run out of office too.  Makes me wish 'wacking day' from the Simpsons was a real day.  Get yourself a stick and wack some snakes.</p><p>I say we start a Flickr site of polititions that actually deserve to be in office. (that we all agree on) It would be hard, and the list of photos pretty small.  Also start a flickr site of evil polititians, and then see which one gets more views.  Popularity meters like that are pretty popular.</p><p>We all know evil side will win...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is kind of amusing watching the White House press core asking stupid questions like, "Why did it take so long?"  Or, "Do you think the VP will submit a letter of resignation?" &lt;&lt;  That person should be smacked.</p><p>One headline from the papers was, "Duck!  It's Dick!"</p><p>I support Bush/Cheney, but i'm no Clinton Kool-Aid drinker type,  I do do have my grudges.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The story has stuck because it is part of a larger "storyline", which has less to do with the accident itself than with the attempt to hide this from the public. The storyline is an administration that doesn't believe you have the right to information. Then, when they supply information, it is disinformation, blame the victim, smear and fear, etc. Despite the fact that it isn't an overtly political story, it still fits into all of the overarching storylines...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What was there to hide?  The VP's office couldn't have been that stupid in thinking that people weren't going to find out about it.  Should they have gone and notified the press core first - who's to say?  In this age of technology the story was going to spread like fire anyway.  This just shows the true liberal side of the media.</p><p>I also think the WH press core (and the big networks) is a little pissed because they didn't know first.</p></div>

Perhaps this shouldn't be about Cheney, but about what the victim's wishes.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was noted on the news (of course) this morning that Cheney hasn't give a press conference... for anything... since 2002.  If true... what would it say if he gave a press conference about this while he's had no comments regarding wars, hurricanes, etc.</p><p>While celebrities and politicans are expected to accept that their personal lives are going to be made into press fodder, they don't OWE anyone anything.  Most of them don't choose to talk about many things until idiocy like this pretty much forces them to.</p><p>The public is only made aware of certain things because of the press.  If the press didn't get the scoop on Saturday, then too bad.</p><p>Also, I'm hearing it was also the family who owned the property taking time out to figure out how best to release the info.</p><p>Can you blame them?  Look at the reaction.  I think if it had come out on Saturday people would still find some reason to be peeved about it.</p><p>I'm with you.  Sick to death of it.  There are more important things to rag on the gov't about, repub or dem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan, doesn't your comment presume to know that the victim wished to keep this quiet? 1) If you heard this, I'd like your inside sources. 2) The vice-president shot someone. By accident or not, this is definitely newsworthy. For gods-sake, Clinton's BJ was news for years...and this was cheared on by the right and the supposedly "liberal" media.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh, and it wasn't "Clinton's BJ" that was the issue, it was that as a sitting President, he purjured himself by intentionally giving false testimony in a Grand Jury investigation. But, since the Grand Jury was about the Paula Jones case ('just sex'), it didn't matter that Clinton lied, because it's OK to lie about sex.</p><p>Let's not forget that Clinton was subseqently disbarred in Arkansas. He's got the distinction of being the only President to be disbarred! Bravo!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>well it's the first time in recent memory that a VP shot somebody (i suppose back in the early years of the US, they shot folks w/some regularity). that's news no matter what. the fact they he was hunting w/out a license is news too. if it was back home in PA, the game wardens would have had him in handcuffs. in PA hunting/fishing licenses are a big deal, so him not having one was kind of shocking to me. the fact that he didn't have one &amp; they're being so casual about it speaks volumes. the rules apply to everybody or they apply to nobody.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Johnny -</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised that a particular media outlet (paper, cable channel, etc) has a bias. The newspaper you work for may be a good example of that, and it seems obvious that Fox leans heavily towards the GOP, and that MSNBC leans the other way. But media as a whole does not exhibit a bias one way or the other. No more than the public at large does.</p></div>

Now, does this mean that the networks get together each night in the news rooms and say "How can we be biased tonight?"</p><p>Read the book BIAS by Bernard Goldberg, who worked at CBS news for 20+ years. He does an awesome job of covering bias, how it comes about and TONS of examples of factual events and how they are eventually packaged and reported with a BIAS.
