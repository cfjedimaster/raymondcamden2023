		<div class="comment_text"><p>CFAdvisor was the first online CF magazine. Judith was their editor for a while (at peanuts) before we branched off on our own to Fusion Authority. They sank slowly and were gobbled up by CFDJ for their subscriber list. CFDJ was going to keep them running but they vanished really fast.</p></div>
