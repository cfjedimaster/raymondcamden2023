		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you've piqued my curiosity. As a step-father and leading a support group of special needs children (80% divorce rate), the concepts of "father" and "dad" come up frequently.</p><p>I said "birth father" because I figure it is less ambiguous than "real father." The man that was present at 3 of my children's births, and responsible for some of their dna, left when the youngest of those 3 was one, and now participates in their lives about 36 hours out of the year. I am their "step father" but also their "real father."</p><p>Now, I have personally used the word "father" to mean the dna guy while using the term "dad" to refer to the significant, loving male figure in the child's life. But I have run into many people that did the opposite.</p><p>As an adoptive parent, what terms do you use?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Egyptian hieroglyphs spell a real Ancient Egyptian word, namely the verb "TO KILL" (causative version of the word "death"). There is a post all about this in the official Lost plot forum, along with a picture from an Ancient Egyptian - English dictionary. Apparently if you freezeframe the picture you can see the missing symbol from the word spinning by at one point.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>FOR ALL YOU NEEDING TO KNOW WHAT THE heiroglyphics ARE</p><p>If You Have A Mack Computer or Can Get to one there are things called "widgets" and they are at a place called "Safari" a type of website were you can download these widgets. One of the widget is called a lost widget. It has the timer and the computer and you press the buttun like on lost. Once the 108 min. time out it turns to the heiroglyphics and you can see clearly what they are. I cannot translate it but mabye someone out there can. Good Luck</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My only question now is the red and black colouring of the blocks that the letters are written on. I read something on a wiki somewhere that it was a way of categorizing the gardner symbols somehow. Could there be something to do with the spacing between the first three and the last two symbols? My theory is that the first set is something along the lines of an effect or "what will happen" (for lack of a better phrase, and the last two symbols are a solution to the matter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that the symbols say "It Dies" meaning that the test subjects will all DIE.  My Theory is that the OTHERS are in fact the results of testing being carried out on the island.  I think that there is in fact 3 bases where the scientist carried out the testing on the OTHERS.  We have seen 2 of them and the OTHERS hold the 3rd which is the key to the success of the island.  This is why they are taking children to ensure that there station is always ALIVE.  If the clock is not reset then the Island will kill all those that walk on it. and start the project again</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As soon as I saw them I knew the symbols were hieroglyphs.  I knew the first was an 'S' and the fourth was an 'A', but I couldn't find the others in my book.  The third could have been a biltiral - the others are uniliterals - that could mean 'nm' or 'dja'.  'nm' or similar glyphs are usually made into words by adding an 'e' or other vowel between the letters; so 'nm' would be 'nem'.  The others could be versions of hieroglyphs such as hieratic, the running-writing equivalent.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>QUOTED: "...and guys, stop saying what the second glyph is cuz it never shows it."</p><p> In the latest episode, "Live together, Die alone" you DO see the second symbol. It's a curly-cue that looks a lot like an "e".</p><p>  If you don't believe me, watch last night's episode here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2F%3A3MPRlAd-_J3_PQVAVMQhzaIGnXs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://abc.go.com/">http://abc.go.com/</a></p><p>  I looked up the "e"-like symbol and found it can easily be interpreted as the number "100" in Egyptian Hieroglyphs - but frankly I have no idea what it really means in the show. And if you want to know what the symbols are for sure - look on the cover of the first Season DVD box set. It's right on the box cover, or at least that's where I think I remember seing them for the first time - before I even watched the show :)</p></div>

Seems everyone forgot he's the guy who had Sayid torture his own commanding officer so that Kelvin could find his captured American soldier. Remember? Kelvin handed Sayid a toolbox with a hammer and pliers, and after Sayid came back to tell him that his American soldier was buried, he was dropped off in the middle of nowhere with black billowing smoke in the background. Anyone remember now? It was in the episode named "One Of Them" :D</p></div>
