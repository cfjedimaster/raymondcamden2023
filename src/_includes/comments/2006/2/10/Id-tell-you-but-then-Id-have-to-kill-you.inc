		<div class="comment_text"><p>MJ,</p><p>I'm not sure how Mayor Nagin's response, or lack thereof, has any bearing on why the White House doesn't want people testifying before Congress.  Somehow, it's Mr. Nagin's rear end they want to protect.  If the Administration has nothing to be ashamed of (and no, I'm not saying that you believe that either), then why are they instructing officials to not testify before Congress?</p><p>I never believed the stories that people in the Superdome were being raped and murdered, and I was glad to find out that those stories were largley debunked.  I also never claimed nor inferred that the Federal response had anything to do with people's race.  Let me quote you, quoting me,</p><p>&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think the terrorists already do have a pretty clear idea of how we respond to a disaster. The answer is simple - if it's in a wealthy area, or a critical swing state in an election year, we respond quickly.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I voted for Bush. I support many of his policies, but feel that many other policies (some of which are not Bush's, but general GOP policies) are wrong, and some downright dangerous (immigration, for one).</p><p>With that said, this Katrina hearing is nothing but a witch hunt. Perhaps there will be a few good points discovered to better help manage a situation like this in the future, but this is 100% predictable. It's nothing more than a way for the media to pile on the Bush admin.</p><p>People forget that the federal gov't is a LAST RESORT resource and that local and state govt's are front-line resources. New Orelans is the EPITOME of what a liberal-run entitlement state is like. Complete lack of accountability at all levels of local and state gov't.</p><p>One thing you WON'T hear discussed in detail at these hearings is where the millions and millions of dollars went for "levy reinforcement" projects that were shelled out in the Clinton and Bush years. New Orleans could have been some much better prepared if the state and local gov'ts were run by competent officials that didn't point the finger at Bush and the Feds.</p><p>It's a crying shame when someone like Louis Farahkan is given more credence and respect for claiming the levies were "blown up" than a sitting President. But thats the US media for you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My opinion on "confidential stuff".  If they say it is "confidential" then it is "confidential".  Unfortunaltly, Disaster Response is something that is becoming more common today.  Last time I checked Disaster Response does not only include Hurricanes......I think terrorist attacks fully qualify as a disaster.</p><p>Point being it is all about our security.  If these people think that it will compromise our security by disclosing information about discussions and documents....by all means keep them hidden!!</p><p>I think this all stems from the lack of leadership from Mayor and Governor.  Boy oh boy that Nagin sure knows how to speak in the public.</p><p>Just my $0.02.</p></div>

Sorry 'bout that...<br>------------------</p><p>Hi Alex,</p><p>One of the most interesting - and for a while, I thought the most compelling - talking points that the Administration used in its defense - that the Federal Government is the service of last resort in an emergency and that the federal government cannot be mobilized until the Govenor declares a state of emergency.</p><p>Now, if the govenor hadn't declared a state of emergency until after the storm hit New Orleans, then the way things played out would have made more sense (at least to me, anyways).</p><p>It turns out, however, that the Govenor Blanco declared a state of emergency on Friday, August 26, two days before the storm's major damage occurred on the 28th:</p><p>(spaces inserted in the URL for the sake of page layout)<br>http:// <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.state.la.us%2F%3AFRGiqtxeQgbKepZNzApO_iIM50Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.gov.state.la.us/">www.gov.state.la.us/</a> index.cfm ?md=newsroom &amp;tmp=detail &amp;catID=1 &amp;articleID=776 &amp;navID=3</p><p>(hey folks, the Govenor's web site uses ColdFusion, cool!)</p><p>Now, my understanding of the law is that once a govenor declares an emergency, the Federal Government takes over and becomes the primary agency. So in this case, FEMA was the first responder to the scene.</p><p>Keep in mind that I'm not saying that there weren't failures at the state and local levels (Corruption in New Orleans? I'm shocked, I tell ya, shocked!). What I am saying is that FEMA was the agency in charge at the time and now the White House doesn't want its officials talking to congress about it.</p><p>A Republican controlled congress, too, which I think is very strange.</p><p>Best,<br>Chris</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know why there is all this negativity here regarding Pres Bush.  However, the responses that the Senate wants are to merely justify their political ends in a finger-pointing political witch hunt in order to find out who the scapegoat should be for what happened with Katrina.  Which basically means that it won't happen.</p><p>As appropriately noted in Don's post above, the first responders for any disaster are first local authorities (city gov't), then State authorities, and if they can't handle it, the federal gov't.  By the way, the federal government augments the state and local authorities.  They (the federal gov't) don't "own" the show.  Besides, take a comparison between NY and NOLA and you will see that the two handled their respective disasters in two very different ways.  NY=professional.  NOLA=Disastrous.  Of course, everybody wants to blame Pres Bush when they should've been pointing their fingers at Blanco and Nagin, two very incompetent people who were woefully inadequate for the job.  In my opinion, NOLA reminds me of a good South American country because of all the graft and corruption and the lack of someone with the cojones to take charge or responsibility for the "response" to what happened there.  Besides, when you are handed a job that's been pooch-screwed and all messed up, it is often very difficult to clean up after very incompetent peoples' messes.  Even so, if my memory serves me correctly, Pres Bush did warn Louisiana to do something to prepare for the hurricane and they did it in a halfassed, lackadaisical, typical mardi-grasish manner and got caught with their pants down (or in Nawlins' case with it's shirt up begging for beads).  And speaking of the dikes, I really think that Louisiana should be paying back all of the federal taxpayers' money that they took and used elsewhere instead of reinforcing the dikes like they were supposed to with my tax dollars and yours too.</p><p>At least Pres Bush takes responsibility for his actions and doesn't try to hide behind anything.  The bottom-line for NOLA is you can take a horse to water but you can't force it to drink.  Or better suited to "stupid is as stupid does."  Also, unless you've ever worked a disastrous situation in some capacity before consider your opinion duly noted.  And yes, I've earned my t-shirt elsewhere and still do in the military, and no, I can't tell you where I've worked before because I would have to cut your head off and place it in a safe and declare it classified material TS/SCI/NonYerBizness not releasable until head is desiccated/mummified.<br>Tom</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that the reason the reponse to Katrina was so terrible starts with the local govt. Let's take a look at the facts, the Gulf Coast gets smacked around every year by hurricanes especially Florida. Alabama got nailed a few times, not just on the coast but right through the middle of the state. Now what makes the response in those states different than the response in NOLA, one word .. leadership. I didn't see Blanco until she was touring the area with Bush, but I'll see Jeb on TV as soon as they even think a hurricane is going to pass near Florida. It doesn't matter that Blanco is a Democrat, female, etc or that Jeb is a Republican, male, brother of the President etc. What matters is how they plan for and respond to crisis situations.</p><p>Every programmer should follow the principle of "Plan your work then work your plan" and for govt. it is a must. The hard truth if the matter is that Blanco and Nagin failed to execute the plan they had in place. They chose instead to throw their hands in the air and hope the Feds would save them but unlike the unfortunate citizens stranded on top of their houses, Blanco and Nagin had a way out.</p></div>

Bragg after whom they named the SF Training center.</p><p>Jim,<br>Who said anything about bragging anyway.  A security clearance is more restrictive than one would think and even more so than a NDA when you consider that it costs about $60,000 for a background investigation just to make sure the person can have a clearance before they ever hold one, and all you do with a NDA is sign a piece of paper.  Besides, I'm not very worried about leaks coming from people bragging about their clearance because I know they at least understand the importance of what they are guarding.  I am more worried about the Politicians and their lackeys who consistently think they are above the rules when it comes to classified material and take it out of the protected environment or let loose with loose lips and give up our secrets because they can't follow some simple rules to protect our information.</p><p>Tom</p></div>
