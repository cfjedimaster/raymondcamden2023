		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had some problems doing conference calls with people across the pond.  Mostly, just quality issues - sometimes the audio will drop, or speed up, or get jarbled in that robotic-like voice.  It gets frustrating when you're trying to discuss important topics, but better than paying long distance I guess.</p><p>As an aside, XBox Live is a good alternative to Skype.  :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've also become a real fan of Skype, have you checked out their SkypeIn service? It allows you to get an actual phone number in the UK, USA and a number other countries for a mere 30 USD a year so people can call you on a local number and you receive the call via Skype. It also comes with a free voice mail service, pretty cool stuff!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i've been using Skype since i moved from NOLA after Katrina. I got a NOLA area code SkypeIn number so the folks at the office could call me without long-distance charges. I also got some SkypeOut minutes and a Linksys Wireless Skype Phone (the Internet Telephony Kit).</p><p>Skype has been working great overall and it's nice to wander around the office and outside and not be tied to my computer headset. Haven't tried the video features in 2.0 yet though.</p><p>Might have to look into compiling a Flash dev Skype list... :-)</p><p>cheers<br>g.</p></div>
