		<div class="comment_text"><p>I still couldn't figure out about the end. Did Sawyer con the girl afterall? What was the deal with the car and stuff. I somewhat disagree about the plot. I think it progressed quite a bit. A major secret has finally been put out into the open about Sawyer being a con artist. Esp. with Charlie helping out. <br>Really enjoyed this weeks episode.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Did anyone notice that when Sawyer was in the diner that waitress that served him was Kate's mom?</p><p>I agree that it was a good episode, but kind of had no point. The most it did was divide the group. Though I could argue that Sawyer made them all come together because they were all being too suspicious of each other. I'm still waiting for some of the show to start exploring more of the mysteries of the island. There is so much they could be doing with that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't seen much of LOST, but it seems like it's a showcase for every conspiracy theory imaginable.<br>Not specific ones like "who shot JFK", but I can see the writers sitting around brainstorming.  "I know, how about a show where we allude to time travel, dream sequences, the island of Dr. Moreau, and anything else we can think of all at the same time?"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Robert - Thank you for helping me figure out where I saw her from!  It was her mom.  Good catch.  I don't remember seeing the black smoke in this episode (maybe some other forum has screenies).</p><p>I bet you that when the timer hits '0' that nothing will happen - Jack will make a comment to John and say, "See...nothing."  Then as the both of them look away - BAM!  Or the computer screen will start receiving transmissions from the other computer.</p><p>Yes, Sawyer did con the girl after all.  Sawyer said that his partner was in the car, but he really wasn't - it was Sawyer's car.  It was a diversion to get the girl out of the house.</p><p>The dewy-decimal system joke really cracked me up.  I'm just waiting for Sawyer to say, "My name is Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid Rock!"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>SPOILERS WITHIN!</p><p>It was more than that he just conned the girl. He also conned his partner. Instead of having to split the money with his partner, he ended up with all $600k.</p><p>I thought this episode was great! I totally fell into thinking it was Anna Lucia despite trying so hard to work it from a different angle.</p><p>I was uncomfortable with the Locke/Jack tension but I like it! I also like that Charlie had an opportunity to take back his statues and chose not to.</p><p>As for Hurley's time statement. That's a red herring. Too out there. Too obvious. Now, the training videos, if I recall correctly, did mention time experiments. The TV Guide interview said "time" was very important. However, I suspect that the broad is from WWII. Remember, the original discovery of the radio transmission was by a soldier at a listening station in WWII. So when Hurley says, "from another time" and "the signal is clear, must be close" it could be that the radio tower we haven't visited yet is broadcasting the music on a loop in the same way the numbers were on a loop and that the music is from WWII, ergo, "another time."</p><p>I like how almost every flashback has included another cast member in the background or in somewhy tied the survivors together. Kate's mom was subtle!</p><p>"There's a new sheriff in town!" Totally changes the dynamic of the group now and leaves them relatively defenseless if they are attacked.</p><p>Where have we seen Sawyer's partner before?</p><p>As for the counter hitting 0, I bet that will happen in the last second of the next episode and we will be left hanging. And don't forget that the directors in an interview said that in Feb we will find out why Hurley isn't losing weight.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think Hurley being comic relief is starting to say things that crazy internet theories are talking about. I think that was a jab at us addicts. There was another one by him the other day, but I forgot what it was.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, silly question - don't know if I dreamt this, when Locke asked Sawyer his name in the previous episode he said it was James something. The surname sounded like "Forta", I listened to it a couple of times and I'm sure that's what it sounded like.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Regarding the counter reaching zero...  I don't think the counter shown in the preview is actually *the* counter.  The counter that counts down from 108 minutes in the show consists of three black background digits (the minutes) and two white bacground digits (the seconds).  The counter shown at '0' in the preview was only three black background digits.  I may be nuts, but I'm thinking it just a teaser.</p></div>
