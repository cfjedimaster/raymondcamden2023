		<div class="comment_text"><p>Avoid HP. My boss bought one maybe 3 months ago and for 2 of those months it's been shipped back and forth to HP.  They finally sent a 'new' (refurbished) one to replace it. We'll see how long it lasts.</p><p>I just bought a Lenovo (ThinkPad) before Xmas and have had outstanding service and support.  I ordered one online then called to see when it would ship (was hoping to get it before Xmas) and the sales person was extra helpful, informed me the model I had ordered was out of stock but then helped me pick another model that had better features and was something like $10 cheaper.   I also ordered a docking station which when shipped was missing the power cord. Called and instead of making me get an RMA and ship everything back - they simply drop shipped me a replacement cord - no cost.</p><p>And so far I'm very happy with the model I bought (Z60m) - good battery life, decent screen and it doesn't weigh too much.</p><p>Jim</p></div>

I usually run several programs at the same time and I have no hipcops. My configuration is P4 Intel Centrino 1.8Mhz, 1Gig of RAM, 54G Wifi + Bluetooth, LiteScribe DVD Writer, 80Gig HD, Wireless Remote (for the DVD/MP3 Player) which tucks into the CF Card Slot. Its a very sweet machine.</p></div>

Wireless Networking works great and that's a big plus for me.  one problem, recently the screen has been flickering at certain tilt angles.  When I told dell support, they were about to send out a technician to work on it for free b/c it's still under warranty.  (I think I have the Small Business extended warranty).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>There could not be a worst time to buy a laptop than now. None of Intels laptop CPUs are 64bit, many brands are still transitioning memory from DDR to DDR2, and this 64bit issue also includes the new Intel Macs.</p><p>I wanted a new laptop but everything out there made me feel like I was making a horrible investment. So, I bought a Dell Inspiron B130 last week for $550. I am actually really impressed with it.</p><p>That is what I recommend, just make sure to get the 6-Cell battery for the extra life.</p><p>Douglas</p><p>Oh, and Intel plans on releasing 64bit laptop cores in the middle of this year!</p></div>
