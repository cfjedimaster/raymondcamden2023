		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the details of the show that I've never read an explanation for is what happens to Desmond (the previous occupant of the hatch) after he leaves the survivors' section of the island. He walks off, never to be heard from again, but I'm curious... what becomes of him? Where does he plan to go? Does he survive on his own, or do the Others take him? In other words, do the writers of the show plan to reintroduce him to the plot at some point in the future?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, about Desmond, and given that it is #3 in that theory, he was the only person to give "credibility" to the "must type in this number or you'll die" bullcrap. If you ask me, he's in on it. If it is a rats in a maze experiment after all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>hey there guys, just thought i'd give my two cents and say: I think that all the people in this series have really big issues, Kind of really big inner demons which they all have to take care of. This leads me to believe that all of the survivors are really not on an island, but are infact under hypnosis, and in some group theropy type senario. They are all able to experience the same things, because they can hear what everyone else can say, as well as what the hypnotheripist is saying. They all agreed to be part of this new type of theropy due to the really big troubles they all have, When people die, it is because they have resolved there problem in the case of the cute blonde chick (she wanted to be respected and independant) which i think she did before she died, As well as Walt who wanted his father around more and to understand him more ( I think he also acheived this and was taken off of the island).........I just think the whole black smoke thing is way too much to be believable in the real world, and this group hypnosis theropy is very justifiable. Anywho, i hope ya all get it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also I think the "flash backs" are when each cast member gets to tell the group about their past and what has brought them to their 'island" I also think that this hypnosis theory makes sense out of why Locke could for some reason walk on the island, even though he was paralized on the plane!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think they gave you a small piece of the puzzle by what "Dave" told Hurley. What Dave said was partially true about it being in Hurleys head. I believe that "most" of the survivors are in mental institutions. Possibly several or the same, but with the virtual reality theory it doesn't much matter. We already know that the girl that likes him was. I think the darhma guys are the doctors. They are trying to control and stimulate patients in a psych ward for the purpose of making them better. It's like group therapy without the walls of the hospital. They medicate these patients with a mind controlling drug to make the feel like they are on a trapped island together. The medication is experimental. It's sort of like the Matrix.</p><p>Now I said "most" are in an institiion, because some of the survivors are not real. They are put there to test the patients or to help with their recovery. The one women needed her husband to come to help her recovery so he was a survivor from the tail end of the plane. I believe he's not really a patient, just like Dave and Jacks father, and Walt (I'll get to that).</p><p>The island is a closed area that they can't leave.. the hospital. The others are doctors who appear sinister, but have their best interest in mind, as most mental patients will tell you of their doctors.</p><p>They tried before the crash with the French womens group and the meds didn't work. She was the only survivor. Hurley was the next test subject and was given a positive alternate reality where he won the lottery. He was tested when terrible things were happening around him to people he cared about. This was to help him deal with the porch collapsing. While he was in this other Lost survivors were checking into mental institutions as well. They were linked together and as they get better they will die off. I believe Boons sister stopped being selfish and learned her lesson, so she was gone.</p><p>Each person must face there fears and what put them there. Jack saw his father, the musician found drugs, Sieed? had to face his torture and make a decision, Walt got taken leaving the father to have to deal with abandonment issues, hurley has to deal with food addiction, echo had to deal with the drug plane, the australian girl had to deal with the loss of her child, etc. etc. Certain things had put them in the mental institution and the are LOST. The pregnant girl went to LA gave up her child and freaked. Jack went to his fathers funeral and freaked, etc. etc.</p><p>The back story of each "real" survivor will lead to one place and that is a mental institution. The doctors had to give them each a setup to get them on the plane and on the island. However none of it is real.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe the button is the time they have to take their medication to stay in this reality. Every 108 minutes or something. The numbers are also something from the hospital, like the drugs serial number or a phone number 1 (4 8 1)5 16 -23 42 or 1(481)516-2342.</p><p>Just a theory but I think I got it. What do you think?</p><p>I'll elaborate on the real person (patient) and not real person.</p><p>Jack - patient - dealing with his father's loss (father not real) (runner guy in hatch before them not real, there to remind Jack about his wifes recovery)</p><p>Boon Sister (sorry forgot her name) - patient - dealing with issues from scamming family and selfishness (Boon not real after she was recovered he was not needed so he died.)</p><p>Michael - patient - dealing with abanding his son (Walt not real needed to be there and then taken away to test him)</p><p>Sun - patient - ran away to US from husband and freaked (Husband not real he goes on the raft and she thinks he's dead to help recovery)</p><p>Mostly everyone with a back story is a real patient, anyone without one is mostly planted there to test, help, or guide the survivors.</p></div>
