		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to chime in with Tony (although I'll put my thoughts a bit more mildly). I think that when the name and time are at the top of a post, separated from the posting by a line, it's hard to read and associate the poster with the posting. I often make the mistake of thinking the name belongs to the posting above.  Even though you have two lines separating the posts, I get fooled into thinking that the dashed line is the separator, not the blank lines. There's my two cents.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think they need to be grouped together better and a simple line does not group things well in my opinion.</p><p>I like the bg color idea.  What about putting a border around each comment.  Similar to how the pods are done on the right side.  I also think it makes total sense to put the poster name first then the comments.  Since we are working with analogies.</p><p>The horse pulls the cart.<br>The poster posts the comments.</p><p>Thus, the poster goes ahead of the comments :).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The simple solution that I'd suggest is just to switch the places of the dashed line with the poster's name/time.  I don't care whether the name comes before or after the post, I just want to be able to tell at a glance which name belongs with which post.</p></div>
