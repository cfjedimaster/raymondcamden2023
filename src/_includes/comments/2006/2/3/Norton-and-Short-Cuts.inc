		<div class="comment_text"><p>Pfft, don't even get me started on Norton.  For the past month and a half, I've had to download the virus definitions manually and install them.  Why?  Because LiveUpdate throws an LU1844 error when it tries to install the updates - seems like this is a known issue with LU.  And yes, I have the latest LU.</p><p>What's even stranger is that it works on my desktop, just not on my laptop.  Same version on both too.</p><p>Once my subscription runs out with Norton I'm going to be looking for a new AV, plus it's acting more like bloatware.</p><p>I'd like to hear some opinions on other AV programs.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I gave up on Norton a little over a year ago and went to the free Grisoft AVG anti-virus. I've been much happier with it and have been virus free (I also use the MS Spynet beta to prevent worms and spyware).  It seems much less invasive than Norton was (and uses a lot less system resources).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's things like this that lead me to believe that norton is a virus in it's own right. Uninstalls don't work half the time.... viruses are not removed..... Move a shortcut it throws an error.... It doesnt return the car on time..... I think EVIL sums this program up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I stopped using Norton a few years ago.  I'm currently running Avast! Home Edition and think it is a much better product.  It's free and has built in E-mail, IM, Web and File System real-time scans and plays nice with everything else on my system.  You do have to register with them, but all you need is an e-mail address.</p></div>

On one I get nothing but "Win32 is accessing the xxxx" pop ups while the other chooses random times to change when my subscription status, (reboots reset the subscription back to normal).</p><p>As for the short cuts issue - it has obviously caught a load of users as they even have a support document on how to 'resolve' it.</p><p>I'm with the AVG users, plus now they have a fairly good firewall product I'm going to use them. Norton is just too much hard work!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've never had this issue with Norton as I use NOD32 (a great virus program), but I have had a similar issue with my Cisco VPN Client. I moved the shortcut in my start menu and the next time i tried to run it, it started to reinstall itself and made me restart my machine before it would work. Then I had 2 shortcuts and when I deleted the one I had moved, it broke again and I had to reinstall it AGAIN! I thought this was the only program that cared about shortcuts but I guess not.

Grisfot AVG for AV, Acronis TrueImage for backups (as opposed to Ghost), and I'm a happy camper.  I will never, ever, ever install another piece of Norton software on any machines I own.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Couldn't agree more on the Norton front.  It's killing a PC at home.  One day the Internet Suite's firewall just decided to start blocking all traffic from Outlook. I've yet to track down how to fix it. We recently made a whole sale switch to Trend Micro for all workstations in our office. After 4 weeks it is 100x better.</p><p>Also, I used to use ZoneAlarm for a PC firewall and had a lot of success with the free and licensed versions.  It is not as user friendly as Trend Micro but I found it far more configurable. You just have to spend some time reading up on it.</p></div>
