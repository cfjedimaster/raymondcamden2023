		<div class="comment_text"><p>There's actually a way to fix that score cut off issue if you contact arcade1up they can send out a replacement pcb that fixes 3 issues one being sometimes galaga and galaxian will freeze up causing the game to be entirely unplayable unless turned on and off again the next being the tip of the ship in galaxian is the wrong color it should be red not white and then obviously it fixes the issue with galaga not properly displaying high scores i had contacted arcade1up about it and they had sent me a different pcb that was easy to install and fixed everything I now have a high score of about 240,000</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's actually not hard at all to install lol I am not all that tech smart with these things either but it was super easy all you do is take the backdoor off the game and on the back of the monitor theres a little metal plate being held on with 2 screws unscrew it and the pcb is in there then you just detatch the cables one by one unscrew the black ground wire take the new pcb put it in replace all the wires in the same way you took them off put the monitor cover back on and the back door back on fire the game up and presto! it should be fixed then but I can understand for some people even simple things cab be confusing even for me sometimes</p></div>
