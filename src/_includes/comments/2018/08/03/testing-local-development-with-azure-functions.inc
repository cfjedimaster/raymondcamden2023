		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond, I found your article by accident through a Google recommendation. It's great you're sharing your experiences of beginning your journey with Azure Functions - it'll be useful to countless others. A lot of this becomes easier with the VS Code IDE and the plugins Microsoft provides to support Azure devs. But whether or not you're using those tools you'll eventually get to a point where large deployments don't go quite right (with NodeJs) or take a long time. Before then, start using the app setting WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE (lots of docs out there) and you'll have a much better experience.</p></div>
