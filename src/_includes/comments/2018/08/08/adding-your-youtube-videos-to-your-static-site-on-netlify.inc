		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Raymond!</p><p>This is a nice example of a pattern I fnd myself leaning on quite often:</p><p>1. Request content from content feeds around the web<br>2. Stash content in a format friendly to your chosen SSG<br>3. Generate your site to include your gathered content via your templates</p><p>Having the ability to run a build script in Netlify, just as you would locally, opens this up nicely.</p><p>The example of mine that you referenced ultimately got replaced by Netlify's built-in form handling and API access to the submissions.</p><p>I updated it a little and added some notifications, and it turned into this example: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcss-tricks.com%2Fjamstack-comments%2F%3AWvQGlnGFqPSri4ueXWQbOzUYKes&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://css-tricks.com/jamstack-comments/">https://css-tricks.com/jams...</a></p><p>But it all just uses the same pattern that you demonstrate so nicely here.</p></div>
