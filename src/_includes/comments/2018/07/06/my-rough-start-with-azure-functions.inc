		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice - agree that Lambda makes a function that lives on a HTTPS URL more complex than perhaps it should be, I've been using Google Cloud for a while now and HTTPS functions are easy to implement although it annoys me that there's no "make CORS work" button or deployment setting, so I've had to handle CORS myself in Google Cloud using the CORS package from npm.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not to necessarily stand up for Microsoft and the login process, but it sounds like the real culprit is Brave here. Add to it that Brave has some built-in ad blocking and I'd almost expect issues.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that's fair - but at the same time - testing to see how ad blockers impact your site should be something folks do in general I think. As a user, I don't expect an ad blocker to impact a dev type portal. It would still be my fault of course. But this is one of those things (imo) where even though it's an issue on my side, the people running the site may still want to try to prevent it anyway. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think too that if I worked on Brave - I'd hit some big portals like this and see what happens. They should also be doing work to ensure important sites like this work well.</p></div>
