		<div class="comment_text"><p>I realize this is Enterprise level stuff -- but it really peeves me when something like this doesn't have a "free" or "hobbyist" pricing tier.</p><p>What places like this don't realize is that most developers are happy to try something out on their own -- and then take it to the paper-pushers when they think it's awesome and something worth spending $$$ on.</p><p>Contentful (for example) is a great example of this thinking. The hobbyist tier is free and generous, and I've started to build side projects with Contentful now (connecting to Gatsby, for example) that have made me realize -- yeah, this is a useful, fantatistic thing. As a result, I'm pushing this as a production level thing that we should budget for.</p><p>Raygun seems cool -- and I've love to try it -- but there's no way to do this (at least none that I can tell from their bottom of the page pricing list). Frustrating -- and (IMHO) a bit backwards these days.</p><p>Great article, though. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd check the tier just for crash reporting. As I said, it is 19 bucks a month which is absolutely within the hobbyist level imo.</p></div>
