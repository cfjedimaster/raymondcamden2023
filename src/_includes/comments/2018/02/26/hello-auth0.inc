		<div class="comment_text"><p>Grats on the new gig! Hadn't heard of Auth0, looks pretty interesting. I cringe when a client starts talking about implementing SSO "yeah would love to work on that but have that thing to do for the rest of the uh, epoch, yeah."<br>Looking forward to your posts about the goodies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congrats on the new job, Ray. I look forward to hearing about the technologies your new employer has available. And maybe even how it can be integrated with CF. ;-) My apps usually hold sensitive data so I'm against allowing logins using social media IDs because we can't enforce how strong a password the user has set, and it's more likely to be a target of hacking than our own less-known service. But I still want to learn about Auth0. I mean, you wouldn't go and work for anyone unless they had super interesting products, right? :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So while I'm not going to be working in the Identity area, do know that Auth0 supports non-social logins as well as social. You can use your own datastore, or have us host it. You can also setup password rules and the such. What I like about the Identity product is that supports the "quick and simple" auth scenarios as well as the more complex ones. I like a platform that handles both ends of the spectrum. ;)</p><p>As for Extend, yes, you absolutely could use it within the context of a ColdFusion application. Once my intro article goes live (most likely on the Auth0 blog, but I'll leave a note on my blog to alert readers of it), you'll see an example of integration with Node, but the same principal would apply to any platform.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well to your first question - is the extension ready for production - I'd say yes. I haven't used this, but I know if we document it it's meant to be used versus something that may be an experiment.</p><p>If you are asking about it's use in Vue and examples, the best I could suggest is Googling for it. In theory it shouldn't matter what front end library you use. While the Identity aspect of Auth0 isn't my main task in this new job, I *do* want to try it with Vue myself just to see it in action.</p><p>Lastly - if you need specific help on it, you may want to try to the forums here: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.auth0.com%2F%3AT9AA-SNfGitZJu2EIIQ6PBgS1ZA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://community.auth0.com/">https://community.auth0.com/</a>. Not saying you can't ask me (grin), but you may get more experienced responses there. :)</p></div>
