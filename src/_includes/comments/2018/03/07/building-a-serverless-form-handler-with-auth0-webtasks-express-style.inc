		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Camden,<br>I really liked your worked out example. I am  still learning and trying to reproduce the same scheme except that I have to style the form using CSS. How would you generate the webtask, if you had a style.css file that was referenced by FORM_HTML and THANKS_HTML? <br>Thanks in anticipation.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To keep things simple, I'd just inline it in the HTML. Ie:</p><p>&lt;style&gt;<br>stuff here<br>&lt;/style&gt;</p></div>
