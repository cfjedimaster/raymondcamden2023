		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is really cool...i have already sent it out to my CFML teammates and other JS developers at my company...i want to learn nativescript, but think learning vue will help with that and with my cfml work...I know you have a job that allows you to learn and teach, but you have 6 kids, how do you find time to do all you do? It would be cool to see you write up a blog about how you balance life, kids and the pursuit of happiness...then get people to comment on it to see how others balance work/life and learning...i have a balance with work and kids, but learning, and recharing/seeing my wife, not a great balance...Good Luck with this training class...always enjoy the way you teach so i am sure this will be a great training :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Seven kids actually. ;)</p><p>I'm lucky that my job enables/empowers me to do research on things so I can do a lot if in my 9 to 5. I'll also do a bit of work at night, *after* the kids are in bed (well the young ones) while watching TV since most TV shows don't require a lot of attention.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Vuejs has quite an ecosystem. I am glad these topics are getting covered. Some of it reminds me of ColdFusion. I am currently enamored with Bootstrap Vue. See <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbootstrap-vue.js.org%2F%3Air5TY2ZKi0RZ8EokcsW-6itv9Wk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/">https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/</a></p></div>
