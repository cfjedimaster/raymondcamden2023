		<div class="comment_text"><p>Honestly I've lost faith in CFDJ. I've been a subscriber since issue 1, but lately they've been falling further and further behind. I see that JDJ comes out every month in the first few days, but CFDJ has been coming later and later...last month I actually got the September edition in the first week of October. The October digital edition isn't even up yet and it's the 19th, and the digital edition usually preceeds the print version by several weeks.</p><p>Further, they just randomly changed the digital edition archives password and no one ever emailed or informed me what the new one is. Repeated emails to Sys-Con have gotten no reply. I think I'm just going to let my subscription expire and move on.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you have problems that don't get resolved by attempting to contact sys-con then contact me directly and I'll get to the bottom of it.  At the moment we've actually got a lot of material in the works, so it's not as urgent as the blog makes it seem.  That said, we're always ready for submissions and to talk with people so if you're interested at all, let us know. I can't comment on what month name is printed on what magazine when you get it - that's a press issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought about subscribing to them once and then I saw that it cost $250 at the time for a year subscription. Now it's $90 a year and that's still too much money. Sorry man but at $7.50 an issue, I could get a copy of Jugs at that price :).</p><p>Not only that, but the articles are nothing new or exciting. Every piece of information in the magazine, you can find easier on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%3AwPKEY58eRSFDjxCrnA1CA1K0Ky0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="groups.google.com">groups.google.com</a>. I've gone to Looksmart and you can download some of the last editions for free. After checking them out, I came to the conclusion that I still wouldn't buy into it.</p><p>Personally they need to redo the entire magazine and rethink the marketing strategy. They should give the magazine away for free and count on advertisers to flip the bill like most magazines do. Either that, or lower the price to something that isn't ridiculous.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, but "Jugs" doesn't have a picture of me in it every month ;)<br>Seriously, though...<br>The magazine has had the same subscription cost for at least the past 3 years or so - I don't know how long ago you looked into subscribing?<br>I don't agree that the articles aren't new or exciting.  As an example off the top of my head, I've written an article running in the next issue that I guarantee you isn't anywhere else in any format.  Actually, I'd say most of the articles fit into that category.  They tend to be more focussed on niche solutions and specific topics than the typical article you'd find somewhere online.<br>I can't speak for their marketting or pricing, but regarding "redoing" the magazine - I'm putting some practices into place to do just that.<br>If you have some constructive criticism regarding content or format; I'm all ears.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Simon, I appreciate your response. The problem I have isn't at all with the articles themselves, of which I usually find at least a few that are worth the price of the mag in each issue.  It's the general lack of response from Sys-Con when there are problems, and the general slacking that I perceive in the distribution of the mag...the impression I get is that they don't really care, and that they think that JDJ and the other mags are more important (and maybe to Sys-Con they are).  Can you comment on when and why they changed the archive access passwords, and why they didn't notify anyone or tell anyone what the new password(s) are? I've just let my subscription lapse but maybe I'll re-up again.  I've always felt it's sort of my duty to support the mag that is dedicated to my career choice.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not qualified to comment on the order of importance they do or don't place on their titles - they practically give away JDJ - I don't know the reasoning, though.<br>I am not sure why they changed the password - but I'll ask them to send it to you ASAP if you send me your email address.</p></div>
