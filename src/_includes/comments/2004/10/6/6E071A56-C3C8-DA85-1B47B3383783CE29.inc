		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't get this survey, but I did get a signed picture of George and Laura right after I registered as a Democrat in Texas, which I thought was a bit bizarre.  I think as much shady stuff goes on in Texas as in Florida--when I registered to vote four years ago, everything looked good until I went to vote, then they said they had "lost" my voter registration information and didn't let me vote.  Not like a vote for anyone but Bush will matter in Texas, but it's the principle of it all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I must not have been very clear. Both parties ask for donations. The point is that -this- donation request was written in a very underhanded way. The reader is led to believe that they -must- return the donation. In fact, they are not told it is a donation, but a processing fee. Again, most folks won't fall for this, but some will.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I'm a Bush supporter, and I think the survey is slimy, no doubt. Eveyone reading this blog has more than enough intelligence to toss that thing in the trash. You're dead right: there are significant numbers of people who would be duped into sending $11.00 to them. It's just devious and misleading, any way you cut it.</p><p>This does happen on both sides, though. This fact doesn't invalidate your concern, but it does.</p><p>My cousin who attends the Univeristy of Miami was treated to food and kegs at several parties by DNC operatives who traded the food and booze for the ability to register them as Democrats and their promise to vote for Kerry.</p><p>This gets very little coverage, media wise, but seems to be pretty wide spread. I think it's equally as abhorant to persuade  young, naive, 1st time voters to cast a vote not on policy and positions, but on a cheap bribe.</p><p>What we need to make Carmen Electra President and all will be well!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is really amazing. That they would send a letter like that, trying to pretend that the RNC is now some official arm of the government. I agree with Roger, this is unacceptable. And if the DNC is doing this sort of thing, too -- sending letters such as this, I hope that others would make a comment about them, also.</p><p>As for paying the $11.00, may I add to the suggestion on how to send this in? I picked this up from a tale of taxes paid to the IRS, before it became illegal to do such things.</p><p>Pay the $11.00 in pennies, yes. But put them in a big jar and fill it with honey before you send it in.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>wow - the thought of politics, even when your not talking politics in your post - sure does set off a firestorm of comments from folks.</p><p>Craig - calm down - you really don't need to be insulting - it just makes you look bad.</p><p>Its funny, when I read this post I didn't think it was an attack on either party - just a "Hey, Look at this organization that is trying to scam people."</p><p>The sad thing here is that people obviously affiliated with both parties have lamented how the other party uses dirty, under-handed tricks.  It strikes me that this is just another example of how our two-party system has fallen to almost a single party system.  You can't even distiguish them by their types of corruption anymore.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i've never recieved anything like that. but i never recieve any mail at all from the dnc or rnc. now, had I recieved something like this from either party, it would have ended up in the trash without a second thought, and the whole event would have been most likely erased from my memory 2 seconds after it hit the trash bin. it would not have affected my thought process any more then the grocery store coupons in the mail that get thrown away as well.</p><p>i consider the iraq war a serious issue, i consider taxation a serious issue. i consider hundreds of things a serious issue, but not a deceptive donation request recieved in the mail. that's why i'm surprised to see people blog about that. in my opinion, it's along the same level of blogging to the world that I went to the store and bought some milk.</p><p>but that's where I fail everytime. i consider myself a normal person (whether that's the case or not), and therefore blindly assume everyone else is like me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tony, when you post to a blog post, it is like auto-subscribing to a thread. Unfortunately, this is the default behaviour of the blog. If you want, I can remove your entries, and you will no longer get any posts. Or, you can just wait, as this thread can't stay active for too much longer. (Next week I'll blog on abortion and/or copyright and see how many posts -that- one gets. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is unnacceptable for a national political committee such as the NRSC to use deceptive/fraudulent techniques to trick people into sending in money. I don't see why Raymond's post generated protest from some of the readers here. Are you so blinded by your partisanship that you are unwilling to defend the basic integrity/legitimacy of political engagment? How is it okay, or politics-as-usual for an official national committee to trick people into donating through intentional misleading??</p><p>I've heard of other similar techniques used by the RNC, but this survey is much worse. Raymond-- if you are considering doing anything further with this, I'd like to help you out. <br>Please contact me (are you able to get my e-mail address from my post??)</p><p>-Jo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>And we got one of these in the mail today addressed to my wife. How they ever determined her to be a "registered republican" (which she isn't) is beyond me.</p><p>This year's version bears the name of "Senator Elizabeth Dole" on the letterhead.  It also has what APPEARS to be a red ink pad stamp that says "Registration #" with the numbers "54.93.252" in black ink inside of the phony rubber stamp marking.  This was obviously printed to appear hand stamped even though it was not.  The whole deal smacks of the crap that appears in the typical Readers Digest Sweepstakes mailings...maybe this is where the mailing list originated.  I have serious doubts that it comes from any official Reppublican Party agency, however we have a Republican headquarters right here in town and I think I shall pay them a visit tomorrow.</p><p>My wife handed me the mail with this in it and told me not to lose it because she "had to" fill it out and mail it in.  Then she said that it would cost us money to respond to it and that we even had to pay the $11.00 if it wasn't filled out.</p><p>IMHO the statements made in the mailing are illegal.  If they aren't they certainly should be, especially if they did not actually originate from Lizzy Dole and/or the Republican Party.</p><p>I'm thinking mail fraud here.</p><p>I googled up this site and was very surprised to see that the exact same mailing was used in 2004....although I probably shouldn't be.  The fact that it is being used again this election season leads me to believe that it was very effective last time around.</p><p>Another thing I find interesting is the 7 day turn around being demanded in this "time sensitive" material in light of the date on the last post which was in March, a full 3 months prior to the one we got.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just got the survey this week and took the time to fill it out last night with the help of four of my friends.  It proved to be quite entertaining, and I'm fairly certain I will be removed from their list once they receive it in the mail.  Considering I disagree with both major political parties due to issues on the sanctity of life, the majority of my answers quoted the bible and proclaimed my love for Jesus.  Why not write in every answer when there is only a yes or no box was our philosophy!</p><p>Despite our laughter about the survey and the witty answers we came up with, it is really frustrating the slimy scam they are running here.</p></div>
