		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, this is one of the reasons why BlogMan includes a subscription system. Check out BlogMan from the DRK or online at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mossyblog.com%2F%3AuImsafHwtb_UOCohrqZzYHAmRLE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mossyblog.com/">http://www.mossyblog.com/</a> for an example. Basically if a user subscribes to the comment they will recieve an email when someone posts along with a link to unsubscribe.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Sorry I was so short with you yesterday. It was uncalled for. Like you, I  not only had a weekend from Hell, I didn't get any sleep either (6 hours in 48 hours). On top of that I had to get a project out last night and it was just one more thing to cause me stress.</p><p>I really appreciate you looking into adding this feature into your next version.</p><p>Again, please accept my apologies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bryan: Yep... and when I reviewed Blogman I think I remember thinking that I needed to... um... "borrow" that feature. ;)</p><p>Tony: No worries at all. It took a thread like that to get me off my butt and get working on the feature anyway. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray: The auto-subscribe also made you famous outside the world of CF... Shelley (Burningbird) Powers posted a very unhappy entry about it in her blog.</p><p>And while you're on the subject, let me do my standard bit of evangelism and encourage you to add support for wfw:commentRss. It puts comments where people actually want them: inside their aggregators.</p></div>
