		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm loving my iPod.  I've got a 40GB 4th gen, with a pretty sweet black iSkin (highly recommend a decent case).  I use mine mainly when I hike or work out at the gym (which is almost every day).  It does remarkably well with the rough terrain I hike, although sometimes it freezes after the 25 min buffer runs out when I'm bouncing around pretty hard.</p><p>Rumor has it that a new 60GB model with color screen is right around the corner...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Careful with the iTrip.  I had to have mine replaced 3 times (though they have alwasy been happy to send replacements). For some reason it would just quit working.  I ended up getting the Belkin which has been flawless and you don't have to lead any special software.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sure.  With ITunes open and your IPod connected, you have to change the settings.  I can't remember off the top of my head cause mind is keyed up to my MAC.  You should be able to right click over the IPod icon and change the settings.  You will see something to the effect of "Allow Disk Browsing".  I will have to look tonight, when I get home.  But you can also you it for disk storage if you want.  If you play around with it, you'll find it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>On windows, XPlay is by _far_ a better program for using your ipod than iTunes.   Check it out at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafour.com%3AGM4M4CnKhcjjQ7N8suw8IucMOeU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.mediafour.com">www.mediafour.com</a> - they even have a demo version.</p></div>
