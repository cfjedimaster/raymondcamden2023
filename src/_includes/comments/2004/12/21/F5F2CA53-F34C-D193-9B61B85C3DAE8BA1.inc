		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>RDS is a bit of a sticking point for us because it's a closed spec and Macromedia quite understandably doesn't want to release the details of how to interact with the RDS servlet.</p><p>We have plans to get around this by creating an Open Source alternative to the RDS Servlet that comes bundled with CFMX. That would mean you could use our "flavour" of RDS with any CFMX server, but not with CF 5. We'll probably also add support for BlueDragon. Specifics of what functionality we'll be exposing haven't been decided, but initially it will probably just be file system operations rather than CF server management.</p><p>The "Save As" issue is one that I only really became aware of in the last couple of weeks and I hope to have a fix for that in the next nightly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Erki,</p><p>The issue isn't with the difficulty of reverse engineering it. It's with the ethics and accountability. It would be very difficult to prove that we hadn't done anything illegal in the process and we don't want to get bogged down in some sort of IP spat with Macromedia.</p><p>In any case, it would probably be easier to write both a Servlet and client from scratch than to reverse engineer the MM protocol completely.</p><p>If MM wants to open it up in the future that would be great, but until then I think we want to make sure we stay on the right side of the line.</p></div>
