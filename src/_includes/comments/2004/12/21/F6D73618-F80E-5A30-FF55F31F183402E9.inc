		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond, I went to check the format, but he got Slashdot'd, and the mirror I checked was timing-out too. Is this video delivered in SWF? (If so, we might be able to help him out easily.) Or is it in some other video format that either plays in a predictable second window (QT, Real, WMP), or which plays in unpredictable fashion (MPG, some rarer use of others)?</p><p>tx,<br>jd</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks. I wonder if it was a question of not finding the SWF video templates with media controls, or if they were found and the creator decided not to use an approach like this...?<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmacromedia.com%2Fdevnet%2Fmx%2Fflash%2Fvideo_templates.html%3AHnwR_P6i0JXUVcjx1MTTy0WNXZc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/video_templates.html">http://macromedia.com/devne...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm assuming it was just an artistic decision. I could be wrong. Certainly I see it enough to bug the heck out of me, which is the reason for the post. Another example is the JibJab stuff that was famous a few months back. I think it comes down to user education (or developer education) and considering the user experience when you develop something.</p></div>
