		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray:</p><p>I also had as one of my primary goals with Tracking Tools (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftracking-tools.com%3AyuyhKHqPmQiwhaJt3evmQsjSiI4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="tracking-tools.com">tracking-tools.com</a>) to make it easy to deploy.  I was able to achieve a 0 step deploy (just download the package and doubleclick) while also supporting major db platforms.  The point of this comment is not to plug my app ;) but to let you know it is doable and to look forward to some articles in future CFDJs that describe how.</p><p>-Phil</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, some better documentation on how to set it up for multiple projects would be nice. I really like it but could not seem to get away from the "default"  project it monitors. Apart from that it is really excellent!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm using it on a small project for one website. An enterprise level one that could easily incorporate multiple projects would be great. Though current version is very nice, keep it up!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tested it also... very inspiring. Yet, with SOS coming out I am evaluating everything I look at as to how easily it can be deployed into a shared application environment. Would love to integrate a "SOS" version of lighthouse... if you are game to it. I don't want to cross over anyones rights though. (And just perhaps my goals would be more along the big boy version of the software.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No... share open source. It's a framework for Coldfusion development that allows multiple methodologies, customization... SOS will be free, but the applications that I personally write for it won't always be. Like Fusebox is free. It just does a whole lot more. (Web Skins, presentation handlers, shared application platform, UDF Libraries, Enhanced API platform... and more, more, more.)</p></div>
