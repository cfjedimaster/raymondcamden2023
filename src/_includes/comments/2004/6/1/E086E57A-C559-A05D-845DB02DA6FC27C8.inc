		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finished the game about a week ago and was playing it more neutral (picking evil choices then going back to good). My attributes didn't advance very far doing that so I had to cheat a few times to get out of some ruff spots. I thought Bioware did an awesome job too. Why they aren't doing the squeal is beyond me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Does the game get better after the first level? I started playing it while doing other stuff and couldn't get it to hold my attention. It's the first time I've played a game with that style of play too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was pretty hooked from the beginning, but you defintely have to like it's style. I really, really can't recommend it enough, BlogFusion. I'd maybe give it two more hours of your life before you give up on it. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Alright, based on your recommendation, I'll give it another whack.</p><p>Man, there are simply TOO many great games out there right now, and my computer is getting too slow!

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just picked up Far Cry (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarcry.ubi.com%2F%29%3AfbUwj-9m9jCDSVm0NCcHGBwLSXs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://farcry.ubi.com/)">http://farcry.ubi.com/)</a> a couple of weeks ago. What an amazing game. The AI is really incredible. You can download a demo from UBI's website. The game actually is one of the first FPS I've seen which actually has an impressive single player game play. The enemies will really work as a team, and it's neat to watch them spread out over an area trying to locate you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan, I just started playing Far Cry a few days ago, and I agree, the AI is _very_ sweet. Plus, it's fun to play a shooter that is (somewhat) realistic (i.e., no plasma guns, etc.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The physics are really amazing too. If you haven't done so already, just spend some time pushing barrels into the water or exploding things up. I've been most impressed by the physics of their water--plus it's just way cool swimming under water and seeing the underwater life.</p><p>Just wait until you get to the trigens, there's a few of them that are tough little buggers.</p></div>
