		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmmm - I've been using firefox pretty much fulltime for 6+ months and have never seen any problems like this.<br>I can def. view source on a submitted form without it trying to resubmit - have you tried Ctrl-U?<br>Dunno - maybe it's one of the extensions I installed early on but it's not something I've come across...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This actually has to do w/the fact that Firefox goes and does a new GET/POST to display the source code (which is pretty lame.) I haven't played around w/it, but I wonder if changing your cache settings would affect the view source code. It's definitely a waste of bandwidth that Firefox hits a site twice to view the source code.</p><p>Another idea to workaround this, might be to hit [CTRL][A] to highlight all the content on a page and then right-click on the page and select "View Selected Source Code". I believe this comes from the browser's cache.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you have every right to complain about the bug, whether or not you plan to fix it. You are helping the Firefox community by simply exposing the bug and making Firefox that much better.</p><p>If it makes you feel better. Version 0.9 fixed a buggy/twitchy behavior that bothered me since version 0.6. The buggy behavior was that Firefox would not sustain hovering over a link when the browser window occupied my second monitor. A rather obscure yet annoying behavior, I'm pleasantly surprised to see it fixed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To the Edited portion of your rant:  How does a browser "reload" a page that is the target of an HTTP post operation _without_ reposting?  To reload (except from cache) the browser has to go and request the page again from the server.  To do so without posting data is going to break many pages that are the target of an HTTP post.  The rest are going to display different results than if you posted some specific set of data.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have downloaded and installed 0.9 but I haven't tested if they fixed a standards-breaking bug that I have been complaining about (and I haven't watched the bugtracker for that).</p><p>Try using FireFox in the strictest mode with an xhtml page using a custom dtd -- IE downloads and checks the markup against the dtd, Firefox doesn't (at least not 0.7)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have come accross this problem too. I have also noticed a few other weird things as well...</p><p>Sometimes I get a blank screen when I view source, even though I have a loaded page and other times I get the previous loaded page's source. It doesn't really make sense to me. The post above stating that firefox fetches the source from the server does enlighten me a bit though.</p><p>I am running windoze pro 64 on an amd64 so thought that might not be helping. Not sure really.</p></div>
