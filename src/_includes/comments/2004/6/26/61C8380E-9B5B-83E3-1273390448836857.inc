		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond, I have downloaded it again, and I still dont see the powerpoint.. I do a find on the zip for .ppt and it doesnt find anything either. What is the directory that the power point file is in? Are you using winXP built in zip to view the zip file? because this is what I am using.</p><p>Cheers</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, there were technical difficulties in many of the sessions, but mostly not show stoppers at least.  The common themes seemed to be wireless access, microphone problems, and projectors, in that order.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No apologies necessary. Though it seems too many sessions ran out of time. The sessions may need to run longer next year and I suggested holding off on questions until the end of the presentation.  It wasn't unusual for an audience member to raise an issue that only 2% of the audience would care about or encounter.</p><p>Matt Liotta was good about keeping on target and pretty much shot down all questions until the end of his presentation. And guess what? He was one of the handful of presenters that made it through all their material.</p></div>
