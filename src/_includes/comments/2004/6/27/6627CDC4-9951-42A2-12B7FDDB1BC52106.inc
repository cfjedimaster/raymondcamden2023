		<div class="comment_text"><p>You're not the only one I've heard complaining about the Ramada.  I bet you paid a lot more for a lot less than I did.</p><p>I used Priceline and stayed at the Gaithersburg Hilton.  We had the luxury of driving up so we had a car... 5 minutes to the metro stop, and 2 stops away from the Doubletree.  It worked out really well.</p><p>I hear the New Atlanta guys also used Priceline to stay downtown DC, and metro'ed out to the Doubletree.</p><p>At any rate, I agree, the conference does need to be expanded.</p><p>I was in on your presentation, btw, no apologies necessary.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I too stayed at the Ramada.  It was convenient and parking was free, but otherwise the service was horrible.  I did demand (and receive) an additional 20% discount for the poor service and aggravation.  It never hurts to ask!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>You have nothing to apologize for about your presentation.  Problems may have cut your presentation short but it still was one of the best that I heard.</p><p>I do agree with you about the Ramada.  I have stayed in plenty of hotels at a third of the price per night I paid for the Ramada that were far better.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Priceline is naming its own price now!!  I was bidding and it only has one button in bottom middle of screen.  You have to keep pressing it and rebidding.  This is called a trainer.  It becomes intuitive for the user to press the only button the is used for navigation.  I was bidding $500 on a ticket and the named a price of $1058.47  I navigated to the next screen using the only button in the bottom middle.  Without any confrimation.  Congratulations!!  You just bought the most expensive NONREFUNDABLE ticket!!</p><p>Pricelines stock is dropping.  They are losing repeat business.  They have lost me, my wife, and 4 other persons at her Insurance business when we conference called the customer service the was harder than heck to get a hold of.  The lady fought so hard to tell me her practice was LEGAL.  She fought for a $100 dollar mark-up.  Me and my wife and her coworkers fly so often Priceline could have made 20X that off us by keeping us as a customer and not LEGALLY DECEIVE us.  Great job Priceline.  You lost a lot of business that will never come back.  Plus hundreds of people call for insurance and quotes and it is a topic that will come up.  The word is spreading.  Sell Priceline Stock.  Don't use the website it is deceptive and will rob you.  It will authorize charges on the card you use for Reward and Crap that you don't want to pay for.</p><p>Remember it is LEGAL.  They have your card.  You agreed to the fine print.  Call your card company and have them issue you a new card/number.   KillaWabbit</p></div>
