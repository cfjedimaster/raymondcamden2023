		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,</p><p>I'm curious - did you ever find out more info on the cause of these types of problems?  I'm having a similar issue when I call cfinclude inside a CFC that's a web service.  Relative mappings work okay, but virtual mappings (which I have to use for this particular file) are "lost" and it can't find the file.</p><p>It sounded similar to your dilemmas, I thought I'd check with you.</p><p>Thanks.<br>Nolan</p></div>
