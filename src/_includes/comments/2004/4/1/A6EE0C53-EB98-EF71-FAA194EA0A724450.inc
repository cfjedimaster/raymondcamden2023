		<div class="comment_text"><p>This problem, or similar, has occured with a large number of SmartSteps;  the Pentium just generates too much heat.  I believe there were attempts to bring a class-action lawsuit.  Over here in the UK, we have much better consumer laws, and I was eventually able to get my SmartPC 250N replaced with a very nice Inspiron 8600.  Dell in the US are not even letting people buy extended warranties on their SmartSteps, which is a complete disgrace.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i had a similar shut off problem. i'll tell the condensed version of my story.</p><p>2001-05-15, bought dell latitude c800, great laptop, loving it.</p><p>2003-01-15, one usb port loose, dell sends out (for free) tech to replace entire motherboard (integrated parts). that motherboard shuts down every 15 minutes or so under normal use, as you described.</p><p>2003-01-20, dell sends out another motherboard, free. same problem, only once every day instead of every 15 minutes. still unacceptable.</p><p>2003-01-25, dell offers to send another motherboard. i tell them i don't trust their refurbished motherboards, they offer an entire refurbushed c800. i tell them i don't trust refurbs. i stay calm, but i'm relentless.</p><p>2003-01-27, dell sends me a brand spaking new latitude c840 for free. this machine rocks!.</p><p>morals of story; spend the extra money on the deluxe warranty always be nice on the phone; dell is good.</p><p>my colleague recently purchased a dell precision laptop. 2GB ram, very fast. very good. i'll certainly stick with dell. and i'll search for coupons online when the time comes.</p></div>
