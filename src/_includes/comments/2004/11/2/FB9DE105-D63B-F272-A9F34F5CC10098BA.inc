		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love my Dell XPS (actually its a 9100, but its the same frame and guts, just missing things like dual channel ram).</p><p>I've never had a problem giving presentations using projectors.  Just remember that if the primary video can't decide whether to use the laptop, the external, or both. Just hit fn+F8 a couple times to have it do what you want (I haven't tested this with the DVI yet, although I haven't personally seen any DVI-supported projectors).</p></div>
