		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, that was my preso! Just happened to be surfing by and read the comments. Thanks for the kind words. I felt that the session should have been a little more advanced, but my track manager was worried that the audience might not have that much experience. Once I began polling the audience I realized that I could have safely added a lot more advanced stuff.</p><p>Maybe next year.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>James.</p></div>
