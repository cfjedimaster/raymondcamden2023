		<div class="comment_text"><p>Speaking of tools - and since you are th Cf man... do you know of any good image manipulation code that I can put on a coldfusion mx server?  I want to be able to automatically gebnerate thumbnails. This seems to be really needed in CFMX, and I can't wait for the rumored image processing tags in the next CF version.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>J, I would strongly recommend the new Alagad Imaging Component (AIC), from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Falagad.com%3AxudRW27dd25nxnSlLdr8UkiEXAQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="alagad.com">alagad.com</a>. The developer, Doug Hughes, has put a lot of effort into building a large (single) CFC that offers dozens of methods for manipulating (and even creating) images. It's all CFML, but leveraging the underlying Java APIs (abstracted away by the CFC, of course).</p><p>Cool solution, cool use of a CFC and java, cool guy. (It works on BlueDragon, too!) Check it out at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Falagad.com%3AxudRW27dd25nxnSlLdr8UkiEXAQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="alagad.com">alagad.com</a> (free trial available).</p><p>I should also add that BlueDragon has had a CFIMAGE tag for some time. You can learn more on that at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewatlanta.com%2Fbluedragon%2F%3AOJHb8SA5dvlK3Zd9cD6aOMnoLwY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="newatlanta.com/bluedragon/">newatlanta.com/bluedragon/</a>. Perhaps that sort of feature is what you're thinking may be added to CF in Blackstone. No mention of it, though, (nor much else about imaging) in the Blackstone tour report at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macromedia.com%2Fdevnet%2Fmx%2Fcoldfusion%2Farticles%2Fblackstone.html%3Ax-OhdVBKnhlThQt01ltm8Xy2CIs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/blackstone.html">http://www.macromedia.com/d...</a>.</p><p>In any case, for users of either CFMX or BD, the AIC tool will add tremendous imaging value at a low price.</p></div>
