		<div class="comment_text"><p>In case anyone is thinking about writing articles for CFML developers be advised that CFDJ doesn't reach as big of a market and doesn't compensate as well as other non-CFML specific publications. While the CFML community surely needs more writers, I think it would be best served if they wrote for a better publication.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree. I have written for other pubs that have not paid as much. For example, Macromedia pays nothing for Devnet content. I know you don't care for CFDJ as a publication as a whole, but I think it is a fine publication. It is hard to find a good middle ground for articles that can appeal to everyone, but I think in general CFDJ does an OK job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>viewed as a writer:</p><p>you mean CFDJ actually pays for content? hell's bells they asked *me* if i wanted to buy copies of my own articles when all i asked for was a few freebies to strategically scatter around our reception area. its also kind of hard to write i18n articles for a rag that uses the anti-unicode quark dtp (they actually marched into a <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Funicode.org%3AkZdV_vRh_6J9OJaLOXkP6u0kuDo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="unicode.org">unicode.org</a> meeting &amp; announced they would never support unicode). that was a pretty frustrating exercise.</p><p>viewed as a reader:</p><p>content is fairly good if a little too novice.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Something that may (or may not) be interesting is a CF implementation of a vector-space keyword matching engine I have been working on. I posted a quick summary on our company blog - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.headshift.com%2Farchives%2F000434.cfm%3AUPWNDuukNPII9PCfWJXvJFdGKfk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.headshift.com/archives/000434.cfm">http://www.headshift.com/ar...</a> - would this be suitable for a full article?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Peter, I have subscriobed through the website and get my CFDJ issues shipped overseas to Germany. Until today they have all arrived safe and well and so far I'm happy. Considering the much higher price for the international version I would expect them to be sent by air mail but it seems they come by ground mail so they are usually a couple of weeks late.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>why buy the mag when you can go to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flooksmart.com%3AHsN6n6rum2FOckweUbxo_ML5528&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="looksmart.com">looksmart.com</a> and read it for free. Most of the stuff in the mag is worthless anyways. I get better information from the CF, MSSQL newsgroups. Not only that, I don't have to pay $250 a year to read them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well obviously I disagree with you me (do you have a real name?). One thing you have to remember, and I know I said this before, but it is hard to please everybody with articles. Some articles will be too simple. Some will cover topics you'll never need (Oracle perhaps). But at the least it introduces you to things that - if they do come up - you'll be glad you had the resource.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What other CF-oriented magazines are on the market?  This one is the only one I can find at Barnes &amp; Nobles two blocks from where I work.  I'd love to see more articles than what CFDJ does publish but at this point I guess we're stuck with CFDJ.  It is okay, but it does seem, to me at least, heavily titled towards advertising more than articles that I can actually use.</p><p>Umm ... don't look at me - I don't know CF well enough to write a readable article without getting laughed at.  Well, I guess I could write something about my experiements with running Postgresql and CFMX 6.1 on my Mac, but my time is consumed by family and hobbies, so . . .</p></div>
