		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actualy love that he does that... I think it'll be very interesting to see how he ties all of them in together for the final book in the series. Have you started Song of Susanna yet? It has even more of the tying in of other books....you may hate it. :-(</p><p>Anyhoo... awesome series....</p><p>thanks for blogging on it</p><p>-Brian</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, great series.</p><p>I've been very lucky that I only discovered them last year so can pretty much read all 7 in a row. The guy who introduced me read the Gunslinger back in 197x!</p><p>I thought the appearance of Harry Potter references was getting a bit much, but lets hope we actually see a Stephen King character.</p><p>Song of Susanna is my first ipod Audio Book, should be interesting</p><p>nick</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i love the Dark tower Series...I'd have to say though that DTV, as good as it was wasn't one of my favorites.  Too much non-action for me.  DT6 though, that is some good stuff.  I'm still waiting for the Black House - Dark Tower tie in to appear in the DT books, I would love to see jack sawyer show up in DT7.</p><p>Side note:  they are making the Talsiman into a movie:  <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0384580%2F%3AxvVHkKhR-PGUnuoklHnAQzjOIH0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0384580/">http://imdb.com/title/tt038...</a> .  If they do it right, it should be really awesome, but there's been a lot of King books made into movies that really havent been all that great.</p></div>
