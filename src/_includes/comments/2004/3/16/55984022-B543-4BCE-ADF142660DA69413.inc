		<div class="comment_text"><p>So what's the point of the DRK?  The last one they put out had a bunch of software that is freely downloadable on the net.  Now they are not disclosing that we just have to wait 6 months to get it for free?  I am not complaining about your software - you did a great job - but I really wonder what's the point of Macromedia's DRK.  I for one am not purchasing a renewal and I know other developers who are hopping mad and this will only serve to reinforce their feeling that the DRK is a complete waste of time and money.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As far as I know this is NOT standard, it's just the deal I cut w/ Macromedia. I consider the DRKs to be well worth the $$ you need to purchase them. Obviously I'm a bit biased, but ignoring my app completely, I'd still buy them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here, here!  I think it's great both that Raymond thought to make such a deal and that Macromedia agreed to it -- everyone wins because those that pay for the DRK get 6 months of valuable use of this software, those that didn't can now finally start enjoying those benefits.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is not a standard agreement, but at the same time, as Nathan pointed out, we thought it was a win-win situation.  Giving Ray the opportunity to put Lighthouse on the DRK allowed him to devote a great deal of time to the project, and subjected the code to a more formal review and QA process than it would otherwise have gone through.  DRK subscribers had that code in their hands six months ago while non-subscribers are not getting the benefit.  Actually, I'd call it a win-win-win situation: Macromedia, Ray, and the CF community.</p><p>Christian</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The DRKs also serve the purpose of focusing and presenting the material. In case anyone hadn't noticed, a lot of this material would be hard to locate, might not even be developed, or would be cost prohibitive to acquire else where.</p><p>I like the DRK concept and would love to see it continue and grow.</p></div>
