		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is the wildest thing I've seen in some time. I actually have one of those records (Pete Shelley's 'XL-1'), so now I'm gonna have to go see if I can find this data track. I've never, ever heard of this before. Must have been all the rage in Britain, since the Sinclair was much more popular over there. Thanks for sharing.</p></div>
