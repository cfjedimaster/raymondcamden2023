		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunatley, it looks like this hot fix STILL doesn't fix all duplicate issues.  I'm running into a problem while porting a (badly) written CF 4.5 application where a structure of arrays that is being manipulated by reference then passed to a COM method is causing an error.  If I serialize then immediately deserialize the struct of arrays before passing it to the COM object, all is well.  Using duplicate, however, results in a COM automation error in CFMX.</p></div>
