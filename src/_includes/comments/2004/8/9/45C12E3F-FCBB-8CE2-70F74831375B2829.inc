		<div class="comment_text"><p>MTV/VH1 are getting the same here in the UK.  It is worrying that it is all becoming about prank shows and stupid stunts.  I want new music!  I suppose thats MTV2, but you dont need MTV2 if MTV was being MTV if you know what I mean. MTV UK is corny to the nth level.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I enjoyed the hell out of NWN and KOTOR.  I'm really surprised that NWN2 was announced when probably only a fraction of the current engine is being used in terms of stories / mods / etc.  They could have milked the NWN engine with expansion packs for all it's worth.  Graphically, there's nothing wrong with it IMHO.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree Tod. The engine for both those games are absolutely perfect. Graphically they could improve, but the engine itself just feels dead on. Probably the only thing I didn't like is the lack of random monsters. I'm so used to the classic RPG style of "Go out and kill for 2 hours to level up". However, this just made me more aware of how important it is to pick the right stuff when I level up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Only problem with the random NPC/Leveling is that they had to control the leveling to some degree.  If you got to level 18(? I think that's the highest) in the 1st game by the time you completed five or so mission and random NPC encounters, then... the game would be hard and by the time you got to the last level, you wouldn't care because you'd have insane amount of gold, you'd have the best of everything, etc.</p></div>
