		<div class="comment_text"><p>So has anyone reported any problems with the updater yet? I installed it on my test system and it went fine. However I did notice that the version was wrong. It still had the old version number. I found out the fix for this and blogged it at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frip747.blogspot.com%2F%3AyQvYtc5nHTBW-GmxR52L4rzmV_I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rip747.blogspot.com/">http://rip747.blogspot.com/</a>. I'm still going to wait a week or so before I put it into production.</p></div>
