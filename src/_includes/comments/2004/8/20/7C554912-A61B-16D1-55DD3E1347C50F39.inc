Very cool indeed, need to give it some time to build the iinitial index though and you should let it update tthe inindex in background.</p><p>Microsoft is realizing they're falling behind with  their search technologies.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No kidding! It's fast. I also set it to index the contents of the "My Documents" directory. With Lookout installed I don't even bother traversing through my neatly organized folders to find items I need. Lookout indexes everything in Outlook, including journal, notes, contacts, or whatever. I'm considering not even bothering with folders and subfolders in Outlook now that I have Lookout.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I installed it maybe a month ago. Awesome for finding things, but the frustrating aspect is you can't do much with the results. You can't move items (drag them), can't delete them, you can only open or reply/forward. Quite limiting in some ways, which is a shame, as probably easy enough to add, at least delete.</p></div>
