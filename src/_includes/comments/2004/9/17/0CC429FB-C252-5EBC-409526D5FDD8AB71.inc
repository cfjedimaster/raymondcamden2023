		<div class="comment_text"><p>Boyzoid - can you comment on the single player experience? I've heard the game isn't worth it if you don't do the network stuff (which I don't).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I played 'single player' for a while.</p><p>It is fun, and as with most single palyer vs multiplayer mode games, the single player mode actually has some real goals to it (like total galactic domination).</p><p>I used the single player to get acclimated to the game before venturing on-line.  I will continue to play single payer mode just to make it through the game (and get better so I dodn't get creamed on-line).</p><p>What I like is there is no real stategy, no over-thinking...you pick a side, and kill everyone who is not on your side.  YOu can use a variety of characters from either side of the battle, as well as speeders, tanks, X-wings, Y-Wings and other vehicles or air/space craft.</p><p>I am a big Star Wars fan, and in my opinion, this is about as close to Star Wars nirvanna Lucas (and Lucas Arts) will ever get.  (at least until the holo-deck is perfected, but we can leave that for another time)</p></div>
