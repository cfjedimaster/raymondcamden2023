		<div class="comment_text"><p>And you thought the MS/Apple/Linux holy wars were bad.  Wait until you get into TiVo vs. all the other DVR's popping up ;-)</p><p>I know this post isn't about your DVR specifically, but I couldn't help but notice how much you are digging the concept lately.  I've tried both, and have to say that the only thing really going for the DVRs provided byt the cable companies right now is the price (also, depending on the TiVo you have, you may not be able to record two shows at the same time).</p><p>One area I'm keeping a close eye on is Tivo's acquisition of Strangeberry.  The hype around this is pretty big with the basic idea being that Tivo has the software (and patents) to be the dominant player in the networked home entertainment biz.  Should be interesting to watch unfold...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recently got satellite TV from the provider who uses actual TiVO devices ;-).</p><p>I LOVE TiVO (though I imagine I would love a non-TiVO DVR just s much).  My wife and I can't understand how we were able to function without it.</p><p>By far the biggest fan, though, is my 5 year old son.  He learned very quickly that if he presses the big yellow 'Pause' button, he can go to the bathroom, and not miss anything.  It has also helped with the mini-tantrums he would throw when it was time for dinner.</p><p> &lt;whine&gt;But I wanna watch the rest of *insert show here*!!!!&lt;/whine&gt; turned into 'Can I pause it?', to which, I respond, 'Pause away, buddy'.<br>I may never watch 'live' TV again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure how we lived without our's either.  Some of my favorite features (TiVo):</p><p>1.  Pause live tv<br>2.  Remote scheduling (from the web)<br>3.  Streaming music from my other computers to the TiVo<br>4.  Streaming Pictures from my other computers<br>5.  The JavaHMO project<br>6.  TiVo's wishlist capabilities.  We use this for all sorts of things such as favorite actors and directors.  Also use it for cooking - put in an ingredient or food and it records related shows.  And for travel.  We put in "Malta" before our Malta trip and it recorded several related shows.<br>7.  I like that TiVo uses my ratings and viewing history to make suggestions.  It's done a decent job suggesting some art-house and foreign films that have turned out to be big winners.<br>8.  Commercial skip.  I just love this one.<br>9.  The TiVo remote.  This is one of the best designed remotes I've used.<br>10.  If you have more than one TiVo, you can send a show from the TiVo in one room to the TiVo in the other.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I too have the Motorolla DVR box from Comcast.  The only reason I got it was to record HDTV content.  I have had a Tivo for years, where have you been?  :-)  I will day that recording HD directly from the box works great!</p><p>The lack of funcitonality on the DVR compared to Tivo is very disappointing.  For instance, there doesn't seem to be a way to record a "season pass" like Tivo (all new episodes of a series) or even basic VCR functionality like record this channel every week at this time.  Without this, it is almost useless.</p><p>Now that Tivo is only $99 (plus service) if you like the crude DVR in the cable box, you should really try a full Tivo for a month.  Especially if you aren't in to HDTV yet, you will *not* be disappointed.  I bought one when they were $400 (plus $200 for lifetime service) and after the first few days, my wife loved it more than I did. :-)</p><p>The problem (if you will) with the cable DVR is that *any* DVR funcitonality is awesome.  It much easier to get it in the Cable box, and cheaper.  People like yourselves will love it.  They wont 'need' Tivo, wont buy it.  Since Tivo hasn't been able to work a deal with any cable company, they wont grow and may die.  And that would be a *very* bad thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tom - while I don't see an explicit "Season Pass" on my unit, it -does- allow me to record all instnaces of a show. It also allows me to specify new episodes only. It will also let me limit it to one particular channel. This should cover everything Tivo's Season Pass does I would think.</p><p>Also, doesn't Tivo have issues taping on a different channel? With the Cox DVR I can record on a different channel while watching something else.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - My TiVo box (integrated into satellite receiver) is fairly new, and it has 2 tuners, so I can record shows on 2 different channels at the same time, or record one show and watch another.  I believe its made by Phillips for the satellite provider that has 'NFL Sunday Ticket'</p></div>
