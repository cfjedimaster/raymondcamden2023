		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very interesting, as I am on the same system over here in New Iberia. I may just take myself over there and get a DVR box. The ethernet port intrigues me, and I wonder about the USB ports, too. Do you know anything about them? I wonder if you could hook  up an external HD through one of them to increase capacity, copy, etc., etc.</p><p>I'll be curious to learn more!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray -</p><p>Your post got me curious. I have a Scientific Atlanta Exlorer 8000. Several USB ports, firewire, flash and an ethernet.</p><p>I found *some* info online, and it seems like people have tried to connect to the USB ports and the ethernet port with no luck.</p><p>I did, however, learn that COX is planning (or has started) a roll-out of the Scientific Atlanta 8300HD - A high def and "multi-room" capable DVR and HD box all in one.</p><p>Aparently the box can work with "existing home wiring" for sharing recorded shows from room to room - causing me to speculate that they might use the electrical sockets for packet traffic.</p><p>I called BrightHouse here in Tampa, and they are nearing the end of their testing of the 8300HD. They told me to go to a local office with my current box and they'd give me a 8300HD at no charge.</p><p>Here's the specs for the 8300HD (165 gigs of DVR space!).</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciatl.com%2Fcustomers%2FSource%2F7004920.pdf%3A_05vDWuKdBQc0moxJGRf1AECwhA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.sciatl.com/customers/Source/7004920.pdf">http://www.sciatl.com/custo...</a></p><p>Call Cox and see if you can get your hand on one!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So here is a dumb question - where did you find your model #? All I see is Motorola. I'm also considering just calling tech support. I'm assuming they will be clueless, but you never know.</p></div>
