		<div class="comment_text"><p>What you going to do about <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffullasagoog.com%3F%3AgivZ-dGfahue4ELV_sdNrNmhOJs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="fullasagoog.com?">fullasagoog.com?</a> The one thing i think that works well is the break up of CF news in there sometime. Plus your link to that Battle of Endor game has kept me amused in the office :o)</p><p>Is your rss feed to the likes of Full As A Goog now gonna be CF only or you going to keep it to roughly on topic i.e mainly CF but anything else remotely on topic, IT related?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I start to read someone's blog, I like to read all of their posts, not just the technical ones - you get a better sense of what they are like as a person, what interests and drives them - and that in turn gives you more insight into the way they talk about technology.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No issues at all - although I'm planning a wipe/reinstall of music as I've done a lot of organizing in iTunes. The only drawback to it is that my new Mini Cooper doesn't have a tape player so I have to use a mini FM broadcaster to play it on the radio. Normally it is just fine, but being radio, I can hear the slight hiss. When I get some mad money I'll consider replacing the stereo with one that has an input on the face plate. But of course, all of this is not the fault of the Nomad itself. :) I also bought the Notmad Explorer software that some suggested and I _love_ it. I don't use it very often (the nomad is in the car) but the tools are very useful and I'm happy I have them around. Plus - you can set up a web server for your mp3 files which is nice.</p></div>
