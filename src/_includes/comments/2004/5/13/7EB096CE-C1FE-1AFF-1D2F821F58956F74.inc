		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another band I saw way back when, before they were big. Actually saw them on the tour for Rio, about 1 1/2 years before they 'broke'. They were one of my absolute favorite bands in the early 80's, until they got big and (in my opinion) changed their style for the worse. Just like Simple Minds.</p></div>
