		<div class="comment_text"><p>probably dumb question, but I should be able to look at this code above and figure out how to do this via ColdFusion? I have api's written in CFML that when we put it external will need Auth...this should work pretty easy?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few answers:</p><p>1) This is primarily client-side stuff so any back end is fine.<br>2) Bearer also supports working with custom APIs, so if you had an API built with CF, it could be used with Bearer. I haven't tested custom APIs yet, but I saw they were documented.</p></div>
