		<div class="comment_text"><p>Random spoiler musings:</p><p>Loved seeing Palpatatine. Loved it. His attack on the rebel fleet was *amazing*. This is the Sith power I've always wanted to see.</p><p>Was truly shocked when Rey used forced lightning.</p><p>Seeing Han was.... hard. Yes, I'll say it. As was seeing Chewie react to Leia's death. Oh, and also when he got his medal. (Although I believe this contradicts a comic from last year. Which I'm fine with.)</p><p>The voices of the Jedi thing was amazing, especially when you find out they used *multiple* characters from the cartoons. One thing Marvel has really dropped the ball on is embracing their TV shows. I know they are doing a 'reset' kinda going forward, but I really felt like this was a great shout out to the cartoons.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Your story is my story (minus the tattoos) and your feelings on the movies are pretty spot on with mine. Was The Rise of Skywalker the best movie ever, no, but I felt satisfied with ending of the saga.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was great. I think the last 2 films were really hampered by the loss of Fischer and the care that had to go into that hole. I thought "Rise" actually made the last three films a better set and was great closure. I loved Palps return (bold move) and the ships were exceptional as a fan.. Tantive IV(?) rising from jungle OMG. Happy where things landed, bring more Obi + Mandalorian on Disney+.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It occurred to me that the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything might just be "How many years do we have to wait for the Star Wars Finale?" Like you, I wanted nine movies when I was a kid.</p><p>I never thought it would be possible for Kylo Ren to redeem himself, but I'm happy with the way his story ended. I was surprised to see Harrison Ford back. I suspect if Carrie Fisher was still alive, we wouldn't have. Oddly, I think the thing I appreciated most was that we finally got to see the Force Healing power that first showed up in West End Games' Star Wars RPG. Yes, Baby Yoda got their first, but it was nice to see it on the big screen.</p></div>
