		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is a great write up. I have created an API and I wanted to write some documentation for it. Over the years, I have kept an eye out for a documentation orientated framework or CMS, like Confluence, that I can use for such a task. One, created in Coldfusion would be an added bonus.</p><p>I am sure that such a tool exists, because I have seen many documentation websites that look like they are using a generic system.</p><p>Do you know of any such system, that is available?</p></div>
