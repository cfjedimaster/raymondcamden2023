		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's not like there isn't a link back. To me, it's off loading some of the documentation work which makes it worth while. I asked him about embedding the faq as well and that is a planned feature (not sure it's 100% certain but it's being considered).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wondered what happened to Kaplan.  Used to read F----dCompany every morning back in 2000 - 2001.  He was branching out into some nice, reusable ad services even back then.  Glad to see he's still in the business, and with another neat idea, as usual.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunately, the one faq you put up there is a bit misleading.  If someone wants to know what it costs, they don't want to hear that it's free until you go live (still with no mention of cost).  In addition, the question was "How much does it cost TO DEVELOP using ColdFusion", and I would argue that it costs quite a bit, if your time is valuable.  If I were asking such a question, I'd want to hear "Typically, someone who knows html and some other programming language can pick up the essentials in 8 hours.  To become an expert requires..."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray!  Have you listened to the audio version of "Crush it!"?  I kept thinking of you because the author advocates blogging and social networking with "Facebook me" and "Tweet this" buttons.  What has been your experience with being the defacto ColdFusion blogger?  Gotten rich yet?  Apart from getting things from your Amazon wish list, have there been any other monetary rewards? Has it been worth it?  Will it be worth it to an aspiring blogger?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@PS: Respectfully - I wrote that in 5 minutes. Don't over analyze it. ;)</p><p>@PS2: That's a bit off topic, so I'll answer, but if you have more follow ups, let's switch to email. If you are specifically about what I call "blog bling" (to be fair, the FB me, tweet this, etc, can be used on non-blog sites too), then I honestly don't think it has a huge impact. Unfortunately I don't have a easy way to see how many times - as a whole - folks have FBed my articles here of G+'ed them. I'm sure there's a way to check, but I haven't bothered. When I do bother to look at an article, like this one for example, I see a grand total of 2 G+ items. I see no Likes.</p></div>
