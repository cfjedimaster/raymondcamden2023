		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like the idea of the Sony competition, but the offering seems a little off.  Rather than have 7 prizes + 1 grand prize, I'd prefer to have 1 not-as-grand-prize, 7 kinda somewhat nice prizes, and 100s/1000s(?!?) of good prizes (perhaps S2 or S1).  Sort of like the Playbook deal, but getting people to actually invest a little more time and thought into their app.  There were a few too many "random number generator" apps for the Playbook when it was released as people just wanted to get something submitted to get their free Playbook.</p><p>I pretty much *know* that whatever I write will not be on par with some shop that decides to enter their app vs. my little homegrown app, so a little way to level the playing field might be nice.</p></div>
