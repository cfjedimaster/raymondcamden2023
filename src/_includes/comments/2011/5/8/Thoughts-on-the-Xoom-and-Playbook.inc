I plan to test both devices with video (got HD movies on both) and will let folks know.</p><p>On a totally random note - I tried AirSync via my Inspire to my XBox. Wow. It's not perfect. Has some issues with buffering. But pushing out wirelessly from my phone to my Xbox is freaking neat. I should be able to try that via my Xoom as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - Thanks for the side-by-side comparison. My Playbook should be here tomorrow, and I'm interested to see how it compares to the iPad.<br>On the mobile site issue on the Xoom - I don't know if it would work, but there is a way to get some Android-based phones to report themselves as a desktop browser instead of a mobile browser. Paul Trani did a blog post on it a couple of months ago, so you might see if it will work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@shirak: You don't need one. Using my Xoom I hit this blog entry, clicked the PDF, and unfortunately it didn't render it right there, but it did download it just fine. I went to my Downloads app, ran the PDF, and it rendered perfectly. I think it's just built in.</p><p>@rob: I'm not aware of a way to do that. I think the Playbook actually _does_ have a way to tell sites it isn't mobile - mine isn't right by me right now and I don't think I've tested Gawker sites on it. I will though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When the Xoom first dropped I rushed over to Best Buy and played around with it.  I also fell in love, but didn't buy at that time since I was holding out for the WiFi-only version.  Now...we have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 on the horizon that might sway me from making the Xoom my tablet.  Unfortunately, the Playbook didn't wow me, especially with so few native apps and the reliance on having a blackberry to tether to it to fully "unlock" it's capabilities.  As with any of the tablets, whether they are iOS or Android...they still seem to be more entertainment devices versus productivity and entertainment.  What I would love is to be able to take this on the road, do work along with surfing, reading and some games.</p><p>Have you tried the Chrome Cloud Print option on the Xoom?  I wasn't sure if this was even an option or if it works.</p><p>Great review / comments!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Re: battery Life, I've had my Playbook for a week now, and my biggest complaint about it is the battery.  The Playbook doesn't seem to have a "sleep" mode, so it's drawing pretty much full power the whole time it's on as far as I can tell.  This means the longest I've been able to go without charging it was 10 hours.  I left it in my backpack at work the other day, and it actually was using so much power it got warm to the touch.  <br>   I've got a Viewsonic G-Tablet that I've been playing with for a month, and it's battery is great in stark contrast to the Playbok.  It takes somwhere on the order of 2-3 days to run down the battery on the G-Tablet, even with reasonably heavy usage, playing HD movies and such.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I picked up a Viewsonic GTab on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FWoot.com%3Az6U8lqNxGGw8gB5IN6ZO_R8eXmo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Woot.com">Woot.com</a> for $280.  You can get it on Amazon for $314.  The OS that comes with it is awful, but the hardware specs on the GTab are awesome. I Rooted it and installed VeganTab. VeganTab is very stable and everything works well.</p><p>So for those on a budget grab a GTab and load a better OS on it.  Rooting is well documented on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%3A4aIaA6RJuiQccDACB0JRR8PvGyQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="youtube.com">youtube.com</a> and other web sites.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Today I got a micro usb to HDMI cable and played with both the Playbook and the Xoom on my TV. I am not an AV expert so everything is just based on my casual experiences.</p><p>1) Playbook</p><p>The video out from the Playbook was perfect. Seriously. I tried a rip of Empire Strikes Back on my TV (42 inch 1080p) and it was incredible. I also just tried the OS in general, and a game or two, and it ran great. What impressed me even more was the wifi file sharing feature. The PB can be shared on your network which allows your desktop machines to easily copy files to and from the PB. Darn nice and -very- polished.</p><p>2) Xoom</p><p>This was a bit of a disappointment. The Xoom did not display perfectly out. The quality was good, but the screen was about 4% or so too small. In other words, things at the far corner of my screen on the Xoom were clipped on the TV. Audio was also ... smushy? It sounded off. Perhaps enough to be too annoying when watching a video. Maybe this will be corrected in a later update, or maybe I needed to tweak something, but when compared to how the PB worked out of the box, it comes up short.</p><p>Side note:</p><p>I tested the PB and Xoom via USB to my Xbox. The PB did not work at all. The Xoom showed up as a device for audio, but not video. Pictures worked as well.</p></div>
