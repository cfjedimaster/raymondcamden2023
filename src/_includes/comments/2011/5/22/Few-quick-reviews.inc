		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can recommend a really good zombie novel.  "Mort" by Rob Redux was excellent in my opinion.  A quick read as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Hunger games trilogy was excellent.  My son had finished them and I needed something to read so I started on the first one.  Wow, I couldn't put it down.  The first one is the best but the next two were good.  I thought it would be a great movie(or movies) but I still don't think they can make a movie to match the books.  Great read.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray you need to check out the Fables series by DC. Its a great and very different take on characters from classic fables. Imagine  Snow White, married to the Big Bad Wolf, and is a former serial killer. That sort of twisted plots.</p></div>
