		<div class="comment_text"><p>Despite my best intentions, getting up at 3:00 AM in the morning in Australia to watch the presentation was just too hard this morning.</p><p>As per the Mike Wilson experience, and even after reading your instructions, the SlideSix link to the presentation still takes a bit of poking around to find (not exactly the most intuative interface). Now I find I need some login other than my Adobe username and password to see it. Any ideas? Why is a username and password required to see it anyway?</p></div>

As I said to Mike above - that's what you click for the recording.</p><p>Unfortunately - as Chris has shown - the recording is password protected. I'm working on that right now. Being the weekend it may be a while though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have some more information. Not sure if it helps or not:<br>the 100 characters for summary is hard coded only for queries.<br>For files is 300 (as per Adobe help), also hard coded, meaning that ContextBytes has no effect.</p><p>For both cases the context is based on the summary which gets the 100(300) bytes from the beginning of the document. If the search item is not found in the first 100(300) characters the context is empty which pretty much makes it useless.</p><p>Imagine if Google searches will give just the beginning of the page with no context information about what you are searching...</p><p>Thanks<br>Mike</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi - my company is switching from a hosting plan that has CF 8 (Verity) to CF 10 (Solr). I set up my search collections on the CF 10 server the same way I did the CF 8 collections but noticed something odd when I searched against them. The context from the Solr search is missing or very limited even on results that have a summary and are high in the result set while the Verity context is always there. I've tried destroying and rebuilding the collection but that didn't work. I thought it might be similar to Mike's issue (09-19-2011 at 09:39 AM)but that doesn’t seem to be the case either (or at least I don’t think so) and I’m pretty sure that the collection is set up for highlighting based on what I see in the search results. At any rate – when I go into the CF Administrator to try to get it to enable highlighting – I keep getting this error “There was an error enabling highlighting for this collection. An error occurred when performing a file operation write on file C:ColdFusion10cfusioncollectionscontent/conf/solrconfig.xml.” (the error appears on screen lacking slashes where I would expect them) When I look at the Solr config file – it seems as though highlighting is enabled – at least according to what I see on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.apache.org%2Fsolr%2FSolrConfigXml%2F%3Ad6HCtw9ypn65z6hxAcWGkvGQEWk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml/">http://wiki.apache.org/solr...</a> .</p><p>I’m not sure if it has to do with how the collection was created, how it is indexed, or how it is being searched – it’s just a mystery to me at this point.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started looking at this again this morning and wanted to explore something my coworker found last week - an Adobe link that suggested updating the XML files - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.adobe.com%2Fen_US%2FColdFusion%2F10.0%2FDeveloping%2FWSe9cbe5cf462523a0-5bf1c839123792503fa-8000.html%3AjHUBf4OTTFD8S6a16aflVjIiamg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/10.0/Developing/WSe9cbe5cf462523a0-5bf1c839123792503fa-8000.html">http://help.adobe.com/en_US...</a>. When I logged into my server, I noticed that my co-worker who was helping me look into the issue had done the changes to the C:\ColdFusion10\cfusion\jetty\multicore\template\conf directory so I tried my search again and it was still missing a lot of context. I was searching against my “content” collection that is stored in C:\ColdFusion10\cfusion\collections\content\conf and it still had the old XML content. I stopped the service, modified the XML documents, restarted the service, purged the collection, then re-indexed it using some code I wrote (still not sure how to re-index a collection that is based off cfquery through the CF Administrator), then retried the search. It works now. :)</p></div>
