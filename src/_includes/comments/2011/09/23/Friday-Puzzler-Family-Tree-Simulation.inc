		<div class="comment_text"><p>My solution was pretty straightforward. I created simple methods for creating people, getting married and procreating and then dumped everything out in bulleted lists. This did indeed run long enough twice to kill my local CF server, but can also just return a couple of families - call it bad genetics. I'm sure there are 1000 solutions, and probably simpler ones than mine, but it was quick and fun!</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2Fmn4MUFVq%3AmPqPwAJnlrh6yQXuuIaFwMGVZsY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://pastebin.com/mn4MUFVq">http://pastebin.com/mn4MUFVq</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Zach's entry:</p><p>1) Kinda important mistake you should make note of - in App.cfc, you should use <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthis.name%3AEm-S9q6F4e-8KUeib7Eeo3ysjlY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="this.name">this.name</a>="...", not <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FApplication.name%3ARcKwivDmd3_zdTpc3r419fqXwIc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Application.name">Application.name</a>. That sets an Application scoped variable called name. It does not "name" the application.</p><p>2) Hmmm - interesting use of onRequest there. I normally do what you did in onRequestStart. But I kinda like how you used onRequest.</p><p>3) Hmm - I ran your code, but it only generates one generation. Was that intentional? Did you leave out something?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I appreciate the feedback. Those listToArray() function calls are a product of the "abbreviations" I have built into my editor (jEdit) - when I type "listtoarray" and press "space" then the full syntax for the function replaces my text. That's something I might change since 99 times out of 100 I use commas for lists.</p><p>As for the argument names you're right, I used shorthand because I know what they mean (identity, gender, family name and type) and I don't live verbose code, but they're non-intuitive for others.</p><p>Total oversight on the "s" ending on the names - that could have been handled so simply with an IIF().</p><p>If I were to refactor this I would switch to using implicit struct/array creation rather than longhand StructNew() and ArrayNew() - again, I need to update my abbreviations in jEdit or maybe take a look at CFBuilder.</p><p>It was a quick solution and I really enjoyed seeing everyone else's take on solving the puzzle. Thanks for putting this together - looking forward to future puzzlers!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>AXL:</p><p>1) I don't believe you need to set variables.*="" in your CFC. I think just the act of enabling accessors is enough. Now, you may get a null if you do getX() w/o running setX() first, so that (setting defaults) may be a good reason to do it.</p><p>BTW - your init function... next week I'm going to reveal something that will make that a LOT smaller in Zeus. ;)</p><p>2) Interesting use of a big array to handle randomness. Any reason why you just didn't use a randRange type check? Err what I mean is, something like randRange(1,10) &lt; 2 or some such.</p><p>3) Nice job on the display page. Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you for the comments, Ray.</p><p>1) I guess I tend to do variables.*="" things because of the book "Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion" I have read.  They are not necessary just like you said.  If I want to set default values, I could do that within 'init' functions by calling setters and getters.  It's just another way of setting default values to properties.</p><p>Interesting! I won't be at MAX, but Ben mentioned a live online thing at his blog.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fforta.com%2Fblog%2Findex.cfm%2F2011%2F9%2F25%2FSign-Up-For-MAX-Online%3A5HEOw-_ZKbZcwYaQBipvdQeoAfc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/9/25/Sign-Up-For-MAX-Online">http://forta.com/blog/index...</a></p><p>If yours aren't available online in some reasons next week, could you post some details in here?  I know you would do, but just making sure.  That would be awesome.</p><p>2) I like yours.  I just didn't think about that.  That's a clever way comparing with mine. ^^;</p><p>3) Thank you very much for spending time on reviewing my code.  It was fun and I really appreciate your feedback.  Learning something every day.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My preso won't be online immediately, but it will be soon I think. As for details - I'm working on a plan for that now. Stay tuned.</p><p>Btw... thank you all for not complaining about how long it took for me to pick a winner. Personally I like all the entries. These contests were always decided in a very arbitrary manner (it IS meant to be fun - I run, from time to time, larger more series contests where the winner is definitely decided more seriously) but I have as of yet decided who that winner will be. By lunch - I'll decide, even if I have to randRange to pick. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know What I think you should do. Give all of them who have submitted their code a free copy except me since I didn't submit it on time.  At least these five people spent a quit time on this puzzle to entertain, and come on in a few days it's MAX.  Can Adobe help you to have a little preopening party here?  Where did Oprah go?</p></div>
