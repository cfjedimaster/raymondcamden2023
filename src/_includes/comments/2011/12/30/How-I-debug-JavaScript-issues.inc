		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally, I'm amazed at how good the debuggers are for Javascript in the browsers. Chrome's Developer Tools are great with the Mozilla Firebug plug-in right behind. IE Developer Tools lack a bit, but what-the-hey.</p><p>Usually I'll look at most of our web offerings in 2-3 browsers and use the (native) debugger. If it is going to involve a lot of browser-to-debugger switching, Chrome is the best mainly because of the speed. Also, a dual-monitor setup is really necessary; but that's true for any real-time debugging.</p><p>Thanks Ray, and let's all have a great new year!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice article :)</p><p>We can talk about the "debugger" keyword, that lets us create breakpoints right in the source code. This is very useful in some cases:<br>- when you have a lot of big files and you don't want to search for the line in the script panel,<br>- when you have a system of build of your scripts, here the source &amp; generated code are different, and matching one with another could be hard,<br>- when you have a dynamically generated portion of Javascript (this is really really bad but I've already encountered it...)</p><p>Have you seen the videos from Paul Irish talking about using the console ? Here is the link <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpaulirish.com%2F2011%2Fquick-color-manipulation-with-the-chrome-devtools%2F%3Atx4oozXllIxgYtiZ5tX3ovFBUDk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://paulirish.com/2011/quick-color-manipulation-with-the-chrome-devtools/">http://paulirish.com/2011/q...</a> I've learn a lot from it :)</p><p>Also, sometimes, knowing the differences and evolution of the differents consoles (Firebug, Chrome Dev, Opera Dragonfly) saves time :)<br>For example, in Chrome you can activate a breakpoint when the user is doing an "mouse event", without knowing the relevant code, awesome :) This is shown in the videos I think. Also, Chrome lets you edit the code right in the browser ! Time saver :)</p><p>A last general tip, sometimes it's cool to create/edit/debug some code right from the console. I mean, you get a code portion you want to modify, you run it from the console, you see directly the result, and make modifications until you're satisfied :) Time saver too ;)</p><p>Hope this'll help :)</p><p>Cheers</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray (and others!).<br>Looking at the Net tab allowed me to tighten up a few things.<br>I had been loading jQuery with Google's jsapi followed by google.load, but the Net tab showed me that loading the script directly from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fajax.googleapis.com%2Fajax%2Flibs%2Fjquery%2F1%2Fjquery.min.js%3AmyXuj5h8gP7HzSEw76YxIcay7LQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">http://ajax.googleapis.com/...</a> meant it would load chronologically.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Whenever I'm debugging a javascript issue, I always start with the HTML now.  Does it validate?  Does it have a DOCTYPE?  Are there any duplicate IDs? Improper tag nesting?  These are critical issues that Firebug won't quickly reveal.</p><p>Initially a hotel client had complained that the fonts used on their reservation page weren't correct.  We discovered that the javascript font replacement library we were using wasn't working in IE9 because the webpage was in "quirks mode" because it lacked a valid DOCTYPE.  To make matters worse, there wasn't any way for us to add a DOCTYPE (closed source) and the application was no longer being supported.</p><p>For validation using Firefox, I recommend "HTML Validator".  It uses Tidy and OpenSP to validate locally on your machine without sending  HTML to a third party server.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusers.skynet.be%2Fmgueury%2Fmozilla%2F%3AZsubSNA_g7-pwtDOPLxucr9yQ70&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/">http://users.skynet.be/mgue...</a></p></div>
