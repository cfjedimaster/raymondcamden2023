		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Matthew: What BlogCFC is missing now (ignoring the ugly architecture) is easier templating. That's the only real feature missing. Personally, I want to add in custom fields, an _incredibly_ simple WordPress feature that allows you to add custom key/value pairs to blog entries.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll echo Ray's comments: The reason my blog is Wordpress (currently I'm writing a new version in node.js as a learning exercise) is due to the rich marketplace for themes, and it's a 15 second upgrade to a new theme once you download the ZIP. Perfection would be a Wordpress-to-BlogCFC theme converter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to wonder if you are beginning to distance yourself from ColdFusion. Your blog name has changed and you blog more now on various other technologies.</p><p>While I appreciate people need to move in different directions and learn different technologies, you taking even a smaller step back from ColdFusion will have a big impact. You IMO are the most well known ColdFusion person out there ahead of Ben Forta &amp; Ben Nadel.</p><p>Perhaps I'm being a selfish ColdFusion fanboy, but every hour you spend on phone gap etc is an hour less on ColdFusion.</p><p>I'm hoping the writing isn't on the wall.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To me, it's not stepping away from CFML, it's stepping into other areas that CFML can be the backend for.  Mobile is the next brave frontier.  The data that drives it needs to come from somewhere, and personally it'll be CFML driven for me ;).  I for one love seeing mobile based posts, along with pure CFML posts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dale: I think Matt answered well (thanks Matt). To me, many of my non-CF stuff ends up being CF stuff anyway. You will notice many of my jQuery posts come back to CF. Many of my mobile ones too involve CF. I love CF, but there's more out there and I think my readers want to learn about em. :)</p></div>
