		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Atan -</p><p>I think what he's saying is that the mask format is different only for the new function. Coldfusion would need a way to discern date vs. time placeholders. If you look, the only ones that are actually different are the placeholders that are shared between both date and time masks.</p><p>That being said, your HH:mm would still produce a perfectly valid military time formatted time string. However, If I am taking this in properly, "yyyy/mm/dd" would actually generate "2011/[current minutes]/21" It would need to be "yyyy/MM/dd" for use in this new formatting function.</p><p>I could be wrong on all this, though. Just a thought.</p><p>Confirmation Ray?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Since this is just a string value that tells the function how to format the output they should make the older functions for time and date formatting recognize the newer versions of the masks.  The masks for the combined date and time format function need to be recognized by the older functions so you can set global formatting variables for date and time.  I think this is what Atan meant by his post.  The old functions should still recognize the old versions of the masks for backward compatibility, however, having the new masks supported is something I see as a "no brainer" for the development team to implement and should not be overlooked.</p><p>-Az</p></div>
