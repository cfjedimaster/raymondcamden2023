		<div class="comment_text"><p>Indeed!</p><p>It's almost tempting to get the source of the browser for Android and incorporate a View Source action. Or at least, "Send source to" action. Alass, that is a while away for me yet!</p><p>Another thing for getting in to Mobile is just build *everything* you possibly can! The best way to learn something is by doing it after all!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is always my talk at 360Flex ;) I will be giving an overview of various mobile development solutions. Actually one method I judge a technical solution is the level of support/training from the company. With Adobe's backing of PhoneGap, I would expect to see more and more tutorials from them. I also find being about to explore a good 'kitchen sink' example app is nice solution. I usually have an idea in mind, and need to find the right parts to construct it. Appcelerator and Sencha Touch both have KS apps that you can explore.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was my question on Twitter that started all of this, so thank you to everyone for the advice.</p><p>In a nutshell, one of my goals for the next year from my performance review was to get into mobile web development, as management really sees mobile as a growth area for our clients.</p><p>My first thought was that I'd have to invest time in really getting down HTML5 because upgrading our sites from HTML 4.01 to HTML5 would be a logical step in making them "mobile ready", possibly with the need to redirect mobile users to a mobile version of the site that would use something like jQuery Mobile to connect to the CF backend?</p><p>I know I'm well behind the curve for getting into the mobile space, and it seems pretty daunting considering that I'll have to teach myself in the limited free time I have (I do have access to a training budget but it hasa lot of strings attached to it, but I think I can get them to purchase a Lynda subscription). So I went to Ray who's never let me down in the past for advice. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The one thing that helped a lot was getting DW 5.5, this is what got me started with mobile and phonegap. DW made it simple enough for me to understand the concept of phoneGap and JQM.</p><p>I would say though that it would help to have a good JQ foundation to really leverage JQM because as you get more into JQM you will see how important it is to have a firm grip on JQ for your XHR requests.</p><p>That being said I also think its important to remember that a mobile site is the same as any other site, just smaller :) It can be easy to forget that they are one in the same (unless you are using phonegap for phone features but still for the most part the same)</p><p>As you get more comfortable with it, reading the docs on JQM site is a really good learning tool, also just sitting back and giving yourself a project will help, just something simple like an rss reading etc, I think Ray has a tutorial on his site.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Via Appcelerator Titanium, like Phone Gab there is lot of information online, but they have a lot of training courses. best of all it's just JavaScript! It's not done through a UIWebView. Titanium actually compiles your application and uses the phone SDK to build a native application.</p><p>Can pick to use HTML5 content through a web view or not!  It does wrap your code around a Web Container and render web content in a native application, i.e like Phone Gap.</p><p>If you want a real "native" feel and to use your existing skills, then Titanium is easy to learn with lots of information online.</p></div>

I am using phonegap with Jquery mobile, and I finding really easy since I have a good background programming skills, HTML, js, css etc... and specially with Jquery and c# .net which is OOP and based on events. So all the events on jquery, and jquery mobile was quite easy for me to understand.</p><p>If it wasnt my background skills though, i would find it hard to learn because there isn't much good resources out there focused on mobile dev from begging to end.</p><p>by the way, your blog has been helpful a lot!</p></div>
