		<div class="comment_text"><p>Quick Question:  Does an "exhibits-only" pass to MAX get you into the Sneak Peeks and Meet the Teams as well as the general sessions?  If so, that's definitely the way to go with the Unconference agenda you've put together.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just called in, as the website didn't say either way.  Sounds like Sneak Peeks and Meet the Teams are not part of it (at least according to the person I talked with.)  Which seems strange, as you do get access to the MAX Party, which immediately follows the Sneak Peeks.  Any way you can confirm internally?</p></div>
