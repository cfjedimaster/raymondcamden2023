		<div class="comment_text"><p>Quick note - normally you probably want to post these comments on the cfpanel site. The CFPanel is run by multiple people so it makes sense to give feedback there.</p><p>That being said - remember that a panel discussion is inheritly different from a presentation. In a presentation you have one or two people discussing a topic in depth.</p><p>In a panel it's a group of people with different view points and opinions and is driven by the Q and A.</p><p>That being said - if you check Charlie Arehart's UGTV (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carehart.org%2Fugtv%2F%29%3AolcCqFJESVShhH3gyLZVv2sfmeY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/)">http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/)</a>, you can find numerous presentations on CF and jQuery since it is huge in our community. I'd also be happy to volunteer to give a beginners preso in the future.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Thanks for the information.  I do think a "Intro to JQuery newbies for CF server side programmers" would be very useful.  As it was said at the podcast (I think by you), It is a large learning curve breaking into JQuery - so a little boost would be very helpful.</p></div>
