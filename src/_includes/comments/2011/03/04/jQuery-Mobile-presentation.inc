		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't work much with mobile jQuery, Use in one my iPhone application where I want to display page from server instead of native form.<br>I think creating or extending widget is make lots of thing easier for us. Recently worked on extending Listview to render data from coldfusion query (JSON format) and it work great and love too. <br>Soon I will post on this. <br>Look for your presentation on meetup :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Why did you have to extend the listview? Seems like if you've got the UL there already and just add options after your ajax call it should work fine. Not that I've tried this myself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would love to see the full presentation, if you have a video of the talk or something.  The slides are great, but that would really be interesting.</p><p>On as side note, I like how the select menus change in jQM.  But I found that I could not get them to work with CFDIV areas unless I disabled the sexy select menu and went back to standard HTML selects.  Any idea of a workaround?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good thought.  I'm really new to jQuery.  I'll give that a try.  In all honesty, I'm so new, I need to read up on how to do that.</p><p>I had looked at jQuery alternatives to CF ajax stuff like cfwindow.  But when it came to cfwindow, it seemed I could not do some useful paramaters like:<br>&lt;cfwindow refreshonshow="true" destroyonclose="true/false" ...</p><p>I really like the flexibility jQuery brings, but some of those features were problems I could not find a workaround for.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,<br>That's true we can add options after ajax call but jQuery doesn't apply css in that case. We require to refresh with listview object. Also I always need to do repetitive code to convert return JSON format to display properly. <br>Basically I made it learn how to extend mobile widget.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, <br>Was a great preso, I was amazed at how easy the code came together to create mobile optimised sites. I kept waiting for the bit where you announced it was all a bit of a joke, and nothing could be quite as straight forward. (But that never came)</p><p>It looks like they have really thought about creating a decent framework around semantic markup, rather than the usual slightly tech orientated designs of the past.</p></div>
