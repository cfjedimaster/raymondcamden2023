		<div class="comment_text"><p>Since CF builder sits as a plugin in Eclipse, you may want to consider using the Eclipse API. It accounts for all of these specific issues plus it doesn't require the CF engine to work. The Eclipse API is a very well executed series of libraries, very thorough, and you can accomplish these things without producing anything that is "Mickey Mouse." Check it out, you'll be impressed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How is any of this Mickey Mouse though? I don't doubt that the Eclipse API is nice - but it requires Java knowledge. One of the big benefits of CFB is that it allows CFML developers to use their _existing_ knowledge to build extensions to the IDE.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yah but the cool thing is ColdFusion _is_ Java, right? But seriously, learn some differences in syntax and some new libraries AND remove the binding to the CF server and you're home free! Its a much better way to go. Oh yah, check out MXUnit's plugin for example.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Eric,</p><p>I don't know all that much about Java or the Eclipse API; but, what I can say about the Builder / ColdFusion integration is that I love that I can re-purpose the skills that I already have. Also, since you are essentially connecting to a "web app", you can just about build and test a Builder Extension outside of the context of the Eclipse context. And, since it's a web app, you can take full advantage of web standards, CSS, AJAX, and all the other awesome stuff that has made the web so popular.</p></div>
