		<div class="comment_text"><p>Any idea how PhoneGap compares to Appcelerator?  Would that happen to be the "certain other service" you mention?</p><p>I currently work for a large corporation building intranet apps and the fact that Appcelerator won't list their prices but has a "Contact Sales" button instead has been enough to scare me away. :)</p><p>I'll definitely do some playing with PhoneGap!</p></div>

I wanted to help them, I didn't want to spend months training Java again (It's been a while I don't use it). Now I will be able to join them using my expertise (Html, Javascript, Coldfusion).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's worth pointing out some pros and cons with Phonegap and Titanium Appcelerator.</p><p>Phonegap<br>------------<br>- PRO: write once, build to 5 different OS<br>- PRO: It's JavaScript, leverage existing code<br>- CON: code remains javascript, runs in a WebView component</p><p>Titanium<br>-----------<br>- PRO: Write once, submit to 2 different OS, with a 3rd in beta testing.<br>- PRO: JavaScript<br>- CON: requires custom classes and IDs (AFAIK)<br>- PRO/CON: Your code is compiled into native Java or Objective-C code and is truly a native app</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, Android's SDK is slow stating, however just use snapshot to solve this. Enable snapshot and it will start up from the last point without all that bootup crap.</p><p>Also give Titanium a go. Is so MUCH better than phonegap! phonegap is missing a LOT of the API functions.

As an experienced web and desktop application developer with an urgent requirement to get into mobile development, what route would you guys advocate?</p><p>I came across both Phonegap and Appcelerator Titanium whilst searching for x-platform frameworks, and based on the marketing bumph Titanium had the edge due to its greater native support, but I've seen so many complaints about the Android support now that I've been frightened off.</p><p>@mike hodgson, you seem to believe that these Titanium issues have been resolved.  Can anyone else back this up as I've seen some pretty horrific posts about the lack of Titanium support and lack of recognition of the Titanium issues by Appcelerator themselves.</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on platforms, frameworks, dev resources etc for an accelerated foray into mobile development?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Tawl</p></div>
