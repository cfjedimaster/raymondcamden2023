		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>I tried to read your review from my iPod touch. It showed your review for a split second and then switched to showing only 5 screenshots with no review. And I couldn't get back to your main screen. Just wanted to let you know since I know you're working on mobile stuff now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>While I have not gotten very far, I have to agree with you on Homefront. The graphics are not the best and I would say they are on par with games from 4-5 years ago - not 2-3. But, the story is so enticing its easy for me to overlook that.</p><p>I also love the 'tribute' to Red Dawn early in the game. (The story for Home front was written by the same guy who wrote Red Dawn).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't played Homefront, being stuck in Dragon Age 2, but I agree with your comments on Bad Company 2. The single player campaign was really excellent fun, largely because of the characterisation of your squad mates. So often with similar games it feels like the single player part of the game is a taster to the main course of online multiplayer, but in Bad Company 2 it really didn't feel like this was the case at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, definitely give Bad Company 2 multiplayer another shot. For me it's some of the most fun I've ever had in multiplayer. Of course you get to shoot guns, throw grenades and knife people, but you also get to resurrect, heal and reload other people's ammo. Then there is the vehicle aspect, driving a tank or being the gunner in a tank, flying helicopters (this is very difficult as they made the physics fairly realistic. Practice on an empty server if you want to fly) or if the helicopter has weapons then you can be a gunner. It's also nice to fly behind enemy lines and parachute out behind them to take them out. Last perk is if you are an engineer, you can help repair tanks, helicopters and any other vehicle when they get damaged. Hopefully you can get your multiplayer fixed and enjoy it!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did like the fact that Homefront was much more realistic, but like the movie 2012, I found it depressing in a couple parts.</p><p>The one part that bothered me the most was in the very first few minutes of the game when you're character is being transported on the prisoner bus you see a very small child (maybe 3 or 4 years old) who has to stand and watch as his parents are being executed.  Then the soldier/executioner went on his merry was way as the small child was left to grieve for his parents.  I know it's meant to show you the realism in the storyline.  I think it just hurt because I could picture that being my child (which I guess was their point - bring it home and make it feel real).</p><p>Other than that, I thought the rest of the game was pretty good.  It did remind me of Red Dawn a bit which was an awesome movie - almost as good as the book Tomorrow, When the War Began (1994) which recently came out as a movie as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jeff, that moment _was_ very intense, and yeah, I'm with you in imagining that in my own family. But again - it didn't feel out of place or gratuitous, and to me, that's the critical difference between the violence there and in other games.</p><p>The more I think about it - the more I think it comes down to the point I made about how the game feels like it treated me like an adult.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't had any negative issues playing BF:BC2 Multiplayer.  I love how easy it is to drop in &amp; out of games and change squads.  I always play with 2-3 friends &amp; we "shoot, move and communicate."  (My gamertag is GamesOver2600.)  It's not as fun when you are playing solo.</p><p>I enjoy the destructible environments (you can't hide in a building if it's being blown to bits) &amp; the ability to strategically re-spawn on your squadmates.  We recently had a lot of fun on "Oasis".  We all jumped in a CAV buggy &amp; drove circles around the enemy hitting them from all sides.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbattlefield.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FOasis%3A5L_u-bKbbx9-62WNp2VmqBxAmsE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Oasis">http://battlefield.wikia.co...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>James, thank you for bringing that up. I cannot believe I forgot the destructible environment aspect of BC2. It makes a big difference, and yeah, there were plenty of times when I was trying to hide in a house that slowly got blown to pieces. It really ups the excitement.</p></div>
