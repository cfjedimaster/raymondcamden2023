		<div class="comment_text"><p>In short:<br>When building large applications with frameworks like ExtJS, you are much better off learning the framework and using it directly.  You free yourself to upgrade CF without breaking your ExtJS apps, and you have the opportunity to implement regular framework fixes for problems you may encounter instead of waiting for Adobe to dispatch a hotfix (which probably will not come until a new major release of CF)</p><p>Explanation:<br>Having worked with ExtJS very heavily over the last 4 months...  While it may be convenient for little things here and there to be included in CF, it is generally not a good idea to build entire ExtJS applications using the CF implementation.  The CF implementation is updated extremely infrequently, and new browser versions are always breaking the rendering and behavior intended.</p><p>Another big problem is most CF implementations of ExtJS are not upgrade safe.  When you upgrade CF, your old app code may or may not work.  This is not really Adobe's fault, because there's plenty of things from say Ext 2.x that do not work in Ext 3.x.  But to be free to upgrade ColdFusion any time you want and not break your ExtJS apps, use the framework directly instead of the CF implementation.</p><p>If they did include ExtJS, I am mostly certain it would be ExtJS 3.x (probably 3.3.x).  The problem with that is ExtJS 4 preview is out right now, and everything changed.</p><p>If you want ExtJS, I recommend you grab the framework and work with it directly.</p><p>I am excited about CF X though!  New toys!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Simon, JRun is fine but it has been years (perhaps a decade) since it was updated. By virtue of time and use Tomcat currently offers more promise both now and in the future. The transition of course will be a matter of QA to be considered. I wonder why we are not dropping Flash Forms, unless of course we are finally going to open that door to a full Flash enabled (Flex, etc) option in the new server.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If they are removing JRun in favor of Tomcat, I REALLY hope they will port the connector developed for JRun over to work with Tomcat.  The native Tomcat connector does not work as well, especially with IIS 7.x in Server 2008/2008 R2.  There are also problems with properly co-existing with URL Re-Write modules and other nagging issues that "just work" with the native JRun connector shipped with ColdFusion 9.</p><p>If they (Adobe/ColdFusion team) could contribute a connector back to the Tomcat project that is as robust as the JRun connector it would be a BIG benefit both to ColdFusion, since it will maintain that same level of connectivity to the web server, but also to Tomcat in general (especially anyone using Tomcat on Windows with later versions of IIS).</p><p>Later,<br>Az</p></div>

Dumping Jrun is a good idea. It wouldn't look good if CFX sat on top of a long dead product. Maybe CFX can utilise features that Tomcat has that Jrun didn't, on top of the speed improvements.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>While most will be glad (and reasonably so) to see CF move on to a more modern underlying java server platform, I just want to correct John F's comment that it's been "perhaps a decade" since JRun was "updated".</p><p>To be fair, it was updated as late as 2007 (in its updater 7, more at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftjordahl.blogspot.com%2F2007%2F09%2Fmore-jrun-updater-7-info.html%29%3ALGltuClRDjMsFR5L5FVDbE05dSo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tjordahl.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-jrun-updater-7-info.html)">http://tjordahl.blogspot.co...</a>. How many people still run in Windows 2003? Or even use Outlook 2007? :-)</p><p>But yes the base JRun 4 did come out in 2003, and no question, the consolidation of the J2EE server and servlet engine market left JRun behind, and it was indeed EOL'ed finally in 2009.</p><p>It served CF pretty well even after that (though many would argue to the contrary), but it is indeed finally time to move on. There will surely be benefits, though as Ray says it will likely be rough going at first as we make the transition, though I'm sure the CF team will try very hard to avoid that if possible.</p><p>Anyway, I just wanted to salute JRun and play Taps one last time before the party starts over its gravesite.</p></div>

The change from Jrun to Tomcat is good, ScheduledTask and cfjob features nice, but for me i can not find any big announcements or something great. <br>We are using CF 9. It works well. The change to Tomcat is nice, but not important for me and i think for many other developers too. I hope they make some changes to cfdocument, cfimage, cfpdf or things that bring CF to another level and more interesting for PHP or Java developers. With the features above there is no need for an upgrade.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally, I never ever used JRun anyway on production servers. Tomcat6 has always been my goto, it's a far cry in configuration -- and it makes many CGI variables useless when using apache in reverse proxy mode.</p><p>But, even with jquery, jquery ui and over 200 files being loaded and various objects and queries running... my entire page loads in under a second according to both chrome and firefox. So, speed? It definitely has it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunately I couldn't participate at Scotch on the Rocks, but sounds really nice to me.<br>Didn't try Tomcat yet, but as I can read from the comments people welcome this change. <br>Some of the scheduled task improvements were already overdue in my eyes. Good to hear, that there's a big step forward.<br>It's also fantastic, that jQuery seems to be integrated. I already use it for some years and don't want to miss it anymore.<br>I also just know closures from JavaScript, but I am also sceptical how useful they will be in CF.<br>Besides all that I'm really curious about which other new language features will be integrated.<br>If they also implement some of the suggestions I made in the bug tracker, I'll be completely satisfied! ;-)</p><p>Sebastian</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Closures in CFML should allow for more abstraction and thereby less repeated code. Another benefit of closures is that it will allow Map-Reduce type of functionality which is what Google and other large-scale apps uses to handle scalability.</p></div>
