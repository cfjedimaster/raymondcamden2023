(If I didn't say that above, than I must have been so upset I wasn't thinking. ;) I also tried 2 different universal remotes.</p></div>

Once, when I thought I had a display issue, I got help via their twitter account (@viziosupport). <br>If you bought it at Costco, you should be able to return it to them if it is within 3 months of your date of purchase. Also Costco's Concierge line (866-861-0450) might be able to help.</p></div>

Volvo Customer Service have a great approach - they love it when their cars go wrong because they can demonstrate how good their customer service is, and they reckon they retain more customers by the quality of their service than by the quality of their cars....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just got off the phone with Scott Patten, director of Tech Support for Vizio. He apologized both for the tech who didn't check the schedule _and_ for the tech who didn't explain things to me last night. He was very helpful, nice, etc, and gave me his contact info in case I had further issues.</p><p>After the call last night I was pretty pissed, but I'm happy with Scott's response, and Vizio in general now. I'm still hoping the fix is quick and easy on Wednesday.</p><p>I hate it when folks complain about something and never mention the positive so I'm hoping this update clears things up. (Going to edit the blog entry itself too to ensure folks read this comment.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to read that @VizioSupport got you on the road to satisfaction (hopefully). It's kinda weird to get better customer service from an 'impromptu' environment like twitter than from their actual customer service center. But this seems to be the trend (at least for me). With Comcast, I always get more rapid and satisfactory responses from the great Comcast folks (e.g. @ComcastBill, et al) who monitor twitter than I do from my local call center.</p></div>
