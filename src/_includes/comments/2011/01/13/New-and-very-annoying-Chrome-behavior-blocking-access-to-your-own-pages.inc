		<div class="comment_text"><p>I almost like the sound of it but think the implementation isn't quite there. Certainly, ignoring localhost or anything resolving to a private ip would be a good start. Even better would be an interface right there for the user to instantly turn it off, either browser wide or site specific.</p><p>Good job it's beta eh, perhaps they'll respond to the outcry :)</p></div>
