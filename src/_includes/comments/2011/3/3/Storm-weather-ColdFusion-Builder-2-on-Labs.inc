		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm excited about this one! I'm trying to love my CFBuilder 1, but I have issues with it, it's not as fast as my old and very loved CFStudio 5, so when I'm doing a lot of coding, I always go back to my first love. Daily I try to love CB1 and it's great for a lot of stuff, like wireframing (WireframeSketcher by Petru Severin). Speed has been my biggest issue with it and I'm running a beefed up laptop.</p><p>Thanks for posting the article, I'm off to download it!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Asking this here because I posted it to Twitter, but didn't get a reply, and I know your blog gets a lot of eyes: Does anyone know how to reset the trial period countdown on the beta? I've been using Storm since the prerelease, and as a result only have 6 days left on the beta. Un-install/re-install doesn't do it.</p><p>It would be nice if the betas would reset the countdown when you install each new build, or at least provide a longer grace period that would get us to the commercial release.</p></div>
