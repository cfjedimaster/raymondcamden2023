		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gallery is good, but I still recommend taking a look at one of the very excellent dedicated video players such as RockPlayer that go beyond the capabilities native in the OS, including mkv playback, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well thank you! Captain obvious or not I hadn't figured it out and just googled to find the built in player and you've given me the answer.  I did find a few problems with Gallery though. One was that for some reason it doesn't show the file names of the videos, or a preview.  Other apps do this. Secondly the playback was a bit jumpy especially for high res files that it has to convert on the fly (and on a single core processor on my tablet). Just played with a free app ES player and it was noticeably less jumpy.</p><p>cheers<br>Simon</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad this was helpful for you Simon. I agree on the file name issue. I had about 20 episodes of a tv show and it was impossible to tell which was which. I'm using Rock Player pretty exclusively now.</p></div>
