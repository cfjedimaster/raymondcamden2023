		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to ask who recorded these videos, apart from sounding like a robot. The guy is giving a bunch of false information, that could be totally misleading to a new developer.</p><p>Like notice how it has stepped over the code without executing the code, this is actually false. Although I understand what he really means, others are going to go what I can step over code without executing it how cool is that:-)</p></div>
