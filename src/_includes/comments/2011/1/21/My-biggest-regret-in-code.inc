		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Scott, <br>More enjoyable in a few ways, I feel more apart of Railo.<br>traditionally I find a bug in cf I raise it, never hear anything again, it might be fixed in the next release in 2 years time.</p><p>Railo, I speak to the actual dev who builds it, he tells me if its a bug or not, I raise it, then about 4 days later I grab a build with that fix and I don't even need to install it I just go to "update" in my admin.<br>month or so later its in a stable version and I update the servers (from within the admin with one click) on my websites to the stable version with latest fixes, traditionally this could take years.</p><p>Also there was something I wanted railo to do differently then the way its done, I was told if I want to make the change for my own copy of railo then to ask and i'd be shown where the code is that needs changing.</p><p>To sum up I'm a developer, a lover of fast changing tech and a person who likes to know whats going on / whats coming up etc.<br>all the above is enjoyable for me</p><p>I have nothing against Adobe Coldfusion, I use it daily at work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to say my biggest regret is not contributing to open source projects. I guess it's because I don't feel I have anything new to add or what I'm coding is too specific for a narrow market. Pretty much since I started 13 years ago, I've always worked on custom apps.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My biggest regret is not being proactive and spending my own money to take classes to remedy my gaps in knowledge of stuff like databases, programming logic, etc.  Hint - even if your company has a policy of paying for employees to take classes and such to keep their skills upgraded, don't take them at face value and expect that they'll live up to it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, time to purge.  I came from a Windows app world writting everything in C#.  I never wanted to do web apps because of browser differences and I had already tasted that nasty pill in the past.  A job offer came along that I couldn't pass up for a web developer position, with myself being the only employee.  All the previous web pages were written in CF.  I had never used CF.  All I had to go on was examples from the old site files, and they were basic and crappy.  I used cfinclude for everything.  I also had to REALLY learn CSS because the last time I did anything for the web, everything was tables.  So, when I found out about application variables I was pumped.  What I didn't know was that those variables applied to the application instance on the server.  I thought there was an application instance for each session.  So, needless to say, I was storing user info in the application scope.  Luckily, a lot of those projects died rather quickly.  It also took me a while to learn what the heck Application.cfm and Application.cfc did.  I look back at some of the code I wrote and thank my lucky stars nothing really bad happened.</p></div>
