		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, if you're having a hard time getting started with the hiking, forget about doing it for yourself and take your kids geocaching. There are a ton of kid-friendly geocaches out there and they get to have fun and explore and "treasure hunt" per say.</p><p>Some geocaches are setup in such a way that when you arrive at the spot, there's a fun little binder with instructions to "walk x-steps to the west, hop 5 times to the left, etc" (read: like an old pirate treasure map).</p></div>

However, you won't be able to see them without the proper diet. Have you looked at P90X?

It comes with tons of libraries which make it easy to plug in exactly what you need.  It is object-oriented, yet doesn't force you into that if you are more comfortable writing in a more procedural style.</p><p>There is an outstanding community surrounding Python, very similar to ColdFusion, although I would dare to say much larger. I tried to bring it into our City when I was there, since they decided to move away from CF, but the powers that be were seduced by Microsoft salespeople.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A good bit of Ray's 'resolutions' are my own. Okay, they have been part of 'resolutions' with very limited progress. Last year I had resolved to <br>1) Eat salmon at least once a week. I think this is about 10% success by the end of the year.<br>2) Jog for at least 3 miles each time, three times a week (on an exercise bike). Mostly successful<br>3) Beer gut be gone. Well, it is mostly gone but that's because I have become very lazy in fixing food.<br>4) Learn Flash Media Server and/or Wowza Server in depth. No progress after January 2010 because of various other $$ projects.<br>5) Fish and/hike at least once a week. Very little progress. Whatever I did was mostly walk along my favorite river near Rocky Bottom, SC. Once I tried swimming in it in July but was too cold. May be this year in August.<br>6)  Read one of Ray's co-authored books about ColdFusion (I think it is the 'Anthology' one, bought from Amazon a few months ago). Barely begun.<br>Ray: We really appreciate what you do on this site!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Getting rid of the beer gut is the same as any weight loss. Calories burned &gt; calories consumed. The gut is just the last place for it to go away for men. Adding push-ups and sit-ups, or any weight-bearing / resistance exercise, is good because it builds muscle. Muscle burns calories when at rest and when in use. Thus, more muscle burns more calories.</p><p>So does running longer distances or doing any calorie burning exercise more often and for longer periods of time. And consuming fewer calories helps with the amount you have to burn. I hope I wasn't stating the obvious here, just keeping it simple.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Matt: Nah, it all makes sense. Not sure if you are aware of my "history" (I feel egotistical when I assume folks do), but 2 years or so ago I lost 70 pounds. So I've come a long way, but I feel like I have room to grow still to help "polish" me off. The gut is the main thing. I drink about 4 or so beers per week, normally 1 or 2 on Friday and Saturday. I think I may try cutting that to about 2 per week.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>All sound like good goals, Ray. I've also been in the 'lose the gut' resolution crowd for a while... with some decent progress.</p><p>I did notice a couple comments talk about reducing calories to help with this.  If you're doing serious exercise (&gt;= 1 hour a day, 3 times a week or more), you may want to take some time to make a detailed nutrition plan or maybe consult a personal trainer / nutritionist (good PTs are also nutritionists).  At that level of activity, less calories in does not equal more weight out.  In fact, you may be hindering your weight loss progress if you can't finish your workouts or keep up the right pace.  The key is to get the *right* amount of calories daily from 'clean' food sources, while making progress in your workouts to build your muscle mass and reduce the fat (Matt W said this pretty well).</p><p>Don't get discouraged either.  Matt W also has it right where he mentioned that the gut is the last place for results in most men; losing the gut may take some time.</p><p>Good luck with all your resolutions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Weight Watchers rocks for a diet. It's the only "diet" I've ever done that actually stuck, because it's flexible and gives you lots of options. And if you formally do it thru the program, you also have "peer pressure" thru the weekly meetings. I've watched friends suffer thru diets restricting weird things, while I ate much more comfortably and actually lost the weight.</p><p>I have friends who had pounds melt off by running. So stick to your first two goals, and they'll happen simultaneously. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, I was aware you had dropped some pounds, but couldn't have given the details. My weakness is sugar and sweets. About 2 years ago I started running pretty regularly (4-5 times per week, usually 6+ miles). I can just about eat what I want, though I do try to keep it somewhat healthy - very little soda and fast food.</p><p>If you look around your area, you may be able to find a running group to meet up with. A lot of people don't like that idea, but I've found runners in general to be open and encouraging to new folks. Even if you can find just one person who runs close to your pace it can be very motivating.</p><p>Good luck and Happy New Year.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>P90X is a series of high intensity workouts that target specific muscle groups. It doesn't go by Upper, Middle, Lower, but mixes it up such as chest &amp; legs or biceps &amp; back. One of P90X selling points (and some others like it such as "Insanity") is called muscle confusion. The basic idea here is to change the routine up every 3-4 weeks so your muscles don't get "bored" so to speak and resist growth. Think of it like jumping from JS to CF to SQL to Flex often. You stay fresh on all of the above.</p><p>P90X is a one hour per day, 6 days a week program. It has a three or so routines that all last 90 days (hence the 90). I have not done it, but did some research and may try it one of these days. They did recommend that if you are not used to doing weight bearing or resistance exercises (stretch bands) then you may want to spend some time getting comfortable with that first or even do their less intense series Power 90 (no X).</p><p>One more note if you want to give it a try, look on Craig's List for this or any similar program. You can easily buy it for half price or better.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just an FYI, I "finished" Couch 2 5k this week. 3 days of 40 minute workouts that include 30 minutes of jogging. I hit just over 3 miles at 'jog' speed. I don't on pushing it much more - if at all. I do think I'll add situps next.</p></div>
