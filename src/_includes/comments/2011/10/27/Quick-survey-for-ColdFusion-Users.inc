		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wouldn't you know it, this survey came about 2 weeks to early for me.  I answered it as our system stands today which is no use of the cfchart tag.  But I have just been asked to work on mocking up a new dashboard page that would have charts on it and thus would most likely be using the cfchart tag.  I look forward to digging into the cfchart tag over the next couple of weeks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've always used cfchart but recently we were in a rush and used SQL Server Reporting Services to bang out some charts really quickly using CF to alter the URL params to change the datasets and act as a proxy. The GUI to design charts is excellent (it gets way better with "Crescent" in SQL 2012) so I really hope CF10 can step it up a gear.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not sure "Do you modify/create chart style XML files or use WebCharts3D to create chart styles?" is a Yes/No answer rather than xml/webcharts <br>Do you mean "what do you use to customise ?" or "do you customise" ? <br>I went with 'yes' as I do, and I use WebCharts and then hand edit the XML to make it a sane size.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Of course, perhaps the intent of the survey is not to gather information but to disseminate it.  ... in the tradition of push polls with questions like "On a scale from 1-5, how aware were you of candidate Smith's insidious attempts to undermine democracy?"  Now we're all suddenly talking about jazzing up our charts.  I tell you, it's a conspiracy.</p></div>
