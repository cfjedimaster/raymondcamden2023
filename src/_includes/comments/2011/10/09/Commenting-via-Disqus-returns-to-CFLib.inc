		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 for disqus. I use this on my blog that is otherwise 'serverless' (just static html files served from a CDN). So easy to implement and a joy to use.</p><p>One side-effect is that your YSlow score may suffer a dent with all the extra js and css that gets downloaded. Something you may or may not be bothered by.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've used Disqus on my blogspot hosted blog a while ago. It was much better than the integrated commenting system. Also, I've integrated it with a CodeIgniter project a few months ago and I liked it a lot. The only contestant I see is Facebook comments, but it has it's pro's and con's.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 for disqus, which I use on my static blog. Another downside  though is that it doesn't support code in comments very well. Hoping they'll fix that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just started using Disqus a few weeks ago and was also impressed at how quick and easy it was to set up. Just a few minutes. One thing I really liked is that there is a way to import your existing comments and export all your site's comments in Disqus in an XML format. It is nice to know that should you change to another system (including your own) in the future, you won't be losing all of your site's comments. That is a very smart and thoughtful feature.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hello Ray!  Would you be so kind to share a few details of how you integrated Disqus into the CFLib site?  I'm evaluating Disqus for use at our CF site rather than creating our own.  Tips and your experience with it would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers, Loren</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome Ray, thanks!  The <a href="http://disqus.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="disqus.com">disqus.com</a> support docs had only a bit on ColdFusion, in particular the "one sign in" (which could be another post on how to implement).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I just looked it over, and I didn't really do anything. I hate to say "I won't blog it", but, all I did was paste in their code. I remember using their tool to edit a few options, and if you want, I can share whatever options I used for the site, but the actual implementation was -literally- just me pasting in their embed.</p></div>
