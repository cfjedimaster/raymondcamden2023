		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, the issue is still not patched yet? I posted the two workarounds back in May when I encountered it while I was playing with the newly released ColdFusion Builder 2.</p><p>Someone also mentioned that it had existed in a beta version.</p><p>It's a pumpkin month now, so it's been around for a quit while.  I guess it's time for you to knock on their door for a trick or treat.  I will let you wear whatever you like. ^^;</p></div>
