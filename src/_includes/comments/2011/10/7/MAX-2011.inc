		<div class="comment_text"><p>Did they talk at all about ColdFusion in the Keynotes, or anywhere else (sneaks, ect)? I did not get that feeling from twitter or blogs...did I miss something, or does Adobe really want to focus on Flash/HTML5, tablets, and just let CF be a separate being? Seems from your unconference attendance, a bunch of people were that that use or are interested in CF.<br>Thanks to you and all the folks that kept the rest of us updated on what was going on at MAX.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There were a few official CF sessions at MAX, including mine, but do not forget that an Unconference was dedicated to CF and we had quite a few CF sessions. :)</p><p>The keynotes did not mention CF, but they didn't mention other products either. I don't take this as a bad thing at all. To me, the keynotes are more about the high level view of where Adobe sees the future of our business and other important things. The lack of CF doesn't mean CF isn't important. Not at all. CF is well positioned - as it has always been - as a way to create services for Flash content and - of course - to work with HTML5.</p><p>That's my take.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The conference was good, but I was a bit disappointed that ColdFusion wasn't mentioned in any keynotes or sneak peeks this year.  In fact, there weren't a whole lot of CF sessions this year to choose from (except from the Unconference - which was great).  I'm wondering if most of the ColdFusion sessions in the future are going to be the Unconference - maybe it will spin out and be it's own conference??  I liked the UnConference, but I'm hoping in the future it'll be a bit easier to hear (being so close to the other ones at times made it hard to hear the main speaker).  I was wondering if they'd get a room dedicated to them, but Ben Forta mentioned that they liked the fact that it was more casual.</p><p>Anyways, good job with the UnConference and MAX overall was good...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had a great time at MAX again and I love the fact that it has grown to include all things Adobe.  I think that this year was about new directions and CF, as much as we love it, is not taking the company or most of us anywhere new.  It just works and we like it that way.  Unfortunately, that means some of the artsy folks don't get to see how easy CF can make their lives (or their developers' lives).  I met an individual who does mostly design and he had no idea CF could generate a PDF.  Based on our brief conversation, he could have used that info a year ago.</p><p>I am in the pre-release for PS Touch (frickin' amazing) and Proto blew me away. I think the thing that completely changed my perspective on touch apps was the price.   I really thought PS Touch was going to be a $60 (59.99) app and was a little disappointed with its capabilities even for a version 1 product.  For $9.95, it's a Grand Slam.</p><p>IMHO the CF Unconference was too crowded and noisy for any real learning to take place.  The upside is I attended a variety of sessions (Illustrator to InDesign to Photoshop to Flash Builder) and have already started using some of the lessons to my advantage.</p><p>mtc (my two cents)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In terms of noise, I agree with you both. The basketball game right by us was a HUGE mistake. We knew we were by the 'fun' area, but didn't realize that those loud games would be right there. We will be having a 'post mortem' on the Unconferences and you can be sure I'll bring this up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This was first time at Adobe MAX and thought the whole thing was extremely well run. I thought you guys did a great job with the Unconference. For me, the best session was the Fishbowl session that Tim Cunningham hosted. Even though it wasn't one of the sessions that taught me this great new technology, it taught me a lot about the ColdFusion Community itself. It was great to see that so many developers have the same passion that I have. They want to be build this already great community and turn it into something that we can be really proud of. It reinvigorated me and my passion to want to help build this community in any way that I possibly can. Thank you for all of the hard work that Ezra, Scott and yourself put in at the conference. I'm looking forward to the next one that I can make.</p></div>
