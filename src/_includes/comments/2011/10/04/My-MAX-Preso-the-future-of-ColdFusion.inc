The video ends a bit abruptly though.</p><p>Also, the syntax for looping over a query in script would be way slicker without parenthesis:</p><p>for row in getstuff { }</p><p>instead of:</p><p>for (row in getstuff) {}</p><p>... maybe I've just been working with Python too much lately :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So it definitely looks like the video is cut off. No idea why guys. I'm going to see if I can give it again, perhaps via Charlie's online meetup, but I've got a few other upcoming presos that I'm _way_ behind on and need to focus on. It would not be for a few weeks.</p><p>I can also say that I'm hoping to start a blog series, probably on Monday, where I go through these features one by one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Great information!</p><p>I know it's not the "sexy" stuff, but in my opinion, the really great new features are the security stuff.  Many of us have spent a lot of time over the years writing complicated workarounds to fix some of these issues that are now getting baked-in support.  If you could do a security series, it would be awesome.</p><p>Some quick feedback that you may be able to give Adobe - "invalidateSession" and "rotateSession" would be better as "sessionInvalidate" and "sessionRotate". (nounVerb instead of verbNoun")  It's more consistent with the other functions we already have (imageNew, imageResize, fileOpen, fileWrite, etc) and it also keeps the functions "grouped" better in documentation, easier to find in auto-complete lists, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good presentation mate, cheers.  What did you go on to talk about after the video cuts off?</p><p>I presume you chatted to people in the bar afterwards... what were people's thoughts about the features you presented?  What are people going "cool!" or "hmmm..." about?</p><p>Cheers again.</p><p>-- <br>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You mentioned me a new feature (implicit constructor?) in your &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coldfusionjedi.com%2Findex.cfm%2F2011%2F9%2F23%2FFriday-Puzzler-Family-Tree-Simulation%3Apa9KcDLZKY_VTvjihPuAG5TSp_I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2011/9/23/Friday-Puzzler-Family-Tree-Simulation">http://www.coldfusionjedi.c...</a>" target="_blank"&gt;Friday Puzzler: Family Tree Simulation&lt;/a&gt;.  I saw it on your 'preso' slide(CFC implicit constructors, method chaining, implicit notation), but it was cut off and I couldn't see the part.</p><p>It's not a very exciting new feature comparing with other security stuff you presented, but it would be nice if you can talk about it here.</p></div>
