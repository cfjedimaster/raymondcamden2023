		<div class="comment_text"><p>As I mentioned in your other blog entry, debouncing events is a great way to handle double-clickers too. If you have some functionality that you find people tend to double-click to start the event, debouncing the event can be used to cancel the multiple clicks.</p><p>This can be very useful on sites where you do a lot of AJAX-based updates and don't want to fire false events.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>I need a help on one of the jquery issue.I'm unable to find out the solution of that.I'm very new to jquery.<br>I have a form and in that i have 'ADD,Update and search' buttons.Using search button, i'm populating the form fields and then when user clicks on the update button, he can update those populated form values.However the moment when i clicked on the update button,the focus is going back to search click event again.update click event is getting triggered but after that it's automatically going to the code inside the search click event.I written code for each button in their own click events only.I'm not able to find out why it's happening.I tried different things ,like after populating the form values [disabling the search button,removing the search button from DOM itself] but no luck.Could you please suggest how to handle this situation.Thanks in advance for your help!</p></div>
