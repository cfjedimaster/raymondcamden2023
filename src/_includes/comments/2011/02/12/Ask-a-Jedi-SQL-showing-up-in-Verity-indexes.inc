		<div class="comment_text"><p>What??? I could not disagree more. Just because Solr doesn't ship with a spider like Verity did does NOT make it useless. I can't remember the last time I needed to use a spider vs just indexing data. I'm not saying that there are times when folks would rather use it, but I don't think it is close to being the majority.</p><p>And - if you want - you can simply download Nutch, the OS spider - and run it yourself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Doesn't that mean it is still useless for indexing public CFML pages, unless you are using the Nutch crutch to stop search results like, Hello #firstName#</p><p>A good presentation the other night too (apart from the sound quality), although I feel I have just wasted a day on something I have no current use for.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How many people prefer indexing their web pages versus indexing pure data? Take this blog for example. I'd much rather index the blog entry text from the DB then indexing the entire HTML page. The HTML has menu crap, advertising, other stuff. The DB _just_ has the blog entry.</p><p>Again - I'm not saying it is unheard of to use a spider - Google does of course. But for your own search engine, I think most people would rather index just the particular data they want.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Take a look at Nutch. Or wait for me to blog on it. ;) I've been meaning to for a year or so now. Once I get past MAX I'll have more time. In theory, it shouldn't be difficult to make use of Nutch and still use cfsearch to search the content.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Had a quick look, but being predominantly an IIS user, nothing makes much sense. I think at the moment, I will just look forward to you blogging on it, and save myself the possibility of a brain haemorrhage :)</p></div>
