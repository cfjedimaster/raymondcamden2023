		<div class="comment_text"><p>ha, yeah just posted it on my site too, thought it was great and a nice change from the typical game trailer featuring all powerful space marines blasting everything in sight... you really feel that this guy is fighting to save his family and he probably won't win!</p><p>Take a look at the recut linear version, strangely I don't think it looses much...<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DktT9DXs88HA%3AtE1w2PkfiIqSIQHKqD0c2eADbFQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktT9DXs88HA">http://www.youtube.com/watc...</a></p><p>By the way, thought Prey was excellent and played it through a couple of times, didn't have a problem with the kids stuff in context... if anything this video is more disturbing because of the emotion involved, that's not some random kid it's his daughter he can't save who then turns on him and he ends up killing... that's pretty dark really!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's very visceral in a family way to be sure, and I think it should almost appeal more to a parent/older player than a younger one.  There are plenty of books and movies where the loss of a child is part of a character's background, motives, or burden.  Here, it looks like they're going to put you front and center to that moment, and be a part of that narritve, instead of just having it installed as a plot point.  I think it has the possibility to be very effective.  I think to shy away from putting it in as an active part of the story you feel at a gut level, should give someone pause the next time the hero says "...and I lost my daughter," and we just accept it device and move on.</p><p>That said, it reminds me how kids end up with more of games like this in their hands than they would be able to walk into a rated R movie.  I think it's easily a trivial moment to most players under 25, and trivializing it gets engrained the younger the player is from there.</p><p>All that said, I'd a) hope parents wouldn't be such tools to not watch what their kid plays, and b) would definately play it (if it doesn't suck).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've watched it several times as well.  The musical score was amazing.  The first time I watched in silence since a coworker was on the phone.  It just looked like a rather well edited cutscene.   Cue in the music on another watch and I was emotionally drawn in, chilled and saddened to the point that its effect lasted long after.  In fact, as long as the song stayed in my head.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If the quality of the trailer = quality of the game, this could be a really good one.  DISCLAIMER: we've all been fooled by trailers before.</p><p>Either way, this VERY effectively evokes parental sympathy (rather than excessive disgust).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a father of three young girls (9,6,3), I found I had to remind myself that it wasn't real - several time. I think you are totally right that once you start having kids, everything changes with respect to killing and horror and gore. Give me a good psycho-thriller any day.</p><p>Of course, the whole gaming thing in general is out of control - its becoming more and more death fantasy and war p0rn...</p></div>
