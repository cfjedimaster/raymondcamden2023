		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't have a stutter issue, but I've had several friends with the condition through the years, and that "difference when presenting" is an interesting note.  A good friend of mine had a strong stutter in high school, but through college became convinced that he needed to be in the ministry.  Eventually, he did pursue that goal and he has never had an issue with his stuttering while actually presenting, even in front of 500+ people in a large church service.  It's fascinating what our brains seem to be able to do and not do, even when we seem to have no insight into what our own brains are doing to us.</p><p>As always, thanks for sharing (and thanks to JG as well).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I had no idea at all; and, I've talked to you one on one a number of times.</p><p>I was watching a documentary about stuttering one time and they found, at least for one patient, that if you hear a recording of your voice AS you are talking (using a feedback loop), it can really help.</p><p>Clearly, you manage your stutter; but, I thought you might be curious to try that out for yourself. Maybe it would even be a fun little FLEX Project - to take in an input and then pipe it directly back into the output. I think there is supposed to be a tiny delay in the input/output feedback loop though.</p><p>Anyway, just thought it might be interesting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Right after I finished my Master's degree, I worked on a 2 year research fellowship with the Hollins Communications Research Institute (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuttering.org%2F%29%3AQWl0QR7rnp-rwQj4QEn3kuuoDc4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.stuttering.org/)">http://www.stuttering.org/)</a>. Their Hollins Fluency System is a very effective form of therapy for stuttering.</p><p>When I did the data analysis looking at the effectiveness of the therapy program, we found that immediately after the 19 day very intensive therapy program, well over 95% of the participants spoke fluently. Over a two year followup, that percentage was well over 75%.</p><p>You may want to check out the program: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuttering.org%2F%3A25MjgYoOpo1EppJOELhG4Bu-KUQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.stuttering.org/">http://www.stuttering.org/</a></p><p>larry</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I've never spoken with you one on one but have listened to several of your online seminars and get together's.  I have never noticed any issue with stuttering in the least.  I would imagine this is a tough thing to get over and you have done a great job.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was affected by stuttering while growing up. My parents sent me to a speech therapist to see if that would help. It did help a little, but it wasn't a cure-all. The speech therapist said that my brain would formulate sentences faster than I could talk, and because of that I would stutter. As a kid I would really stutter if I was excited about something and trying to tell someone. My father would tell me to slow down and pronounce each word. (It is the same thing that Bo Jackson does)</p><p>As an adult, I'm affected sometimes when I get excited about something that I'm passionate about. But it does not affect my day to day communication at work.</p></div>
