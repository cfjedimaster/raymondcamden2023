		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am thoroughly in favour of this developer week project, Ray.   I was a bit critical of the Evangelists Super Blog when it first got started, becuase I saw plenty of posts, but almost nothing on Coldfusion.   Now I take it back - this is A Good Thing.   I am glad the topics list some for beginners,  some for middle level, and some for advanced developers too.    And almost all of us need to explore areas of ColdFusion we haven't used before, even if we have many years experience under our belts.</p><p>I can't catch any of these sessions live - I'm already committed for that week, but I'll be catching them later....</p><p>Thanks.</p></div>
