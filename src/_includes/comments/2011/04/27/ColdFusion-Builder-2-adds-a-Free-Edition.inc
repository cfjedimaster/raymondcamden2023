		<div class="comment_text"><p>RDS covers 2 main features:</p><p>1) Ability to browse tables and write queries.<br>You can the query part by right clicking on a cfquery tag now and using the newer SQL editor.<br>You could do a new view for that with an extension like John suggested. (Damn good idea John.)</p><p>2) Browse remote files<br>a) In theory you could use CFFTP with an extension. Unfortunately you couldn't open a file in the editor and support saving it back remotely.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My servers sit in a data center and my primary means of managing my CF files is with RDS. It seems like there could be a work around to get RDS back on the express edition. However, if FTP &amp; local file support are also removed it just seems like Adobe is making it more difficult to use for simple file access. I would totally pay for CF Builder if connecting to a remote server (for debugging) was possible without a VPN.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bummer (re: Local files).  This is a show stopper for me as a Free edition for even casual use.</p><p>Doug, I'm still using HomeSite 5.5+ too.  I tried DreamWeaver CS5, but didn't like the "end-of-line" function kicking me to the end of the entire block, some other navigation inconsistencies &amp; the local/remote copying/confirmations.  Too bad Adobe hasn't made any updates available for Homesite for CF9. I know it was discontinued in 2009 so that they could focus on CFBuilder.  Maybe they can sell it off.  It's still better than many of the editors available.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Because the local files I'm accessing are on multiple servers located on the same network and accessible via UNC path.</p><p>I've been using an awesome file manager called Total Commander since '96 (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FGhisler.com%3A9CcAZV9gZsHfwEY-5fAl1pq-gSM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Ghisler.com">Ghisler.com</a>). It's still better than any of the native Window's "file open" or CFBuilder's project management dialogs IMHO.  I can double click or select any file(s) that I want to open, and they are opened in the assigned programs.  I have lots of helper apps added to the menu/toolbar that further simplify working with XML, CSV and comparing files.  I have "2 keystroke" bookmarks to all accessible servers and sub-directories. Forcing me to use the CFBuilder project management windows locally severely impacts my ability to navigate &amp; manage files efficiently.  I know that using a "project" will identify all included and related files, but I don't need or miss this feature.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I pre-ordered Flash Builder Premium upgrade (from 4 Premium - $50) and it also said May 2.  I don't know if has been mentioned in many places, but the Adobe Creative Suites that include Flash Builder will have the Premium version of Flash Builder in CS5.5 - this means they will also include CF Builder 2!  Pretty cool if you already have one of the suites (Web Premium or Master Collection).  It could make the price of the upgrade more reasonable if you do not have CFB yet.</p></div>

It would be very good if they included CFB2 as part of the "WEB" Premium edition - after all, it's used to create web applications!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As long as ColdFusion Builder doesn't support HTML5 and throws errors all around the place if you dare to use it, the whole product is pretty damn useless I'm afraid, free or otherwise. How can you write CFML without HTML? Shape up, Adobe!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>CFBuilder 2.0.0's simple find/replace on a single file will not work for me via a ColdFusion RDS connection. Actually the problem only shows up for file types other than .cfm.</p><p>For example, I cannot do a simple find/replace on a .css file in builder across RDS. Have you come across this before at all Ray? It's keeping me from being able to use the product.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I never use RDS for editing. Sorry, can't help you there. I'd just search your local copy of the files, which should be the same as production (one would hope).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I wish I did have a local copy of the files, but development is being done on a remote development server... hence the issue. It would be nice if the feature worked, but oh well, Dreamweaver still does so I'll just use that and uninstall CFBuilder - no worries.</p><p>Anyhoo, thanks for the article.</p></div>
