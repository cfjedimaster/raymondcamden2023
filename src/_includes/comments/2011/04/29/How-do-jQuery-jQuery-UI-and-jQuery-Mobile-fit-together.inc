		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, no, I wouldn't. Also, I think your comment is misleading. Your code isn't just getting the value - it is getting the numeric value of something that may or may not be numeric. It's not fair to imply that JS is lacking anything here (imho).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So if you want to have your site available on a computer and on a mobile device, you need your basic logic and then the presentation pages specific to the type of device, right? Your "browser" pages would be written using jQuery and anybody coming from a mobile device would get pages written in jQuery Mobile.</p><p>Seems like a lot of extra work, but I can see designing the base functionality so that just the presentation-specific items are built using the appropriate toolset.</p><p>Do you have experience/recommendations on how you have handled the dual-coding issue?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@paulCarney - keep in mind that jQM 'sites' are going to address at best 30% of the mobile market in the US. And even that 30% starts to break when BlackBerry 5 - which yes, some consider as a smartphone, enters into the equation. So it's no longer a question of 'dual coding' if you need to address the entire mobile market - you're now into XHTML-MP to build at least a minimal experience for fliphones.</p><p>If you're trying to hit Android, Win7, iOS and new BlackBerry - jQM is a great choice and you'll have something prototyped in a few hours.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Paul:</p><p>If you're using an MVC framework to build your web app, you should only need to create mobile specific views. The controllers and models would be shared between the mobile and non-mobile versions.</p><p>Check out the "skinning" example app for FW/1:<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fseancorfield%2Ffw1%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fexamples%2Fskinning%3AK7J3bSU9nAvcK5BP69fiveHyd1M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1/tree/master/examples/skinning">https://github.com/seancorf...</a></p><p>That app isn't mobile, but uses the same concepts.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@cfgurney: Are you sure about the 30%? Last time I checked iOS+Android was around 50% by itself - and that's not counting for the % of BB that works well in jQM. Also keep in mind that jQM breaks 'very' well (in terms of people still able to read/use your site).</p><p>@Paul: I think Mike does a good job answering your question. A properly MVCed site will NOT be a complete rewrite for mobile. I think there is some room for debate on if you should have 2 sites or 1. Personally I think 2 sites because I believe that you can offer a streamlined experience on mobile. What I mean is - I think what you want to offer up to your users may change if they are mobile.</p><p>Keep in mind - I've been a "mobile developer" for 2 seconds. I'm still working to figure out what's best. I think we _all_ are. There's going to be a lot if experimentation and a lot of mistakes...which I think will be fun. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 2 cents: surely Mike is right, a site can be displayed differently from the same model, but i think that some functionalities does not make sense on mobile: imho a complex multitab form to compile a complex order or invoice surely will never be properly rendered on a smartphone; on the other hand a snapshot info, i.e. how many products i have in order, can be usefull along the way.<br>what i'm try to say is that imho mobile and desktop are not two different way to see the same things, but are additional.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks, @Mike - that helps understand some of it, but at @Salvatore points out, the ideas I struggle with are that the presentation and subsequent processing (what fields may be available, etc.) go beyond he presentation layer and affect the processing layer. I still think that desktop and mobile are different enough that I am having difficulty figuring out how to reconcile it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Paul, imho the way to reconcile desktop and mobile is to evaluate what do you need from a desktop session, may be all features, and a mobile one, may be a limited and simplyfied set.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think it's an issue of "mobile" as much as "touch friendly".  jQuery Mobile is a "touch-optimized" Web Framework for Smartphones &amp; Tablets (according to their front page.)  I'm creating admin tools for a client's Windows 7 tablets using jQuery Mobile &amp; Chrome because it provides a clean, consistent UI that is extremely touch friendly.</p></div>
