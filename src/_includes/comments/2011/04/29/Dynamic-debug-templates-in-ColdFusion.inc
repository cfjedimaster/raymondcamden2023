		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been monkeying quite a bit lately with debug templates as I've been playing around with Chrome extensions and trying to come up with something like ColdFire for Chrome.  I find myself using Firefox less and less these days, but sorely missed having the ColdFire capabilities in my browser.  It's been an interesting exercise and, while there is still some black magic in there that I don't fully understand, working through what you guys had done with ColdFire helped a lot.  Unfortunately, Chrome is still missing a few key pieces to be able to do everything that was there in ColdFire (like ability to get/set http headers) but it should be coming in the next Chrome dev release.  Anyway, I plan to do more experimenting as Chrome matures a bit and see if I can't work some additional pieces in like viewing server logs.  I definitely recommend that anybody spending a lot of time doing CF development customize the debug templates to suit their specific use case.  There's nothing scary there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jeff, you will be happy to know that Google is adding support for extensions to their dev tools. ColdFire for Google will _definitely_ be possible soon.</p></div>
