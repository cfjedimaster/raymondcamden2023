		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Rey: The awesomeness of the two Ray/Rey's meeting was too epic for a mere blog entry to contain. ;) In all seriousness - it was very cool to meet you finally. I should have also called out Microsoft's sponsorship of the conference. Thank you and the big MS. :)</p><p>@Ryan: Thank you for the kind words. I was a bit nervous presenting to this new (to me) crowd so I'm happy it went off well.</p></div>
