		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ha, man I always crack up at the things you poor CF'ers have to struggle with. Why don't you guys knock some sense into Adobe? Don't they know you totally depend on them to think of and do everything? You guys should demand better treatment considering all the evangelism and free PR you give them!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Mark: I bought a few Robotech comics, but not many. I did buy _all_ the novels though. I've only seen a few of the cartoons, but I love the story.</p><p>@Topper: Um... seriously? Maybe I'm reading you wrong, but it sounds like you are saying CF developers can't do anything unless Adobe does it for them. If so - that doesn't even make sense. This blog entry (well mainly the one before it) shows how easy it is to extend ColdFusion.  I'm going to assume you didn't mean to - but your comment comes off pretty demeaning.</p><p>@Joseph: I actually forgot that demo - thanks. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I collected pretty heavily in high school and a bit into college and then I stopped. In the past year I've gotten back into it again. I'm mostly just reading GI Joe but picking up random other comics. A guy in town here is actually a creator - he is doing the Sweets limited edition series which you should check out if you can.</p></div>

You kids nowadays have to depend on fancy cars to get you places ... whats next? Enterprise level rapid application development frameworks that can make easy easier? How dare they ...
