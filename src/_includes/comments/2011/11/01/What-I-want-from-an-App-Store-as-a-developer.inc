		<div class="comment_text"><p>The biggest thing for me as a dev is not on the dev side per se, but on the consumer side. Success of an app currently comes in one of 2 ways:</p><p>1. You are a big name company who is able to get their app on featured pages of app stores.<br>2. You have enough clout that you can use word of mouth to get your app out there.</p><p>Beyond those, you have to be very lucky in order to have an app that earns more than a few dollars. So what I want from an App Store is better DISCOVERABILITY. Right now, your app gets buried so deep that it's impossible to find, and app stores like Android Market don't even allow for multiple levels of categorization (or other means) so I can actually find it.  You have to click through pages and pages of apps and 99% of people aren't going to do that.</p><p>Maybe this isn't as much of a developer issue, but since I AM a developer AND I am also the one trying to sell the app, I think it's valid.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First off, +1 to Philip's comment:  I think we'd all like better exposure for new apps and new developers.</p><p>At least Google lets you read the comments in your developer console screen.  As far as I can tell, as a Nook developer, the only way you can read user reviews/comments is by viewing your app in the market on your Nook Color.  The desktop web version of the Nook Color market doesn't even show reviews, just the star ratings (yet oddly you can write a review).  If that really is the case, that's completely ridiculous.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I definitely share @Phillip's frustration regarding the difficulty of finding what you're looking for in the app store.  Churn-inspired or not, I'm shocked at how limiting the search interfaces are.</p></div>
