The Edge interface uses timelines and behaviors in a spectacularly intuitive manner, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it yet to make the download and give it a spin.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Phillip: Obviously Edge does something you can do by hand. That's not the point. The point is that Edge allows you to build it visually and opens up this type of feature to folks who may not know how to write out jQuery by hand. Shoot, even ColdFusion could be done in Assembly. ;)</p><p>@Simon: I think it makes sense for us to focus our time and energy where it best makes sense.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@phillip - lightbox is a specific package built around "ajax" components AND Edge is a tool to rpaidly build out those components.</p><p>@kyle - Edge is geared towards HTML5 and CSS3 so yes it will in deed break in IE7.  You'd have to go back and tweak things to function and look correctly in IE7 (and maybe in IE8 as well).  BUT then again if you did not use Edge and hand coded the same thing - you would still be doing extra work for IE7 and 8 as neither of them handle HTML5 or CSS3 very well or at all.</p></div>
