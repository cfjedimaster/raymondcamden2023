		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sal, what do you mean by mvc-mvvm? I know what mvc is - but I've not seen that before.</p><p>And yeah... I do string manip WAY too much. I played with jQuery Templates once, and AngularJS uses templating. I just can't be bothered most of the time for small demos like this.  But it (my use of it I mean) IS a bit ugly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you are a teacher for me and, i think, for a lot of others; i'm shure that many other developer, and i, are very interested in code writing best practices: this is the only sense of my comment.<br>MVVM: model-view-view-model: a sort of change of mvc pattern described by knockout.js( do you know? what about?)<br>My best compliment and thanking for your awesome blog and contents.<br>regards</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sal: Fair point. It's a struggle sometimes. When I blog on X, I try not to let things get in the way and distract folks. Sometimes that means I don't always follow 100% best practices, but I think for a blog entry you sometimes need to be more practical, know what I mean? It's like posting an HTML example and not having the _entire_ HTML page with doctype. If I wanted to quickly demo the &lt;b&gt; tag, for example, I'd be fine with &lt;b&gt;Ray&lt;/b&gt; and _not_ a complete file, since 99% of the code wouldn't be truly relevant.</p><p>Hopefully that makes sense. ;)</p><p>So MVVM... knockout.js would be the best place to leanr about it?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, it's all right.<br>You can learn about mvvm on wikipedia, knockout.js describe this pattern as a way to make an ui and a model , an object, 2-way dependant: imho is an application of the observer pattern.<br>have a look to this framework, expecially to the 1.3 RC: i think it's very good, simple yet powerfull but your opinion would be better.<br>regards</p></div>
