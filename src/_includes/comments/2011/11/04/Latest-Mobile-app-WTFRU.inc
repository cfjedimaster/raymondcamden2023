		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice and useful idea. I think it would be cheaper to implement if you could somehow just send the html for the page to your friend, without the need of a server. Otherwise, you would have a running cost that can only be financed in the long run with ads, subscriptions, etc. It wouldn't work with sms, of course, but maybe by email?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, this is a nice idea, but suppose that your friend does not have a smartphone, but only a simple ancient phone(only text sms) you could send to him only your exact address, evaluated with the first part of your app.<br>regards</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry Ray, but I don't understand your reply. My point was that, instead of sending your location to a server, and then a link to your friend so he can get the location + a map from the server, you could just produce the same web page in your smartphone and then send that to your friend, without the need to have a server in between.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, or as an attachment. It would take a little bit of experimenting to see what's possible and has better usability. I think the running costs of having a server would make real-life massive use of this app unsustainable. However, you don't "really" need one. The only absolute-must server-side processing (the map) is done by Google. What your ColdFusion server does is just to compile an HTML page that mashes up the maps based on your geographical coordinates; this can also be done in your phone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, but how would my phone generate an HTML email that includes your address? I don't know where you are. And html email is -severly- limited on most clients. I don't believe you can do any JS at all.</p></div>
