		<div class="comment_text"><p>looking at it now its even easyer, everything that the feed name starts with Channel. so "Channel LSV: MIR VIS WTH Draft #2". if you only see the latest 10 there are two videos. going back further you get "Channel Conley: MSS Draft #11" then even older there is one that has a different naming structure: "Magic TV Top 8 of the Week: Best Lands" I dont know if the video is in all the feed. permissions issue from the computer I am on right now</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK in the Magic TV one the video is embedded in the feed but since the update they did recently th video is not in the feed as far as I can tell. from what I found it seems they changed from using a youtube player to a flash player that is embedded in the code. there are other sites as well that do the same thing. but most of their video is premium content and that might not be legal so I wont even try.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can use CFHTTP get the HTML. Ensure you have resolvePath set to true. It will convert images like this: src="images/foo.jpg" to src="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.full.com%2Fimages%2Ffoo.jpg%3ApyJc852LieBpGIj0hnlKnu_Qc9Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.full.com/images/foo.jpg">http://www.full.com/images/...</a>" (WARNING TO READERS - my blog auto converts URLs to clickable stuff, so if that link goes to something naughty, don't blame me.)</p><p>Then you would use a regular expression to find all image URLs. You then use cfhttp to fetch each one and save it. The only issue you may run into is name conflicts. So a HTML page can easily have these two images:</p><p>/misc/foo.jpg<br>/people/foo.jpg</p><p>When saving these you need a way to handle that. You can do a few things.</p><p>a) Simply rename all images to UUIDs. Simple, but you lose any context about what the images were.</p><p>b) Increment. So the first foo.jpg is foo.jpg, the next is foo_1.jpg.</p><p>c) Mimic the directory structure. Given my example above, you could also create a misc and people folder.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>An RSS feed is XML, not HTML. It can't render anything. If you are saying that you want RSS readers to render the image, then you need to include the HTML in the RSS content. So you don't just include the url, but the html. Ie, &lt;img src=".."&gt; Then the RSS reader would render it. But an RSS reader may choose to strip out html when displaying.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Again - your RSS reader may strip out the HTML. Looking at your code, you are setting linkhref to the image. That is not right. linkhref is meant to be the url of the resource, ie, what the rss entry should link to. RSS Readers will link to it, nothing more. You want to use the "description" field to include your image there. This is a block of text that can include html.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Misty, you need to read the docs on CFFEED. cmap is used to associate a column in your query to known parts of a RSS feed. You want to:</p><p>a) Modify your original query to add a new column that will be your description for your rss items.</p><p>b) If you call the column description, then that _already_ maps to an RSS item, and when you generate the rss feed, it should work.</p><p>c) Not only is your cfmap.title line wrong, even if it worked it would be more wrong. Sorry if that is blunt. But your title field is just that, a title, not a block of content. That is what your description is for.</p></div>
