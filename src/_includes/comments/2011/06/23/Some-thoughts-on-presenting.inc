		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great post! I agree with everything except "Even something as innocent as iTunes." Since when has iTunes been innocent? ;)</p><p>As someone who speaks but doesn't like to do it, I would emphasize as you do that it's a learned skill - the only way to get more comfortable is to keep doing it. That said, some of my early presos were fill-ins for people who dropped out. Bad idea. I didn't have enthusiasm for the topic and that combined with my being new/uncormfortable with speaking was a bad mix. Finally, find some presos you can reuse/rework. I find the more I give particular presentation the more I improve it as well as get comfortable with it (and thereby present better). You'll save yourself a lot of prep time and get better in the process.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Excellent points. I would also add a bit to it of my own experience on presenting and teaching on various subjects. First, you have a lot less time than you think. Minimize the presentation to the core of what you are getting across. One hour is a very short time to go into detail on most subjects. Working out the timing is important and your presentation will become shorter as you edit it. The audience will not sit in rapture for more than a hour or so.<br>I outline my talks, but in a schedule rather than points to be made. Usually, schedule and talking points can be the same, but not always. One of the worst things is to get to the end of your time and have 25% of your talk remaining. That is why scheduling is important. Better to be shorter and have more time for Q&amp;A than to rush through in the last 5 minutes.<br>You can video yourself giving the talk these days with so many gadgets we have available. I have heard of people doing that rather than asking their spouse or friends to sit through it.<br>It doesn't happen every time, but some times you will get an "expert" who sits in the front row and tells you all the things that works for them and how they would do it "their way". You have to deal with these folks since most of the audience has come to see your presentation rather than theirs. Usually, I address this up front in a presentation or workshop telling them that I appreciate that others may be versed in the subject, but people came to hear how I do it. Otherwise, you can plant some big fellows in the audience to do a beat down on those folks if you can.<br>I'm sure others will have other ideas. Excellent blog Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, that's an excellent question Phillip. I give a bunch of them  and frankly - it's difficult. First off - on a personal level - this type of communication always makes me stutter a bit more. I also have stuttering issues on the phone too. Maybe it's the "talking to someone I can't see" issue. I don't know. But it's more difficult for me to maintain a "speakers voice" if that makes sense. It's also REAL hard to gauge interest. In a normal presentation you can see smiles, blank stares, etc. It makes it easier to judge if you are going too fast, too slow, etc. You fly blind on Connect.</p><p>Random thoughts:</p><p>a) If you give it at work and work in a cubicle, it's going to cause noise issues. Try to get a meeting room instead. By the same token - don't assume you can give it at Starbucks. Treat it like you would a recording session almost.</p><p>b) Anything motion based, like effects, are going to be a bit spotty. If your preso is heavy on that you want to account for it. Perhaps using slower effects than normal.</p><p>c) Invest in a good mic. Nothing expensive, but pick one up. To be honest, I get by with my laptop mic. But I also wear headphones while I present just to help keep down on feedback.</p><p>That's all I can think of now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is all helpful stuff ... I've taken a class on professional communication for software engineers, and we covered pretty much everything you mentioned here.</p><p>From the little experience I've had, I'd definitely emphasize practice. The average person has no idea how much material it takes for him to give a one-hour presentation, or how long she can talk on a particular subject. Write up something, practice it, note the time, adjust, polish it until you can get it within striking distance of your allotted time. (When in doubt, aim short; better to have questions, even if you need to plant a couple, than to cut things too short.) This is especially important if you're like me, and you a) talk quickly under normal circumstances and b) talk even faster when you're excited or nervous or something.</p><p>We were advised not to hand out a slide deck, associated materials, or anything like that before the presentation. If you give people something to read, they will read it, not listen to you, whether or not it's directly related. Instead, make copies and have people pick them up on their way out, or even better, post a URL where they can get a copy of the deck (or whatever it is you're passing out).</p><p>Don't worry if your first few presentations aren't good. Most people actively dislike public speaking and will appreciate that you're even trying it; some may make fun of you for presenting "poorly", but forget them, they'll probably complain about something no matter what's going on. If you get interesting and/or important information across, that's what people will remember. If you become a memorable presenter, so much the better.</p><p>When in doubt, arrange for refreshments. (Ideally not in the same room as the presentation; motion will distract the audience.) If you can't enthrall them, bribe them. I'll sit through just about anything if you give me cookies.</p></div>

On a good day I'll get double - or even a triple. But I accept that I'll do "OK" most of the time. And yes - sometimes I strike out.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it is good mention that you don't have to be an "expert" on a topic to give a good presentation on a topic.  In fact, experts tend to forget the common assumptions that normal people make.  Sometimes being a newbie on a topic and sharing the challenges and false assumptions you made are far more valuable than expert dissertation on technical details.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Don't hate me, but don't forget about using proper grammar.<br>In your first paragraph in this post, you improperly use "there's" instead of "there are" twice.  It's no big deal in forums like this, but it's not something you want to do in a presentation.  A representative from the University of Chicago came to town and presented to a group of aspiring students,  including my son, and I counted about 16 grammatical errors that he made before I gave up.  He had written several books.  It happens, but I also left unimpressed with his presentation and ultimately the University of Chicago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Public speaking is truly terrifying for me. Especially in situations where I have to have a sign language interpreter. Not only do I have to think about what I'm talking about, I also have to make sure my interpreter is conveying my message properly (especially if said interpreter is not used to technical terminology). Last time I did public speaking was when my co-worker and I had to talk about what we learned at CFUnited. I'm afraid I made a mess of my portion. And make sure people address their questions to ME, not to the interpreter as in "tell her that . . . "</p><p>Maybe someday . . . if I can get over my stage fright and can get my "personal" interpreter like Marlee Matlin has (she has used the same interpreter for years for her public speaking appearances . . . she can afford to do so).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Last year, NCDevCon had about 20% female lead sessions. It wasn't a gender issue as much as trying to give new people a chance to present on some new topics. I don't think Dan had an agenda in that direction, but everyone was in favor of the outcome. I went to Daria's preso and learned some things about caching.<br>Of course, the biggest issue is getting women into local user groups and getting women to do presentations at UGs. That is a first step towards getting on the larger stage mostly.</p><p>Another issue is to get more women to attend the conferences (that are left.) We have tried sending info to local women's colleges and even some personal contact with some women colleagues, and we were only partially successful at NCDevCon. We did have a decent mixture of attendees though. I would love more ideas on what might bring more females out to the conferences.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If I ever need to make code changes more than once to the same file - I try not to do this, but in some presos, its unavoidable - I will simply comment out the code I want to add prior to preso, and then just uncomment it. I am less likely to make typos commenting and uncommenting code than trying to write code on the fly.</p><p>Also, I used to open up all the 'preview' pages in a browser before hand, but recently, I have just started including links to the pages in the slide deck. This way, I have a prompt of when I should show example code (I would sometimes get lost as to waht demos to show)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only argument I'd have against your "comment" idea is that I tend to worry about it being distracting. So for example, if I'm demoing some ColdFusion feature, I'm not going to be anal about my HTML. Ie, I don't both with html, head, body, etc. I figure any line of code that is not necessary to demo feature X shouldn't be on screen, even if the result isn't "HTML Perfect" (if that makes sense). I try to do the same when I blog as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Makes perfect sense, and I typically will do the same, however, there have been presos I have given - like the 'Pimp Out Your Model' one I am dong for RIACon (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riacon.com%3A6MBSdiXC8HyVG29DOKJUE709oyA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.riacon.com">http://www.riacon.com</a>) where I am demoing a full app, and not just code snippets.</p></div>

Thread merge ;)</p><p>I think they are a great format for speaking.</p><p>To earlier points about finding something to talk about I have two thoughts;</p><p>a) one you don't have to be an expert on something to speak on it. Often its the basic or intro talks that help me get something. Especially if they come at it from a fresh perspective.</p><p>b) give a topic on your experience on something. This you can limit to just what you know. These can be useful for exposing others to a piece of a new technology.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jaana, I never thought about it before, but would more women attend conferences if there was a kids play thing or some sort of day care? It probably opens a bag of worms about liability, but we do want to encourage female attendance. I think I have even heard guys say they can't make it because they had to stay with the kids while their spouse was busy. Just an idea.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Roger, it would make a big difference if that was available. I have a great sitter in my end that most Saturday's my girls go with, but the day is not as long as it would be during a conference. The ability to bring my girls with me, leave them in capable hands during the conf. would make it a whole lot easier for me to participate.</p><p>Of course that idea will turn into a can of worms... different age groups, liability etc., but possibly something could be arranged with a daycare provider or such if there was enough interest in that.<br>Definitely worth thinking about :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, sorry to hijack your comments. We will move the discussion to the TACFUG list eventually.</p><p>Jaana, there is a lot to think about on the day care issue. It could work for both genders since people are so busy all the time. I know I have heard guys say that they couldn't make it due to having kid duty while their wife had a commitment.</p><p>If it would only be a couple of people, we might be able to find some responsible sitters around the area. There are a lot of college age women around who might like a weekend gig.</p><p>I'll bring this up with the NCDevCon team to see what they say. There is so much other stuff to do, but if it allows a few more women geeks to attend, it would be a good thing. I'll email you if I think of any questions. Feel free to email me directly if you have any suggestions and/or comments about this.</p></div>
