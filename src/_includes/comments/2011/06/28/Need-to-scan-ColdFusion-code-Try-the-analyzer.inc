		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm doing something similar.  I'm actually using the cfcompile.bat batch file to precompile an entire folder.  It will reveal files with errors, though not a lot of detail.  I have to go run the actual file (even if it's an MVC view file I would never access directly) to get the true compile error.</p><p>But it has been invaluable.</p><p>- Will B.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think this is a hugely underrated tool in the CF Admin. It has saved me tons of work every time I needed to upgrade a large site (or any site) to a newer version of ColdFusion.  I have found that there is a limit to how much code it can handle.  But that limit is far beyond most sites.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If this had some sort of API, we could use it as part of our build process - where this would really come in handy and we could enforce standards. But a good tip nonetheless.</p></div>
