		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use the server scope a lot to share what we'd normally think of as application scoped variables across the entire site.   This is because of previous choices about how our site's application.cfm files were set up.  So i use onServerStart() to initialize all the cached server scope data and use the method above when I need to reinitialize.</p><p>This is not the solution for everyone and i'd warn against using the server scope unless you have complete control over your ColdFusion server.</p></div>
