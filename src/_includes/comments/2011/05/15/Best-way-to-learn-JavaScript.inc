		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually *would* suggest studying OO JavaScript by Stefanov to get a good handle on things like closures, the prototype object, and constructors in JS. Crockford's JS:TGP is a great book, but I think it assumes a good amount of previous JS knowledge - it's rather succinct.</p><p>You can also get early access copies of Resig's Secret's of the JavaScript Ninja on Manning's website. O'Reilly's JavaScript Patterns book looks pretty good as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Adrian, what was your recommended solution to them mixing jQuery and native JavaScript?<br>My solution would be to change document.getElementById(x).value = ''; to $('#x').val('');<br>I would venture to guess that if you removed the use of jQuery in your example, it didn't mean that jQuery could be taken out of the program.<br>If the JavaScript part of a program is so small that you don't have any references to jQuery in it, then it's merely a proof-of-concept.<br>If it's of any size at all, you're using jQuery somewhere else in there.<br>And if it's a proof-of-concept, you should still be using jQuery anyway because that means that you're learning the language.<br>Perhaps using getElementById is too simplistic an example.  Anyone that has seen the minefield that events are (different commands depending on which browser) knows that a library HAD to have been written.</p><p>Wax on, Wax off?  jQuery is a Makita Electronic Polisher-Sander!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We've standardized on jQuery for the entire application. Until about 6 months ago, we only included the library when it was used on a page. I determined we were using it so often, there was no reason to not just load it all the time, so we did.</p><p>We told developers that ***if*** they knew how to do something with jQuery, they should. We have a LOT of old school document.formName.fieldName.value() going on and even worse, window.document . . .</p><p>In the case above, yes, all they needed to do was jQuery('#foo').val('');, but they didn't know that. They didn't know val(), they knew how to set a field value using the getElementById() method. They "just wanted to use jQuery" and there you go.</p><p>@Doug - I wouldn't worry about jQuery. Microsoft has included it as part of the .NET framework and Adobe is invested in it as well. Have you seen the integration with DreamWeaver? It's amazing.</p><p>Ray, correct me if I'm wrong, but at the recent jQuery Conference, they stated that ~44% of all sites are using jQuery. If you intend to be in web development right now, I think learning JavaScript first and jQuery second would greatly benefit anyone.</p></div>
