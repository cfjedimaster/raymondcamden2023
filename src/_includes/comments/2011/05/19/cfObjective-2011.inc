		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was wondering if you knew if any of the talks would be posted online anywhere?  I looked at the official site and didn't see anything.  Heck, just the presentation material could be beneficial to review.  I'd love to see the OAUTH presentation as that topic has always been a bit weird to me as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only thing that I would have liked to have seen would have been Adobe at the conference (?), and recordings of the sessions. Lots of good information, only one me. The guy that presented on ColdFusion extensions did a really good job as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the kind words Ray; it means a lot considering I have gotten so much out of your session (You're session on Model-Glue several years ago was what caused it to "click" for me)</p><p>My presentation files are located here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jeffgladnick.com%2Fcfobj%2F%3AUzNrL0Zi6SlYIOY-d8ncW0_FeEA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.jeffgladnick.com/cfobj/">http://www.jeffgladnick.com...</a> for anyone who wants em.</p></div>
