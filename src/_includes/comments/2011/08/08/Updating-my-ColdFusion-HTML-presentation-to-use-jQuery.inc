		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>The html5slides has layout classes to compensate for various monitor screen aspects:  "Change the outermost section class layout-regular to layout-faux-widescreen or layout-widescreen."  Of course, an auto-detect and adjustment routine would be a nice touch...</p><p>I see some near-future uses for a couple of these preso plugins, thanks for the post!</p><p>-Mark</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mark, I didn't mean to imply that was a bug. In fact, I am pretty sure it is an intentional design choice. It's just one I don't like. I could be reading your wrong of course. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No I was just trying to say that I noticed the portion of the next slide disappeared as I pulled the right edge of the browser window in (so that it was more of a 4:3 aspect) so I assumed the different layout classes were meant for specific monitors/audiences... &lt;grin&gt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, this is really good.  I just thought of an application I can use this for.  Rather than asking my students to put together a PowerPoint file, I can get them to upload their pictures one at a time and they can do their presentation from this.  That way, it's all in my system and I can grade on each individual slide.</p></div>
