		<div class="comment_text"><p>Coolio.  This answers the question I've been looking at over here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.adobe.com%2Fmessage%2F3875518%3AGK4i6twc00njG7-XtYRB4W2sBig&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.adobe.com/message/3875518">http://forums.adobe.com/mes...</a>.</p><p>It'd be good if this made its way into the docs! (the *CF* docs, that is).</p><p>I also think it would be good to have this as an (optional) setting on CFCOLLECTION &amp; the UI in CF Admin, rather than hacking config files.  This *is* CF we're talking about after all!</p><p>I should perhaps raise an issue in the bug tracker...</p><p>-- <br>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To piggyback on Adam's comment. One can only hope that with the removal of Verity, that a new Admin area will be built to address this for Solr.  Ray, any chance you can ping one of your co-workers to see if we need to add this as a feature request?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Adam/Steve: I think with all the options you can do in Solr, it would be difficult to create a web based admin to handle them all. That being said, it's not out of the realm of possibility to add _more_ stuff for some settings, like this one. Steve - I'd let Adam file the ER, let him then post the URL here, then you (and others) can vote on it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Further to my last comment what a pain. CF7 and CF8 and CF9 servers.</p><p>Not easy to get my Porsche driving boss to upgrade every licence (obviously) just the coding changes are not worth it for a site that works fine. But...</p><p>When "fixing" a site that someone else made and have it singing like a songbird and then find it breaks cos the server is CF8 or 7 and not 9 is kinda crushing. And makes you feel like an idiot.</p><p>I will give my employer credit in that they, like me, have been using ColdFusion since at least 1995 when I started working there. And they still are. Hence the 7, 8 and 9. Probably a few 5 and 6s they haven't told me about yet.</p><p>Why did they switch to Cold Fusion (as it was known back then)? ASP (as it was also known back then) "just broke". And my boss, hasn't changed a bit in that regard, needed it fixed fast.</p><p>Largest ISP in a capital city of a major nation. Gotta have a dynamic web site that works.</p><p>Within a working day (total novice to even ASP) I converted the ASP site to CF and neither of us have looked back since. CF was a floppy or quick download back then and it still amazes me how much better as a platform it has become.</p><p>Sixteen years later I still love ColdFusion!</p><p>Cheers!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for this fix.<br>I have a document section on our work site where the user can create a category to upload documents to.  When they do this, it creates a new collection for that category.  I won't know the user did this, and they won't have access to the server.<br>I read in your instructions that I can edit each individual collection, is there a way to make an edit sitewide?<br>I'm using the Solr built in to CF9.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div>
