		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I downloaded it just to give it a shot and checked out some of the samples they had online and while it seems cool I found the sites to load kind of slow, like they were not fully optimized for web? Also the interface seemed kind of clunky, powerful yes but just felt like I said clunky. Maybe they will make it better once its golden.</p><p>Thanks for the heads up though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm with Jaana... do both design and coding. It looks to be VERY interesting for me in that sense.</p><p>HTML snippets (i.e. CF built widgets) might be enough, but I could imagine this as also/or being a full-fledged front end to design CF based and data driven apps... mmmmmm! Hope Adobe does too!</p><p>Will be following it's progress very intently!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Netobjects Fusion was a horrible product! I stopped using it in early 2000. I'm sure it's changed a lot since then.</p><p>Muse has the big benefit of it being an Adobe product and most likely it will integrate with PhotoShop, Fireworks and/or Illustrator and other Adobe products.</p></div>
