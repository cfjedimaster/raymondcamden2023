		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started My love affair with coldfusion about a year ago when I started working for a company that only uses CF due to the ease of use and easy database integration. I had not done any real web development before. Mostly I had done programming in VB, Java and C++ you know the basics you get taught at university level. I left uni to work for my current employer and what I have learned in the last year has far surpassed everything I have learned in three years at uni.</p><p>in CF we trust</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, if you get a chance and are willing to do so, could you elaborate a little more?  How did you get from tinkering around with CF 3 to writing the bibles on CF Development (the CFWACK books) to arguably being the one of the top authorities on ColdFusion development?  I'm always reading books on athletes and businessmen and women and how they got to where they are, but unfortunately there's a lack of information like that about the top people in my own field.  Thanks!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was a FoxPro developer in a previous life. Back in mid-1995 I was hired to work for the Energy Information Administration branch of the Department of Energy to build an ad hoc report writer that would talk to Oracle backends. My customer became disillusioned with the project and ask me to come up with something that would 'make him famous'. I suggested we build an ad hoc reporting system using web technologies. He gave the green light and I was given 2 weeks to build something.  So I built the system using FoxPro and the first Windows web server, O'Reilly's WebSite Pro (anybody else remember that?).  It worked well, but management was concerned (rightfully so) about maintaining the app should I get hit by a beer truck crossing the street. So they asked me to look at other technologies that would be easier to maintain. I had looked at version 1 or 1.5 of CF before, but the language wasn't rich enough at the time. I went back and looked at 2.0, and decided it was perfect for what we wanted. So we built the first ad hoc reporting tool using CF 2 talking to an Access database with 1.2 million records in it (I know, I know... yuck).  It worked well and was actually featured on a CNN report back in 1997.  Still using CF as my main tool after all these years.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got my start in ColdFusion about 9 years ago ... coming out of college in 1991 with a CS degree, I ended up at a company that was just doing work on mainframes (third-party stuff, some shell scripting). Eventually we moved to VBA for small-scale projects, but projects grew to the point where we needed a bigger platform. We'd done a single VB project (deployment and maintenance were painful) but nothing else online.</p><p>Another group in the company found CF and began working with it, deploying an application that could handle much larger data sets than our VBA apps could use. I saw the way things were heading and jumped to the web development group. I had some HTML experience, and between that and my CS background, CF (I think it was MX at the time) was easy to pick up.</p><p>I've poked around with other languages, but I always come back to ColdFusion. I'm fortunate enough to be working in 9 right now, and I hope to be able to work with some of the cool new features in 10 when it's released.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I also dropped EE.  Found myself learning Business and Applied Economics.  THEN I picked up CF because it was the platform my employer used.  We had no budget for development so I was given a MS Access datasource and production web space.  I got a gently used copy of CF 5 WACK and was on my way.  Knowing *nothing* about relational design at the time, it was a matter of days before my first-ever CF app brought down the server.  I had a single table that had 58 columns.  I guess Access can't handle this, so it was locking up the datasource and any other app on the server was waiting for it to be finished.  Luckily, a sysadmin was there and I got a crash course in relational design on the spot!  Ah, memories :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>heh, I managed to start with cold fusion earlier than that - I don't remember exactly but it was at least a 2.something version.  (just checked the version history, probably 2.0, right before 3.0 came out). Similar though, company was coding websites in C++, was going downhill. I was the only guy left coding and wasn't good with C++, 2 weeks later the entire companies website was re-written in CF. Never looked back. People make fun of me sometimes for it, but they don't realize how easy/powerful it is.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got started in 2001 when I began my career with the US Courts in the in Texas. I had been brought on board to help move the district I was working in from a legacy system to a newer system for case management.</p><p>during that process we determined that there was a need for a QC system to help keep track of and correct data entered. We decided to go with Coldfusion. I have a background programming in C on QNX systems as well as Unix/Linux so it was a fairly speedy transition for me to coldfsuion.</p><p>I have moved to a different aspect of working with the courts and written many apps. reports. electronic forms, etc ... since and have definitely enjoyed the journey. I hope and look forward to the future of coldfusion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@CD: I got really turned on by custom tags. Not sure why - but I did. I shared quite a few of them, and that got the attention of others. I also started participating in cf-talk, which was a lot more active back then. I was asked to speak at the first CF conference (in Ft. Collins) and it just kinda snowballed from there. I found I really enjoyed talking about CF - just about as much as I did writing it.</p></div>

To hire another PHP programmer or do that project myself.</p><p>I took this as a challenge and completed that project in three months using CF8 and mySql. I loved simplicity of Coldfusion and now Coldfusion is part of of my everyday's work.</p><p>I had no background of programming. Now my designation in my office is Senior Application Architect. I would like to thank you Ray for your write ups which inspired me to take that challenge. Thank You</p></div>
