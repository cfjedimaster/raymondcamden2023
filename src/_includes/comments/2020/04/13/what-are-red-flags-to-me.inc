		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can only recall one or two companies getting "Timed Trial" right and I couldn't even tell you who they were now. The system counted how many days total that the program was used, not X days from the first time you use it. That allowed me to test a "30 day trial" over a few months as things inevitably came up.</p></div>
