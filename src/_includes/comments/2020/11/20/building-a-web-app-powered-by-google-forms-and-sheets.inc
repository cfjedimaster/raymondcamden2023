		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is cool Raymond!</p><p>One note. I think you need to enable link sharing in order for the csv link to work without requiring a login. (see image below) <a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c631584776fddfa7fffcf2cc4266a4c136d75787a6a1587a017a1773d6df613d.png" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c631584776fddfa7fffcf2cc4266a4c136d75787a6a1587a017a1773d6df613d.png">https://uploads.disquscdn.c...</a></p><p>Also, while Google Forms is great, they definitely look like Google Forms. If you want to keep your form on-brand you can create your own HTML form and then connect it to Google Sheets with Formspree. (see <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformspree.io%2Fblog%2Fhtml-contact-form%2F%3AyfjffHNZhuN1s30WpE_K5HcrXOs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://formspree.io/blog/html-contact-form/">https://formspree.io/blog/h...</a> ) You can set up a similar approval flow by adding an "approved" column to the sheet that Formspree generates.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For the first thing - it isn't a share option, but a "publish to the web" thing. It's slightly different UI but that's how you get the URL. I don't think it's the share option.</p><p>For the second thing - yep - I use Formspree for my comment form. :) Wufoo makes really pretty forms too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok. Weird. When I enabled "publish to the Web" I still needed to login after clicking the generated CSV link. Only after I enabled publish <i>and</i> link sharing would the CSV download without a login prompt. Presumably this would also affect Papa Parse. Just sharing in case anyone else runs into this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Weird. So I also made a public accessible link. That didn't seem to work ... at first ... I double checked and it did work. Going to edit the text here a bit.</p></div>
