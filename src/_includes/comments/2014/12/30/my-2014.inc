		<div class="comment_text"><p>Happy New Year (a little early), Ray! I was saddened to read your Career section. You are great at teaching and sharing knowledge (as this blog demonstrates), and it sucks that those skills are just being used "on the side" instead of day-to-day at your job. Hopefully things will turn around in a good way in 2015.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chris - a question about your comment. You certainly do not have to answer this, but I was curious. You mentioned you have known me about several years, but only recently went to my blog. Any reason for that? You can be honest - so like - if you didn't have any reason too that is totally fine. Just curious. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've not been much of a blogger nor a blog follower until recently, but I've been a lurking part of the CFML community for years. I'm still not much of a blogger. I've also just discovered podcasts, not that I didn't know they existed,  but I've only just discovered how freak'n information rich and awesome they are. It's been a year of discovery for me. I'm slowly weaving myself into the fabric of our community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for sharing. I don't do podcasts myself. I work at home and find that if I listen to a podcast while working, I really don't "listen" at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I'm the same. I generally listen on my way to/from work or whenever I'm in my car alone. I've recently concluded a contract, so am back on the market which means I'll have less time for podcasts. That's a bummer, but I'm excited too because I plan to use my free time learning all I can about building hybrid apps in an offline-first way. Should be fun!</p></div>
