		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's certainly not as big or large as other programming communities, but I can't say I've had any real complaints about the people in it. Quite positive actually. Most of if any complaints I have are by-products of the size, not individuals. I'd love for more open source projects, tools, etc. Yes, I should be doing something myself to contribute. But to be honest, CF is my day job and I play with other stuff in my free time. OS contributors are the extreme minority of any community, but more people means a bigger minority. That said, I've really tried to keep better tabs on blogs, Twitter, and CF related Google Groups to comment and contribute where I can. I've significantly upped my Twitter game because it seems like that's where a lot of the interactions happen.</p><p>That said I think the stuff we do have is pretty great and has been becoming more aware aware of other technologies and tools out there to shape and influence them rather than exist in a total vacuum as CF and consequently CF devs have been in for a long time. Those reasons could be explored in a whole 'nother blog post I'd imagine. I think we all know CF has some catching up to do.</p><p>I feel like I'm in a bit of a minority in the CF community. I really began CF programming in 2008 as an developer intern in my last college semester. I've been doing CF (and the rest of the web stack) full-time ever since. So I feel like it's put me in a spot where I'm not stuck doing things the "old way" because that's simply the way I/"the company" always done it or something. Rather, wanting to apply modern, widely accepted and preached, practices heard in other software development circles to CF and integrate them with newer tools and technology. It helps I've worked for companies that explore other types of newer technology. At the end of the day, it's just a tool and CF is the sharpest one in my shed. So, I owe a big thanks to you, Ray, and many others for helping me along the early parts of my career, not just how to use this particular tool, but software development on the whole.</p><p>Sure, there's plenty complaining about the product (I agree with most of it anyway, but I've moved on to 100% Railo but that still means I need to be cognizant of what Adobe is doing). But the community, the actual people? All good experiences although I haven't met many personally outside my immediate network of co-workers from the last few years. Maybe the rest of you are all old, crotchety, and mean ;)</p></div>

Put some tinsel on your Tie Fighter or something. ;-) I agree with your comments, the CF community might be small but it's full of nice, helpful people in 95% of my experiences. Community = good. Product = needs refocusing and for Adobe to listen to developers more. Decorations = you need some.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been programming in ColdFusion since 1998. I would not be where I am in my life without ColdFusion. For the longest time people have said, "ColdFusion will die out." However, 'till this day ColdFusion is still live and stronger than ever. I see progresses like Railo, ColdBox, and Mura which lets me know the movement is still continuing. Although at times I wonder when will the run end but I'll worry about that when it actually happens. For now I will continue to enjoy programming in ColdFusion.</p><p>Sorry to hear that you heard such negativity about the ColdFusion community. Personally many of the "good" people I have met is from the ColdFusion community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've heard negative things said about ColdFusion by folks outside the community, but the CF community seems to be mostly supportive. The negative stuff is due to it being a commercial product rather than open source mostly.</p><p>In my experience, most of the tech communities I have had experience in have been very positive, both locally and on-line. You do get the trolls at times. Of course, we should make vendors accountable when they make mistakes, but most people are honest souls.</p><p>I have made a lot of good friends with TACFUG and through NCDevCon. The on-line community can be challenging at times (especially CF-Talk), but nice people do help people there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started doing Coldfusion when I joined the original company Allaire.  I loved the product and went full bore into using it for my websites.  It was well ahead of its time and easier to use than PHP.  I loved the database connection tags and the custom tag library you could write.  Sure it had its products that were questsionable, remember Spectra!  I had always found that the User groups and community in genereal were very friendly.  I remember the Toronto UG was especially nice giving that I was lecturing to them with 102 fever.  But all in all CFML earned its place in the history of the web and deserves to continue on.  I hope I will always come across sites that still use it like <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fautobytel.com%3A7ekPybPP77Eb-lPO9dCww56UpyE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="autobytel.com">autobytel.com</a> and many others that still believe in the language.  Thanks to the brothers Allaire for coming up with such a great language.  Too bad they sold it to Macromedia who eventually choked it out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, maybe I read into it, but there was a reason you said it (you didn't have to).  It is an issue that you can always find on the web about ColdFusion.  Came off a little like a eulogy to ColdFusion (to me).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ugh. I was willing to blame hefterr for perhaps not being an English speaker, but I know better with you Emmet. -sigh-</p><p>To be clear: I work at Adobe, but I am a peon. I have no knowledge of Adobe killing ColdFusion. My comment about not knowing how long it will last applies to *every* technology out there. It was generic, nothing more.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, I was a bit frustrated and meant no offense. I thought I was being clear, but when you said, "there was a reason you said it", I thought it was a bit pushy. Not sure how many different ways I can say it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great video Ray, totally agree! Now its time for a follow up video rallying the troops to get involved and push towards the future of cfml, not a dystopian one but one of renaissance. To do this we need people to blog, tweet, create open source, post on hn, etc. If everyone in the cfml community did just one of these things it would go along way in changing popular opinion and helping people to take another look and reconsider. Look at the rise of RoR, great marketing campaign, together we can do that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep. The community def needs to buy-in a bit more.</p><p>I feel guilty I don't submit pull reqs to any OS projects, but I *do* try to feed the various bug trackers as much as I can. And the blog (although that might fall under the "dystopian" view you mention ;-). And I do try to "keep the discussion going".</p><p>What about you, Tim? Money where your mouth is mate... blog?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally I think the CF community as a whole is pretty awesome... I don't use CF as much anymore but CF was my gateway into development so Im thankful that I had the opportunity to grow and learn from working with it. I learned a lot just from studying your code samples and BlogCFC, LightHouse App, CFAggregator, etc...</p><p>Thanks for all your patience and tolerance over the years for my relying on you for CF info... </p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Haha, yes, I had been challenged by various voices in the cfml community years ago to get involved. Now I'm not much of a blogger but since then I've contributed to various projects like CFWheels, and released Wheelie CMS. My projects can be seen at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftimsayshey%3AsCFdzvO6hOXE5egH_-do2KbJlnE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://github.com/timsayshey">http://github.com/timsayshey</a> -- I think it can all be overwhelming that's why I just want to encourage everyone in the community to do just one thing. Go comment about cfml on a Hacker news story, tweet about the new bitnami project, create a cfml github project, contribute, just one thing. If we all did just one thing, that would be huge.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Def. I was not questioning your creds, btw: just following up your own comment.</p><p>Being the complete CF celebrity like Ray is difficult (author, blogger, speaker, coder). But just tweeting away, raising or answering questions on stack overflow, posting to forums, doing the odd commit to a github repo... each individually is a) rewarding; b) easy; c) accessible to everyone.</p><p>I'm formulating a blog post on it.</p></div>
