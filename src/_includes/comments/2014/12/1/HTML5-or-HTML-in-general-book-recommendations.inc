		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've found HTML5 &amp; CSS3 for the Real World by Alexis Goldstein, Louis Lazaris, and Estelle Weyl and published by SitePoint to be really good. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sitepoint.com%2Fstore%2Fhtml5-css3-for-the-real-world%2F%3AG_da3sN7iMvn-aqwAar5mMC0rnU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.sitepoint.com/store/html5-css3-for-the-real-world/">http://www.sitepoint.com/st...</a></p><p>Another one which is good, but not exclusively HTML5 is Pro HTML5 Accessibility by Joshue O'Conner <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPro-HTML5-Accessibility-Joshue-Connor%2Fdp%2F1430241942%3ApGwKLvz4MLXc8oxGBoD_T5G4SPQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-HTML5-Accessibility-Joshue-Connor/dp/1430241942">http://www.amazon.com/Pro-H...</a></p><p>Reason I recommend this one is that since I do a lot of government work which is mandated to be accessible, this book made it much easier to work with HTML 5 and accessibility, as can be seen on this one project I worked on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.cms.gov%2Fresources%2Fframework%2F3.0%2FPages%2F%3AifATQelat6VqCYTBZltIovMEwoo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://assets.cms.gov/resources/framework/3.0/Pages/">http://assets.cms.gov/resou...</a></p></div>
