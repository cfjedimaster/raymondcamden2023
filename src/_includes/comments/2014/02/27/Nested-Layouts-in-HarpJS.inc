		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's a good thing!</p><p>As the name suggests, XSLT is a powerful templating language, but has some drawbacks, of which the likes of jade,ejs,haml etc address.</p><p>By separating partials into templates and applying different modes, you can build quite a  powerful, modular and reusable system - as long as one can conceptually keep up with it. ut this was also part of XSLT's problem (different concepts).</p><p>As an example, have a look at some code I wrote a while back which transformed the shape of an XML document into a different structure. In particular, the way modes are applied - <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FDemwunz%2F4469400%23file-master-xslt%3AhCFHIdoOe85d3kerdoEzuj9hOs0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://gist.github.com/Demwunz/4469400#file-master-xslt">https://gist.github.com/Dem...</a></p><p>It will be interesting to see how HarpJS progresses with more complex structures, I think there is a lesson to be learnt from XSLT. Either way, I'm enjoying Harp immensely so far, and your own experience with it too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool example there, and glad you are liking the demos so far. Speaking of templating, in theory, Harp will soon support Handlebars and I'm *really* looking forward to that.</p></div>
