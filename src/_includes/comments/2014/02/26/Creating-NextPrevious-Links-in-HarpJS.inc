		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,<br>Thank you for writing this! I am new to HarpJs and this really helped me out (like all your other blog posts).</p><p>I just have a question, how would I be able to paginate my main articles page? So I can show say 5 blog posts per page and with a simple "next" and "previous" link to show 5 more blog posts? I am moving away from WP and this is something I would love to implement but now show how?! :-/ at the moment I just list all of my blog posts and it looks wrong.</p><p>Keep up the superb work Raymond!<br>Best regards,<br>Debbie</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunately, this is something that HarpJS does *not* provide out of the box. Harp requires a physical page for each URL, so if you wanted /page2.html, /page3.html, etc for your history, you would need to physically make those. Now -at that point it is trivial to write the logic to show the right page, but you still need physical files.</p><p>Jekyll does this out of the box and handles it well. (By the way, I don't mean that to say Harp is horrible and you should never use it, just that this is one place where it fails compared to other products.)</p></div>
