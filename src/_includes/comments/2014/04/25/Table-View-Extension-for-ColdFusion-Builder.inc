		<div class="comment_text"><p>Got the answer from Ray on twitter, need to make sure I use the @raymondcamden twitter account, but wanted to post my question here to help others out.<br>So this seems like a cool extension so wanted to know will this work for Bulider 2.1? I figured it would, but since i have not looked into what might have been updated for builder 3, not sure if any of the extension parts of builder may have been updated and only work for 3.0. <br>Ray says it is backwards compatible to 2.1...hope this helps others. Now off to try it, thanks Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In fact, I think that is actually my bug, Ray!  Good to know Adobe's CF dev team is still committed to quality and listening to its users (/sarcasm).  Seriously what a joke.  At least hide the menu item if it's broken - it doesn't take that much effort.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I considered it. But it seems (imo!) that the primary use for this is to get a "feel" for the data, not for searching or seeing *all* the data. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree. I have some large data sets and sometimes 200 is too much.  I actually wanted a way to go to 1-200 (current) and not to use it to dump all records or search records.  I will manually change it to 10 or 20.  Thank you again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Side question: I also used the broken RDS thing to do some ad hoq queries at times. You can do that now if you right click in a cfquery block - this fires up a new SQL view that works fine - but I don't always *have* a cfquery block. Also - I don't see myself doing much cfquery blocks now that writing queries in cfscript is so much easier. I may add a new option to let you write your own sql. Useful?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First, thank you for the tip on right clicking on the query block.  Personally, I plan to move towards script version as well and would find this feature very useful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just tested. If you right click in queryExecute and launch the sql editor, it does NOT pick up the current SQL.</p></div>
