		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Raymond,<br>This looks great and thanks for sharing all this great info.</p><p>I am a designer and this looks like a great way to share my design with my developers...</p><p>*2 Questions*<br>*1.* Is it possible to figure out relative and proportionate scaling / spacing? I see that it tells you distance between 2 objects (which is great) but more often than not I have a really hard time communicating to my developers that I want say a "slideshow" to maintain its *PROPORTIONS &amp;  screen PERCENTAGE..*. Is that possible with Parfait and if not do you know of an easy way to figure that out and communicate / translate that from design - dev.</p><p>*2. SVG's -* I see there is an option for SVG output to assets... do those have to be smart objects or will it convert bitmap to svg as well?</p></div>
