		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't say that I like this news. I realize you're not a ColdFusion evangelist at Adobe per se but it sends a bad message to the ColdFusion developer community. "If Ray doesn't run CF anymore, why should I?" I don't know if I'd care as much except that you wrote BlogCFC, which is still the de facto standard for blogs in ColdFusion and as a matter of principle, if I were in your shoes, I'd run BlogCFC until CF no longer existed. I realize that you shouldn't be obligated to stay on CF if it doesn't suit your site anymore, and I'm not in your shoes, but I'm just saying. That's just me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What you said earlier was: "Any ColdFusion demos would fail, but I typically post my code in downloadable format as well." That suggested you were abandoning ColdFusion on the server. Did I misunderstand?</p><p>As far as what I said earlier, I still feel the same way largely because of BlogCFC. I can't imagine many people would use it anymore if its author isn't. It seems a more reasonable thing to try to track down the issue before giving up entirely.</p><p>Also, hypothetically, let's say that you did stop using BlogCFC on here: Wouldn't links to your blog entries go 404 as a result? I would think that would do more harm to your traffic than some site instability. You'd be better off keeping the blog online that way for existing blog entries and figure out some other alternative for new blog entries if you're going to go ahead with it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is it a Windows box with CF10 and Apache? There seems to be a nasty connector bug in CF10's mod_jk that basically crashes Apache when it can't reuse connections, no amount of running seems to fix it as it looks like a memory leak. I've seen it happen on 2 Windows + Apache servers, only problem is I can't replicate it in a non-production environment so it's very hard to provide a test case for. (And yes, the connectors were removed and rerun after installing updates). But if that's not your environment then just ignore me :)</p><p>P.S. The Blog CFC comments to Disqus migration is very easy, I moved mine about 6 months ago. Let me know if you need some code :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Im just a bit worried the way Adobe is taking CF.  I love the pricing structure of the Adobe CC.  But when you can't open CFM or CFC files in Dreamweaver it starts making you wonder.  Yes of course they want you to purchase an extra $300 product (CF Builder) to natively edit their several thousand dollar web app.  Or take the time and screw around with the preferences in DW to fix this.  It makes you wonder..me and several other I know at least.<br>And yes I know this is just a *bit* off topic here but it's been bugging me all day.</p><p>...ok, bitching mode over...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thats the stripped down version right?  I forgot about that part so thanks for the reminder.  But I still find it a bit funky that Adobe's primary IDE doesn't work natively with out of the digital box with Adobe's only web application server.<br>I recently started working for an employer who has been around for decades and has been using CF since version 4 or 5.  They are now looking to get off of CF and moving to PHP or .net because of the lack of CF developers out there.  I've actually heard this from a couple of  companies in one form or another during my recent job search in the past 3 months.  It just makes a CF developer wonder what I should start looking at next.  I have some PHP experience but .net pays quite a bit more.</p><p>I am curious as to peoples thought on the future of CF.  I know you work for Adobe but you always seem to speak your mind.  I would really like to hear other peoples thoughts on this matter.  Or maybe this might be better for a separate blog entry.<br>Thanks Ray</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Aeros: It is missing a few features, but I wouldn't call it stripped down.</p><p>To me - at the end of the day - DW has it's place - and CFB has it's place. I don't necessarily see any benefit in Adobe putting effort into making DW better for CF devs when there is already effort in another editor specifically tuned to CF. That's my opinion, not company policy.</p><p>As for the future of CF - we've got a public beta of the next version already out there. That's commitment at least for the immediate future I'd say. (And the new CFB is pretty nice I think.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I understand your thought here.  Our company just has a bunch of adobe CC licenses which doesnt have CFB.  But with some workaround you can get DW to work.  They just dont want to have to pay another $300 for another editor..thats all.<br>Ill take a look at the new CF.  I used to do that all the time when I wrote books for the earlier versions of CF.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, it sounds like the mod_jk connector bug then, perhaps you could check the connector logs to confirm? It might be something that the CF engineering team should see for themselves. I'm not sure how many other people have run into this issue, but when it happens it seems like the only solution is to use IIS instead of Apache... Have you got time to work through the issue fully and/or get the engineering team involved, because I think this is something that may need a connector hotfix :S</p></div>
