		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the review, Ray. I've been learning iOS and objective C (and Xcode) for the past few weeks as well.  I really wish I had the opportunity to do it the way you did!  Like you said, objective C is a really different critter and it would be nice to have a human to ask questions to in person. I've been doing "The Complete iOS 7 Course - Learn by Building 14 Apps" on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fudemy.com%3AHT_CBOasAqXUPuddv6PPtNVGBz8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="udemy.com">udemy.com</a>. There's no balloon bending, but the course is excellent and might be a great alternative for folks who can't afford BNR or spare the week.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great post, you can help with phonegap plugins now.</p><p>I liked the BNR iOS programming book a lot, I've read it almost three times, first the spanish translation of the 1st edition, then started the second edition, and just before finishing it the third edition came out and started reading it instead of the second. I should read the 4th too.</p><p>I considered going to the BNR camp in Netherland, but it was too expensive to me ( even if it worth the money, but it's like 2 months of my salary), so I went to a course in Spain by one of the BNR teachers instead, it was 20 hours, middle level and like 600$ (no travel, hotel or meals included). It was good too and more affordable for me, but I though the middle level was going to be more advanced as they asked a lot about my exprecience and even proposed me to wait to the next session in 3-4 months.</p><p>The best part was, as you said, when the teacher show you xcode tips and useful tools you won't learn from the books</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I spent a LOT of time in Xcode teaching myself Objective-C a couple years ago... and I was just doing OS X development. It's definitely overwhelming, not just because Xcode is huge with tons of features and Obj-C was a new language but because of the HUGE variety of APIs provided by Apple.</p><p>I can only imagine that with iOS the same is true in terms of the depth of features and canned APIs provided by Apples frameworks and libraries. The barriers to entry are high because there's so much already there that you need to get familiar with.</p><p>This class sounds like an awesome opportunity to skip ahead and start being productive rather than slogging through it on your own like I did. You can only get aomfar on your own. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sounds like a great learning experience and one that I would enjoy. I did some C programming in the past for instrument interfacing, but I assume this is different. <br>For me, I don't need an excuse or much of a reason to jump on a training event. It always sounds expensive, but having that skill would be amazing for a younger person these days. The need for iOS devs is fairly high from what I hear and probably would be worth $5k as an investment.<br>It is awesome that you get it paid for since everything I do with training comes out of my pocket.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>Is Xamarin the ColdFusion of mobile development? I was where you were and feel this great big barrier of Android development hanging over my shoulders. Why not just use C# and write fewer lines of code while learning a single language and framework?</p><p>I'm honestly looking for an argument against using Xamarin, but I can't find it. Cost is an obvious answer, but we already overpay for ColdFusion, why not Xamarin?</p><p>In addition, as an added benefit for ColdFusion developers (I know that this is no longer a ColdFusion blog), we would get to learn C# which at least gets us cross training for more job opportunities with similar salary, unlike, say, Ruby or PHP which tend to pay 20% or so less.</p><p>J</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi jcesarmobile,</p><p>Isn't that the same thing we argue for with ColdFusion? Use native UI instead of the UI tags stuffed into ColdFusion? Just because you have to use HTML/CSS/JS for UI, doesn't mean you should stop using ColdFusion and switch back to pure Java.</p><p>That being said, I get the impression that you do your UI with Xamarin, but you have to do it specifically per platform. It's not that you fire up XCode and do your storyboard. It's just that you have separate UI sources per platform created in C# with Xamarin.</p><p>J</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Justin: I can't necessarily talk about Xamarin as I haven't used it - but I think I get the gist of your question. I *do* use the heck out of PhoneGap/Cordova, and you may want to know my opinion about which I think is more appropriate, better, etc.</p><p>Personally, my opinion on this hasn't changed. What I've said before when presenting on PG is that it is *a* solution for mobile apps, not *the* solution. Of course native dev is going to be more powerful! But it isn't necessarily always the best solution to get you to your end result. Web standards are something a lot more of us have exposure to, so being able to use that to build mobile apps I think is incredibly cool.</p><p>Personally, it makes me really happy that we have options. More opportunities for people to create are a good thing. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I'm glad you were able to go to BNR and enjoyed it as much as you did. Myself and a co-worker attended their HTML5 course last year, taught by the amazing Chris Aquino. It was a great class. One of the things I loved about the BNR experience was the fact that you didn't just attend class, you also ate meals with your fellow students and the instructors, did extracurricular activities with them as well, and spent more time with them at post-class lab time until around midnight. My class had some great white board programming jam sessions and programming philosophy discussions after hours too. My point for those that haven't attended BNR is that the courses are just 9-to-5 training sessions. You're essentially spending the entire day with your fellow students and the instructors. When you break down the time you actually can spend with the instructors by hour, I think the price of the classes looks like an even better deal. BNR is now the standard that all other training courses are held to in my book.</p><p>I'm hoping that I get to go back this year for the Beginning iOS course. Everyone I've read about or talked to that's taken the course has given it rave reviews.</p><p>I will warn others that if you go to one of the courses in the summer, keep in mind you will be SOUTH of Atlanta. It will be hot. It will be humid. The class room will be comfortable, but when you walk around outside in the beautiful nature, bring light, comfortable clothes, and definitely bring insect repellant.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would say that if you have no programming experience, it may be difficult. For example, basic ideas of how to handle conditions, looping, etc. ObjectiveC is *very* different, and if you have *no* code experience, than it may be a bit too much. You said you dipped your toes in C#, so I think you may be ok. I'd maybe suggest picking up the course book. The ObjectiveC one, not iOS, and go through a few chapters to see if it seems ok to you. You will end up with a second copy when you go, but that isn't so bad imo. If you use the link in my article I get like 2 bucks. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice review, Raymond. I'm going to that very class in October. I'm just finishing the iOS Programming book and before that their Objective-C book. I will assume they teach pretty-much straight from the books? Luckily I've remembered to take notes and jot down questions as I go so I can ask about the issues I had.</p><p>One thing I'd like to ask is that several later chapters in the iOS book seemed rushed. Kind of like, "Here's how to do all this. Now let's move on." Do they spend more time explaining the guts or reasoning behind why code does what it does, or do they leave it up to us to explore after class? I'm one of those guys that needs to know exactly what each line of code does. I hate getting things to work, then when I'm asked what the code does, I have to say, "I have no clue. I copied and pasted it."</p><p>Thanks again for the good review. I'm really looking forward to my turn at camp!</p></div>

Felt like the best option - and frankly - after the first few days it was nice to slow down a bit and make some choices about what to cover.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, first off, I wasn't at IBM at the time. I was very up front about the costs, and I gave my honest opinion describing why I thought it was worth that cost and in my opinion, that would apply to people paying it themselves or trying to get their employer to pay for it. If the review means nothing to you because Adobe paid for it, then I think you are missing out. I truly think BNR training is a great product.</p></div>
