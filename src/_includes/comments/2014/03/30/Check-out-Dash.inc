		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love Dash! I've been using it for over a year now. It's really nice having docs for angular, ember, coldfusion, and ruby all with in single panel. The nagging isn't too bad, but it does get annoying when you switch between a lot of docsets. Other than that I have been incredibly pleased with how it works. They keep adding docsets and integrations in the last year docset coverage has doubled and integrations have been included for a lot of major editors. Also the docsets are updated very frequently. Well worth the 20 bucks to purchase or just deal with the nagging.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice app! There seems to be also an open source alternative for Windows/Linux called Zeal (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzealdocs.org%2F%29%3AbZTKhcJ0G2KT1JlAMjY3vNs3qpk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://zealdocs.org/)">http://zealdocs.org/)</a> It is using the Dash documentation sets. <br>I am new to the ColdFusion world and this is just the tool I was missing. Thanks!</p></div>
