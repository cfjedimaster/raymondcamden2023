		<div class="comment_text"><p>Xcode, CocoaPods, and other tools prefer (if not demand) command-line friendly pathnames. No spaces, and no odd-ball characters other than _ or -.</p><p>Build a project once with a folder name of T&amp;T and got all sorts of errors that I tracked down to a failed CocoaPods command line build.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It always surprises me that in 2014 we *still* have issues with spaces in path names. I *am* a little surprised to see Xcode having this particular issue, but then I'm paranoid about spaces in paths, and generally avoid them whenever possible (camelCaseFTW ;-) ).</p><p>Nice catch, and glad you found the issue, even if it is whitespace related. *sigh* ;-)</p></div>
