		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, all NCDevCon videos are available on-line at the moment they stop recording. It is all automated and set up by our awesome host at NC State University College of Textiles. It made manning the AV a breeze. I understand that much of the equipment was updated over the past year so it should be even better for NCDevCon 2014 in September.</p><p>So when the recording period is over, your words of wisdom were leaping out into the Internet to anyone who clicked. Thanks so much for the support you and all the other speakers have given NCDevCon and TACFUG.</p></div>
