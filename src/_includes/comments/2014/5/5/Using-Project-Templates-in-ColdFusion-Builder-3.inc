		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks. I just got through writing an extension in CFBuilder 2 that does basically this. I was wondering though, if you know, how I can get the username information into an extension. I was able to use $${USERNAME} in my snippets, but don't see that available for extensions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My systems are too large for desktop editing. (very large databases and millions of image/asset files). I use a set of  development servers. I do use local file CFM/CFC editing with FTP on save.</p><p>I just put in RDS as another example of settings that were easy to set up in CFB 2 but difficult in CFB 3. I don't use RDS and it's off even on my dev servers for security concerns.</p><p>In DW4-6 you can just set up an FTP connection and have the IDE auto upload on save.  Easy to set up and works every time.</p><p>Even in CFB 2 you can open files from FTP and save to FTP which is not the best but at least it works. It's right on the file menu and is simple to set up.</p><p>In CFB 3 you cannot open a file from FTP and setting up a sync is a convoluted, undocumented process that simply does not work well if it works at all. Getting it sort of wset up involves setting up a Team Sync in another Perspective and then you might be able to get the view from that perspective to show up in the CF perspective. Even if you do, you have to take the extra step to sync your changes to the server every time which is hit or miss.</p><p>The Adobe forums have the same complaints concerning the remote dev process with no resolutions.</p><p>Also the tag editor is gone or at least any method to get to it is so well hidden it should be declared leagly dead. In CFB 2, it was a simple icon on the CFML toolbar (if you can call half a dozen buttons a toolbar. Tag insight is not as simple to me as a tag editor.</p><p>All in all, I'm just tired after hours of trying to get this stuff to work and a little angry at the difficulty of using the IDE. Homesite and Dreamweaver were never this difficult. It's seems silly.</p><p>Thanks for the response. You are a real asset to the CF community.</p></div>
