		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray. Is there a specific reason that these are no longer offered as an HTML download? I know they were for CF9 and previous versions, but it looks like PDF only with CF10 and CF11.</p><p>I found them MUCH more convenient than the PDFs for offline research (I spend quite amount of time in flight, etc.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Honestly no, I don't know. I always used the local PDFs as I felt like I could search them faster. If you don't prefer the PDF, maybe try the Dash version (if you are on OSX).</p></div>
