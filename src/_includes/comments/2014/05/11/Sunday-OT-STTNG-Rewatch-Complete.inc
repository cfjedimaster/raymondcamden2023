		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yay for rewatching it!  I never really got all the Wesley hate either.  Yes, he was eager and at times naive, but he was also a teenager.  Some people remarked that he was too "goodie" but considering the entire culture of humanity at that point, I'd have been more surprised and disappointed if he'd acted like a "typical" teen today. :-)</p><p>I liked Troi okay myself, though I wish the whole Imazadi thing with Riker had been explored more versus being a quick connection in the first episode then a random plot device later.  The two Imazadi books by Peter David are great reads for that side of it (also helps round out Troi's character more).  My favorite episode with her though was the one where she lost her powers and had to live without the edge of knowing how everyone else feels (i.e. normal) :-D</p><p>DS9 is indeed very Cardassian rich, so if you wanted to know more about them, it shouldn't be too disappointing.  Bajor, the Maquis, and those fun Ferengi also feature quite a bit. :-)</p><p>Are you planning to watch Voyager the same as well?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>re: Imzadi - You know - I kinda dig what they did there. They had a connection - it was kind of romantic - kinda not - but it was subtle. It wasn't the typical "will they ever hook up" type thing and I think it was better for it.</p><p>re: Voyager - Yep - definitely. I watched even less of that. I watched all of Enterprise, but I'm going to rewatch that too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Have fun!</p><p>While I personally prefer the movies with the old crew and the Next Generation episodes, DS9 has its redeeming moments (like "In The Pale Moonlight" and "Far Beyond the Stars" during the sixth season).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wouldn't mind doing a complete re-watch myself, though I've seen all of the episodes multiple times already. Right on about John Delancie as Q. FYI, Chris Hardwick recently did a GREAT interview with him on Nerdist, and it's interesting to hear more about him personally, outside of that character. He's a genuinely interesting guy, and he also helped get a documentary about Bronies made! His relationship with the entire "My Little Pony" fandom is hilarious.</p><p>"Inner Light" always stands out to me as the greatest single episode. Really strong writing in that one, and oddly enough it was kind of low-key with the space action. Other huge favorites for me were "Yesterday's Enterprise" and "Cause and Effect". I can't help but laugh a bit when Kelsey Grammer pops onto the viewscreen at the end.</p><p>FWIW, I really thought they made a great effort with the final episode, too. Similar to what Vince Gilligan did with "Breaking Bad", there was a lot of fan service, making a real effort to give loyal viewer and long-time Trek fans what they wanted. Lots of action, lots of those "what happens after Picard is no longer Captain" type moments. The time jumping was a little belabored at points, but I think they pulled it off. I was in the Army at the time, and remember watching it together with a bunch of fellow soldiers who were fans. We all digged it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have just embarked on the journey as well. My son (11) wanted to watch the Star Trek movies. So we travelled with Kirk, Spock et. al. through those movies. Then we watched Generations. Then he wanted to watch First Contact. Well, I figured he needed to know who the Borg were before watching that one, so I was going to carefully select the episodes with Q, and the Borg. After digging up some "best episode" lists to round out our watching, the list was quite long. So I gave up on that approach and decided we would watch the entire ST:TNG series. We will follow up with DS9 and Voyager. Then we might watch Enterprise or ST:TOS. I figure it will take 2 years at an average of 1 episode per day.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Btw - I watched the first ep (well, first half, it is a two parter) of DS9 this morning. Damn - damn - damn - was I surprised. I remembered the cast, but I didn't remember liking *all* of them. And the scene with Sisko and Picard? The *seething* hatred on his face. Amazing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good post.  I'm pretty sure my all time favorite STNG episode was called "The Inner Light" where Picard lived that whole other life based on a probe connecting with him.
