		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have not had the good fortune to attend cf.Objective() as it has been difficult to get out-of-state travel approved by my employer.  I might have a bit easier time next year, though, especially if I were to submit a topic and have it actually selected.  Changing the name wouldn't matter a whit to me personally, but I can where it would potentially widen the pool of people interested in attending.  Of course I don't have the sentimental attachment to the name that many long-time attenders may have.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 for a name change.</p><p>I got into CF dev last year after years of doing "Everything Else" (tm), web-wise, and the only reason cf.objective was even on my radar was because my employer told me about it and also paid my way there. I pretty much focused on all of the non-CF topics while I was there, so it was pretty much a dev.objective conference to me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Even as an erstwhile CFML dev, the non-CFML-oriented presentations held more interest for me. I have the technical wherewithal to teach myself the CFML stuff, whereas often I'm not even aware of the subject material on the other tracks.</p><p>I think the name CF.Objective() does indeed reduce the appeal of the conference beyond the scope of the existing CFML community, so an evolution of name would be a good marketing decision.</p><p>I think it's more web-oriented still than general "dev" so the suggested name might still need some thought.</p><p>-- <br>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have not been able to attend ever, but each year the sessions, CF and non-cf have looked really great. I figured last year and why CF was down was because it was between releases, and I hope there are more newer sessions this year. <br>However, I do agree, it would be great to get more out of CF speakers to give a different perspective on other tech...if you read blogs from people like Sean Corfield, he goes to a lot of different conferences and gets a different perspective on JS, Design and other aspects of development. So, changing the name of cfObj without killing its mission would probably attract more speakers from outside the CF arena, and be good for everyone, and it might even bring back some of our former developer friends to speak about what they work on now...the Marc Echers, Sam Farmers, Sean Corfields and others...they have great skills that might help all of us broaden our toolbox. <br>This was a great note to put up Ray, it really should get our community and All your followers to think...it sure got me thinking...well written piece and well done posting.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand I see CF.Objective() as a possible launching point for people unfamiliar with ColdFusion. Somewhere they can learn about the power of the language.  Something Adobe does not provide (i.e. marketing of ColdFusion). So in this regards I think CF.Objective() benefits the ColdFusion community. Obviously that is only true if there is still ColdFusion content during the conference. And, unfortunately, I agree with the sentiment that non-ColdFusion devs are probably not going to CF.Objective() anyway.</p><p>On the other hand I see that a name change would definitely benefit the conference itself. For the conference I think it makes sense to break away from the "CF" tag. I do believe this will open up the conference to a larger, more diverse, audience. So for the conference's sake, yes I agree a name change would be in order.  I'm just sad to see another bit of the ColdFusion universe die off.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Changing the name would only be a minor step toward shifting the perception of the conference. The major part would be successfully promoting the conference outside of the cfml community. A name change would not transfer the reputation cf.Objective() has accrued over the years to a wider audience. And generally speaking, developers must be choosy regarding the conferences they can attend because of time and budget constraints.</p><p>There is the possibility that diluting the brand would reduce attendance levels, sending a signal the the CFML tribe that this conference isn't targeted to you anymore. New Coke is the famous example of this: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNew_Coke%3AQD-TXeYJoqCwA0z60UgiwsqtHcU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I attended cf.Objective for the first time this year and it was an excellent conference and I'm hoping to go back next year. As a long time CF developer I was attracted to the conference because of the name and association with CF, but I must admit that over the 3 days of the conference I think I only attended 1 or 2 CF related session. The range of other topics covering things I had either never heard of or never had the time to look into myself was just excellent and one of the things that made the conference worth attending.</p><p>I like Mark's suggestion of web.Objective as well, however I think if it loses it's association to CF completely then this could have other ramifications for the conference, like losing it's sponsorship from Adobe, Railo, Mura, etc... and the sessions, like the BOF sessions, that this brings with it, which would be a shame.</p></div>

So, changing the name, will not, or should not change how they have structured the conference, it might bring in others from the area that don't know it has sessions on JS, or Design.</p><p>Very interesting read...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not clear on what the goal of changing the name is. Is it to attract more non-CF devs to the CF platform, or just to this particular conference? If it's the former, then I think the name change could backfire. Increasing the proportion of non-CF devs in attendance will probably accelerate the trend toward less CF content, which, if anything, will increase the rate at which current CF devs are losing interest in the platform.</p><p>If cf.Objective is going to continue moving toward less CF content and more everything else, then I don't really care what it's named, or how large an audience it attracts. Without the CF, it's just another web dev conference. If that's what you want it to be, then obviously you would support removing "cf" from the name.</p></div>

Then again, CFO has always been about pushing us out of our comfort zone, hasn't it?</p><p>As an aside, I found it interesting to look back on session topics over time: <br>2007<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20070329021717%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfobjective.com%2Fconference%2Findex.cfm%3Fevent%3Dpage.sessions%3AFo3pY6gfycootDSWD3V6Jxrsz3o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20070329021717/http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/index.cfm?event=page.sessions">https://web.archive.org/web...</a><br>2010<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20100829225536%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfobjective.com%2Findex.cfm%2Fsessions%2F%3A0u_HISgXsMsMCfzG6n0PSvIcD70&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20100829225536/http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/sessions/">https://web.archive.org/web...</a><br>2011<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20110419205039%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfobjective.com%2Findex.cfm%2Fsessions%2F%3AZasRJtO0rM8GphJaIpL_FUSaSKo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20110419205039/http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/sessions/">https://web.archive.org/web...</a><br>2013<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2F2013.cfobjective.com%2Fsessions%2F%3AyTpOihPDt-DDuFUvsv-kI57L5z4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://2013.cfobjective.com/sessions/">http://2013.cfobjective.com...</a><br>2014<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2F2014.cfobjective.com%2Fsessions%2F%3AAtKnCjPIbqn0yd3gh7re68lPKgQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://2014.cfobjective.com/sessions/">http://2014.cfobjective.com...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just back from vacation so I thought I'd pitch in. Disclaimer: I'm part of the cf.Objective() Steering Committee and have been, with only a couple of short breaks, ever since it got started.</p><p>Web development has changed and is continuing to change. CFML developers generally need to know a lot more than just CFML to build modern web apps these days.</p><p>cf.Objective() has already recognized that by adding a js.Objective() track and expanding the front-end / mobile content offered at the conference.</p><p>Having it be "primarily a CFML conference" and having "CF" in the name do act as a barrier to attracting more attendees and more diverse speakers. CFML-specific content has dropped to around half (in 2013 - it was actually higher in 2014) and that's a reflection of what topics are submitted - and popular enough in voting to be accepted. Most CFML developers want more than "just CFML".</p><p>Scotch on the Rocks ended up with no CFML content because the folks it attracts submitted talks on other topics and because public voting favored non-CFML content. But it's never had CF in its name so it was easier to attract non-CFML devs (and speakers).</p><p>CFinNC became NCDevCon and it has expanded its appeal, while retaining a loyal CFML following.</p><p>Changing cf.Objective() to dev.Objective(), for example, while keeping as much CFML content as the talk submissions and voting process show is desired, would make it easier to attract non-CFML devs and non-CFML speakers (and, yes, possibly bringing back some of the "old favorites" who no longer do CFML dev). So, yes, such a name change would directly benefit the conference organization.</p><p>But a thriving conference organization makes it easier to continue offering CFML content to those who want it, alongside all the other content that has a broader appeal.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've attended 6 cf.Objectives() and have been proud to speak at 5 of them. I'd love to continue attending but I don't really write CF these days. A name change could go a long way towards making this conference more interesting to people outside of the CF community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A name change and focus shift makes sense, sure. I'd argue that as long as a CF track is kept, it would allow for those who prefer to focus on CF (all or in part) to still be served. And who knows: perhaps some who'd attend for the other stuff might perhaps consider attending a CF topic if it was somehow generically interesting.</p><p>I think all this (as well as the slowing in CF user groups) is just reflective of the maturing of the language and the community. Some may see it as reflecting the demise and/or death of CF (thankfully no one has said that here), but I think that would be overstating things.</p><p>As has been made plain in the original post and from others here, most CFers do have their hand in other things (and should), and while cf.o has tried to cater to their growth outside the CF walls (even cajoled and led them to other things in their rich array of sessions), it's a reasonable next step to broaden things.</p><p>And of course we have the CF Summit which will also reasonably remain CF-focused, as well as the other traditionally CF-oriented conferences with varying levels of CF/CFML content.</p><p>But I do hope that a CF-specific track would be kept at cf.o, rather than losing topics in a sea of other possible ones. One could even argue benefit for the cf-oriented attendees, by having them having one track, so that they may tend to see the chosen CF-oriented talks whereas now there are often many and they may miss ones for all the choice. Of course, they'd still have the other tracks to choose from. :-)</p><p>As others have pointed out, it may be somewhat a challenge with respect to any hope to make the conference bigger and reach more people (outside of CF), but that's natural to any new conference (and this would be "new" in that sense). The folks behind the conference, and the core of speakers, would certainly form a great base, and while there may be some dwindling of "primarily CF attendees" perhaps that would be balanced by a growth in "primarily non-CF attendees".</p><p>Seems like a smart strategy which could pay dividends down the road, without any real harm to the core CF orientation (until such time that it may naturally no longer have enough to even warrant its own track). That could be some time, so plenty of time it seems to see how things would shake out.</p><p>Whatever is decided, I wish the best for all involved.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To your point about a cf-specific track, Charlie, in 2013 about half the content at cf.Objective() was CF-specific and in 2014 it was slightly higher, so it would be more than one track's worth of content in 2015 (assuming that we continue to receive that level of CF-specific submissions and people vote for them in the Engage app!).</p><p>However, I think clearly tagging sessions as better technology-specific vs technology-neutral is a good idea. We've had requests in the past to clearly tag the "level" of talks as well and/or list prerequisite knowledge more clearly. All good suggestions for the future.</p></div>
