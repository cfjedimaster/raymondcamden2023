		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, thanks for the quick blog entry on CommandBox.  I wanted to let you know that we recently renamed the slug for ColdBox to from "coldbox-platform" to just "coldbox" in case you want to update the little sample command in your entry.</p><p>install coldbox</p><p>We're just trying to get some better parity with how NPM does stuff, where the name of the package is the default folder name the package is installed to.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got into Rails development for some personal projects and fell in love with the command line tools and console to run code. Package management with ruby gems and bundler was great. Gems would require other gems for dependencies and things would just work.</p><p>I have had CommandBox installed for a while but haven't played with it too much. As our company transitions !ore to Coldbox, I imagine it may become especially useful, especially with running tests.</p><p>Others should check it out if they haven't had exposure to CLIs and package management.</p></div>
