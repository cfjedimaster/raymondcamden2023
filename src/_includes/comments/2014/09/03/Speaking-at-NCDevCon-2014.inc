		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm stoked that you are making it to NCDevCon again. I hope you have a good time in our fair city. I've been hoping to get a chance to look at Ionic, but there is only so much time to explore new things. It will be good to have a jump start by someone who is good at describing new stuff to noobs.</p></div>
