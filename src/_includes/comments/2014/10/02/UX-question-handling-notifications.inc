		<div class="comment_text"><p>Adding my own comment. ;) I just realized - I think Facebook is doing this perfectly. They don't mark all as read when you click on a notification, they have a way to mark all as read, and they have a way to clear individual items out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like the way stackoverflow does it because I don't look at it as responded to, I simply see it as it's notifying me that something happened. Once i click on that icon and open it up, I see that things happened. If I want to go back later and react to it, I still can, because notifications stay in that box for a good while.</p><p>I don't use google+ or facebook enough to comment on the other two areas.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agree with the points you are making, although I find the Facebook implementation incomplete, too, just because the titlebar marker goes immediately back to 'inactive' after opening the list, even if only one (or none) of several messages / posts have actually been read. Makes it tough to tell whether all have been read without going back to open the menu over and over as you work through the list.</p></div>
