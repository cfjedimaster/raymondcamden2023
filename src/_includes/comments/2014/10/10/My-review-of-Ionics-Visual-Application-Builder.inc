		<div class="comment_text"><p>I too have taken Creator for a spin and being logging issues. It is still very much Alpha but shows great potential.</p><p>I would like to see more Ionic components (AngularJS directives) added with their API exposed in the property inspector. I have not seen how to build whate the Page templetes give you for example.</p><p>I too would like to see code moved out of index.html to app.js.</p><p>There are 25,000 people signed up waiting to take a look, so it would seem there is a lot of interest in this type of product; strong community should lead to a strong product. I am looking forward to following the life of Creator (and antics of @ionitron)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I tried this POS today and thought it was terrible. I can't even drag elements into the page. Tried in Safari and Chrome. You can't change backgrounds or modify CSS or even add an extra tab. Maybe I am missing something but it's zero percent useful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You should probably ask for your money back then. ;) Seriously though - as a free tool - calling it a POS is a bit extreme imo. It definitely has room to grow. Did you try filing issues for your suggestions? You can do so here: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdriftyco%2Fionic-creator-issues%3A7zh_P2TJEkCmMXc3D3d1FtbOHF0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-creator-issues">https://github.com/driftyco...</a>. As I think I mentioned above, I think this tool does a good job of getting you started. Since the CLI provides an easy easy way to grab the source, you can then take it and run.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you for the honest feedback, seriously. It needs work, and will probably morph quite a bit over time. Some of it is just quirks in the tool (like needing a form first before dragging in inputs), and some of it is just bugs.</p><p>Honestly, it's not really the tool I dreamed of before we created it, and we have some ideas on how to transform it over time, so stay tuned.</p></div>
