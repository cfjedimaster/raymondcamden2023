		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm Pete, I do Web Development (CF and PHP serverside), Phonegap/Cordova with AngularJS, as well as Native mobile  app development, and all the stuff that fills in the gaps between those 2 (LAMP, APIs, HTML/CSS etc)</p><p>I want to try Ionic as I'm using Cordova/Angular anyway, and I really want to upgrade CF9...</p><p>I've realised in recent years there's rarely a "best way" to do anything, and with so many technologies around that makes life difficult when starting from a clean slate... any one else feel that way? Too much choice?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I do CF server side and AngularJS/Wijmo on the front end.  I just need something for those widgets.  Like many tech folks I like SF/Fantasy and the occasional Computer Game.  But with 2 young adopted kids I don't have much time for indulgence!</p><p>Re: "Pete Williamson"<br>There is a lot of choice, but I guess that's a good thing.  The problem is when your choice ends up fading away and you have to choose something else.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Jim that makes it even harder to choose.</p><p>When I opted to pick up Angular I looked at Backbone and Underscore, did a load of examples/tutorials and went with Angular, the 2 way binding sold it to me back then.</p><p>But I'm always fearful of making the wrong choice, in case some fancy piece of new tech dies out quickly or gets replaced by a bigger effort backed by a software giant (in the case of Angular/Underscore, I would have been fine either way)</p><p>This is why blogs like this are great, people like Ray pioneer the new tech and take the first steps for us.</p><p>R.e. video games, I took about 5 years off, bought an Xbox 360 in Feb this year... I now have a 5 year back catalogue of bargain games to play. The desire to spend 2k on a gaming PC is fading...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>super quick response as I'm currently on the other side of planet where it is near 5am - pete - I understand your concern - but unless you talking about a framework that has very little users - you pretty much *can't* make a wrong choice. Angular is more popular (afaik) than Backbone, but Backbone has a *lot* of users. Learning it would *not* be a waste and would just complement your existing skill set. (Personally I prefer Angular over Bootstrap.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ha, thanks Ray. I think you've actually given me similar advice before regarding Phonegap and Native development.</p><p>You're right, another string to the bow - but I really want to try Ionic, Node and now Firebase looks great as well... there's not enough time to work, learn all this new tech, raise children and still have time to replay Halo 2.</p><p>Oh and <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FFamo.us%3ADvGi5-b6ZltJK0mhsxQjGHBfjpM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Famo.us">Famo.us</a> as well, lots of hype around that, want to try that out too.</p></div>
