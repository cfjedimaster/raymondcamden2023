		<div class="comment_text"><p>Donnie, I happened to be looking at this today. Seems <br>Iike Sublime support is only available with SublimeLinter3 which is a Sublime 3 package.</p><p>I had thrown it at a smaller application. I got a lot of warnings back that had no description. Need to take a closer look but this is a great start and better than nothing at all. It's like varscoper taken to the next level.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Donnie I'm not. I don't think there's been an update to ST3 beta in close to a year. I think the maintainer dropped off.</p><p>I was going to give ST3 beta a shot really for purpose of integrating directly in with CFLint but the prospect of retooling all my configurations, packages, and everything else seemed a bit daunting. Also, some people on my team noted some issues with our project in ST3. I could see in the console it trying to constant read a non-open file that is particularly lengthy. ST2 has issues opening up. I think it screws with the formatter. But again, only when you actively try to open it. ST3 had things in the console log if it trying to constantly read it. Probably some sort of caching feature or something...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great extension, thanks Ray! When I first tried running this, I was getting an error in CF Builder: CFLint: Error occurred while parsing response from handler "/handlers/runlint.cfm". I discovered (through one of your previous blog posts) that this was because I had CF debugging enabled on the server I was running the extension against. I disabled debugging and the extension works great!</p><p>Hope this comment helps anyone else who might run across this issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray, I discovered your blog entry after getting CFLint going... Saw it in a Sublime blog somewhere, never got it running there, but went ahead and tooled up to install it as a stand-alone and VERY happy, though it has a way to go.<br>Just as an aside, I've been using Chris Weller's "CodeChecker" for some time, a linter written in ColdFusion and extensible as well, but nowhere near as fast as CFLint.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, I noted that the cflint extention for CFBuilder works for CF 10. Does it also work for CF 11? We are migrating from CF 9 to CF 11 and want to do some testing of how much code may be affected by the removed tags and tag parameters. A lint checker seemed like a nice way to do this.</p></div>
