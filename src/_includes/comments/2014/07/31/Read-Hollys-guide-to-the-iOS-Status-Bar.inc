		<div class="comment_text"><p>What the user too often sees in the iOS status bar, and more so elsewhere on the screen (like at the bottom), looks and works like "quantum mechanics". Programming it shouldn't be any less tricky - to be fair.  Every UI guideline seems to be lawfully violated.  Coding for it might just be the easy part.</p><p>(I keep my Twitter involvement to a minimum already thank you.)</p></div>
