		<div class="comment_text"><p>Seriously, "racist Adobe" - your comment loses all credibility with crap like that.</p><p>You aren't getting a surcharge because you aren't American, you are getting a surcharge due to currency differences.</p><p>Now - you may not accept that - but it certainly isn't racism.</p><p>By the way, I work with many people in Asia.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just want to say Thank you. Amazing article. Phonegap is a great tool to use but I think it is not for the beginners. I recently made an app with the Configure.IT. It's a nice tool. Just try it, you will love it. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.configure.it%2Ffeatures%2Fmobile-app-configuration%2F%3Ai8nYqF2hpcaGaPB6OLVeZ--6IFA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.configure.it/features/mobile-app-configuration/">http://www.configure.it/fea...</a></p></div>
