		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK... one issue I see with this "verified" plugin site is that there is no easy to way to contribute to this list (I'm guessing Eddie V. is doing all the "verifying", so he determines if your code stinks or not).  I can see a situation where some great plugins don't make it into this curated list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah you correct.  I'm really sorry to react the way I have.</p><p>I saw this news on the PhoneGap blog and don't fully understand why it is there because its pretty much marketing for Telerik's platform services (which aren't free).  However I can see this info being useful to those that are currently using Telerik's "UI for PhoneGap" so I guess I've lost this argument.</p><p>In my perspective most plugins are a hack because developers using PhoneGap are likely  JS ninjas and not skilled in Objective-C/Java.  Why would skilled Objective-C/Java coders create PhoneGap plugins if they don't use the platform?  There is no need for them to make the "gap" and re-create a JS interface that communicates with the native side.  I'm not trying to impose the PhoneGap team is not skilled in native code either.</p><p>Overall I'm sorry for trolling this post, I do appreciate your blog posts, you're welcome to delete these comments here.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, no worries man. I don't mind. I do think you bring up some interesting points.</p><p>First, two Telerik being a commercial entity - I think commercial services offered around an open source platform are good. It just improves what you can do with the platform, know what I mean?</p><p>I do not agree about your plugin statement though. Plugins fill a role, and yes, they are developed by people who know the native language, but they help those of using Cordova to build better apps, so the 'why' is pretty obvious. And heck, maybe they build em because they are paid to do so. ;)</p><p>Also - some folks know both. I know a bit of ObjectiveC myself.</p></div>
