		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, thanks for this.  I have been struggling with documents (PDF's mainly) not indexing due to failures and, in some cases crashing the index process completely.  I visit the forums all of the time.  The two most common being the extracttext error mentioned above and the invalid bfchar range pattern error.  Neither has been addressed.  Not even an idea of how to get around it when we are talking about almost 40000 documents.</p></div>
