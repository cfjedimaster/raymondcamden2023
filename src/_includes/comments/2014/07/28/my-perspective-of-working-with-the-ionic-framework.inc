		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, but that isn't an Ionic issue, it is a Cordova issue. You can't build to iOS from Windows. You *can* use PhoneGap Build to do so of course. So you could use Ionic, do most of your work in the browser, and send stuff to PGB for iOS builds.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Robert: I know that is said tongue in cheek, but I honestly agree with it. If you want to develop for iOS, you really want to get a Mac. Heck, you can always get one of the cheap Mac minis and just use it as a secondary system. I've got nothing against Windows, I really like it, but OSX has long felt more developer friendly to me. But again - if you want to stick with Windows, go for a cheap mini.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice write-up. I appreciate the technical pros/cons. There is so much going in this space it’s tough to stay on top of it all and make informed decisions. I’m still at the research stage to find the right dev environment for my app which ideally will be deployed on mobile (iOS, Android). Native like performance is a big criteria for my app (a productivity app) and it's one that I don't see ionic tackling very well at this moment. Neither do they provide a build service. With the limited research I've done, the apps I've seen from ionic seem pretty trivial. I'm looking at ionic however, as well as Appgyver Steroids. Steroids seems to have a more complete platform offering a build service, and actual native performance on some levels (using a multi-page architecture for transitions and easier debugging). In addition, they employ ionic as their default UI framework and their generators user Angular. It will be interesting to see where these two go and if they go head-to-head.</p><p>Question: Have you looked at AppGyver Steroids?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Gabe Summer</p><p>You can build iOS PhoneGap/Cordova apps using just about any tool and any operating system you want. Up until a point, that is when you want to test it on a device and deploy it. Then you have to buy a Mac. I don't think there is any way around that at the moment.</p><p>I believe the most complete development environment at the moment is Visual Studio 2013 with the Hybrid App tools. Visual Studio is entirely free, it has, by far, the best emulator for Android, and it will debug your app on your Mac/device when you get one. You'll have to get one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hybrid is a viable solution for simple apps, but I have worked on some stuff that is not entirely simple, and we had to abandon both basic Angular+HTML and Ionic for performance reasons. I believe this is at least partly an Angular issue, and it is being worked on actively by the Angular team, but probably only for Angular 2, which is a complete re-write of (and totally incompatible with) Angular 1.x. When I say totally incompatible with, I mean "none of your code will work at all, and there is no upgrade path" incompatible.</p><p>For complex data-driven apps, I have found only two viable cross-platform solutions for mobile and that is Xamarin and (aaaahhhh, gulp) Flex. And perhaps doing it in pure Javascript no major framework (I'd rather shoot my self in the knee) I'd love to hear about alternatives.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As I say in a post below, we have had major performance issues with Ionic and also with "barebones" Angular. It seems the Ionic team is working hard on performance, and hopefully they are tight with the Angular team. At the moment, Ionic is not an option for us though, and it probably won't be for a while. That means Ionic is out at least until mid-2016 or so, probably end of 2016.</p><p>The reason it is out for so long is that obviously we could do stuff on Ionic at the moment, and assume performance increases in both Angular and Ionic, but since all the code we eventually did in an app now would have to be thrown away when migrating to Angular 2, we have to assume the same would be the case for Ionic. In other words, there is no point in doing Ionic apps until Ionic is on Angular 2 since Angular 2 will require not only a complete re-write of my Angular apps, it will certainly require a complete re-write of Ionic.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Bill, We've worked with AppGyver as well for our LOB apps, and it has some of the same problems as Ionic/Angular+HTML/Etc have. Performance suffers noticeably as the complexity of the app increases, and we saw, at times, pretty bad performance as the number of bindings went past the trivial. For us that has meant doing native apps at the time, while investigating stuff like Xamarin. We have found that Xamarin gives the performance we require, so going forward we are using that for our new offerings. Xamarin Forms does not suffer the way the JS frameworks do as the number of bindings go up. BTW, on web-apps used from a PC, this is not an issue at all, so we use Angular there all the time.</p><p>Checking with the Angular team, I have a high confidence level with regards to their fixing performance issues on mobile, it is a high priority for them it seems. The problem is (as I say below) that this is for the Angular 2.0 re-write scheduled for release about a year from now. Since the re-write is entirely incompatible with Angular 1, so we see no point in doing anything Angular on mobile until 2016. It's a pity, we'd love to have our mobile and our standard browser-based stuff on similar platforms.</p><p>As for build and test of Cordova/Ionic/AppGyver/Angular... apps, astonishingly I now find Visual Studio to be better than anything else. We've had a couple of guys evaluating this stuff, and it is awesome. Build, debug all of that stuff works (with a few hitches, the build system is a technical preview) amazingly well. Debugging on iOS devices, on Android devices and the new Android emulator for Microsoft, which is heads, shoulders, torso and half a thigh better than the Google Android emulator. I wish the Google stuff was half the quality of Microsoft's current beta dev environment.</p></div>

If you have time, please drop us a mail at contact@appgyver.com</p><p>As for performance of AngularJS in hybrid apps – it's not hard to write bad performing AngularJS code, so a lot of time the big performance hits come from suboptimal coding (not implying that was necessarily the case with you guys). In any case, we're really looking forward to seeing how Angular 2.0 improves performance, as well as it being elevated to a full UI framework too with Material Design.</p><p>In any case, I just want to drop off with the note that Supersonic (which replaces the old Steroids.js) is platform agnostic – while the default projects utilize AngularJS, all the core functionalities are really independent from any frameworks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, thanks for answering me. During this phase I was working on Angular only and later Ionic, not AppGyver. I can therefore only repeat what they said in our discussions and after asking them.</p><p>The main problem, as I understand it, was performance on Android. Our requirements was that performance on mid-end devices was good, and we could apparently not get satisfactory performance on several devices, for example the Galaxy SIII.</p><p>I do understand that performance on Android has been a focus, so that may no longer be a problem, but we've since moved on. Obviously we are regularly revisiting tools options, and it's a guarantee that AppGyver will be in our next round of testing. Probably this summer (lower pressures in the summer, more time to "play around").</p></div>
