		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,</p><p>Saw your review come across the pipeline, and wanted to stop by and offer my thanks for your balanced and useful assessment. We're always trying to get better, and your constructive feedback is valuable to us in that process. You have my appreciation both for taking the course and for affording it a perceptive eye tuned toward improvements.</p><p>We have used JSBP as a way of testing new challenges that serve the diverse learning styles in our learning community. The new language-based challenges are used to serve the linguistic modalities of intelligence that likely exist within a significant component of our students. You've probably heard of these in some commonly cited educational research on theories of learning, i.e. Howard Gardner's popular framework, and other close derivatives.</p><p>To attract students with different learning styles, and build within them a confidence that they've made useful knowledge progress, we've tried to use research to strike a balance between exercises that build upon the obvious spatial and logical components of learning code, and other exercises that use language-based skills to reinforce conceptual material, employing methods that have had empirical success.</p><p>With that said, some challenge styles are certainly not everybody's cup of tea. We take the success metrics associated with these challenges seriously, as well as helpful reviews like yours, and make modifications accordingly.</p><p>I'm much obliged to you for your time, energy, and thoughtful consideration. Thanks for hanging with the course.</p><p>Jason</p></div>
