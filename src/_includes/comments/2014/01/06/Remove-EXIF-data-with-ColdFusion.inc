		<div class="comment_text"><p>When do the Exif data actually get dropped? In the first write or in the second read? <br>Try this.<br>ImageRead() &gt; Any Edit &gt; imageWrite().

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This isn't directly on topic, but it relates to reading/changing/deleting image metadata.  When you right-click a JPEG file in Windows and go to Properties &gt; Details, Windows will expose a variety of metadata.  For example on a JPG file I scanned, under a sub-heading of Image, there are listed Dimensions, Width, Height, Horizontal Resolution, Vertical Resolution and Bit Depth.  I initially assumed this was EXIF data, yet if I use imageGetExifMetadata(myImage), I get an empty structure.  If I cfdump #myImage# I can see height and width, but no other metadata.  I also tried using a couple different Exif/IPTC/XMP viewers/editors and those all come up empty.  So my question is, if these values are not EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata, what are they and is it possible to read them with Coldfusion?  I'm particularly interested in the Resolution fields which are populated by the scanner software.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, for anyone who might also be interested, I solved my problem using Steven Erat's ImageMetadata.cfc (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimagemetadata.riaforge.org%2F%29%3Axl75z8e8xpJ5x9IUvl7iffUlPK4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://imagemetadata.riaforge.org/)">http://imagemetadata.riafor...</a>, which is a simple Coldfusion cfc wrapper for the above mentioned ExifTool.  By default, the CFC only parses the XMP namespaced tags, but adding in -exif:all into the cfexecute arguments brings in all the EXIF tags as well.  And sure enough, all the values I am interested in are included in that EXIF data - even though several other EXIF readers, including CF's native tag, did not expose those values.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>EDIT:   My original jpg files had no EXIF data whatsoever which is why all the other EXIF readers found nothing.  Yet the values of height, width and resolution still show up in Windows.  Once again, ExifTool to the rescue.  A complete command-line dump of *all* metadata for the file (using -s to display the actual tag name and -g to group them by namespace) exposes File:ImageHeight, File:ImageWidth, JFIF:XResolution, and JFIF:YResolution.  A little tinkering with Erat's CFC and - presto! - I can access these values via Coldfusion.  Many thanks to Mr. Harvey, Mr. Erat and Mr. Camden for sharing your vast knowledge!</p></div>
