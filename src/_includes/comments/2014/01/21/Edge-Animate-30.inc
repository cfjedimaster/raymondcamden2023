		<div class="comment_text"><p>- Still no search and replace for code window<br>- Completely stupid the way it duplicates images – This has to definitely change.<br>- Still impossible to tell which document you are working on – Should display a path in the top menu bar.<br>- Cannot reorganize Image files into folders<br>- Cannot organize symbols into common libraries!!!!<br>- Cannot undo - no history once you save<br>- No ability to Lock Elements position on screen without stopping you from accessing them<br>- Javascript error in event handler! Event Type = timeline!!! What a meaningless errors</p><p>Can't wait till they come out with a Flex like app for enterprise type development (That's how we are using it)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ability to lock symbols that are intended for dynamic generation would be a good idea. Then we could safely delete unused symbols. Currently I stick them in a symbol called _Keep and then drag that to the Stage just before going through each symbol 1 by one and deleting it. If a warning pops up that the asset is used I move to the next symbol.</p><p>Why not just globally do this? Very odd. Someone is obviously missing from the development team who should be 'Big picture design"</p><p>Whilst I'm here - Did I mention grouping symbols in folders?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Nicolas,</p><p>Animate Product Manager here. Ray pinged me about your comments, thanks for the feedback. As an FYI the core product team does monitor the forum and out social channels for outreach... we're quite receptive to constructive (and polite) feedback.</p><p>That being said I understand some of the frustrations you're facing with some of the (lack of) features you described. Are you using the latest version of CC? Some of the issues you're describing have been fixed in later update.</p><p>Some of the features you described are on our roadmap for a later release since we do understand these are pain points. Also keep in mind Animate is still an extremely new product and we have lots we want to do even in terms of the usability stuff you mentioned (as opposed to some of our other apps which have had 15+ years of development).</p><p>We'd love to hear more from you -- for the sake of Rays blog feel free to start a discussion on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.adobe.com%2Fcommunity%2Fedge_animate%3AjJEyj1HK5bJvQA9n3fa6JshNt5o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.adobe.com/community/edge_animate">http://forums.adobe.com/com...</a>.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, I had msgs you about a year ago about implementing my edge animations and you helped me a lot. So thanks!</p><p>Today I'd experiencing something really weird and really hope you have some insight on this. Today I looked back on this simple html5 site I did a year ago and noticed in Chrome that its all scrambled now. Objects are all out of place :S that's not how I last left it.</p><p>Got any ideas on how this happened, and hopefully how to fix it? Maybe a workaround? I'm considering to simply turn it into a video if this'll be such hassle every year.</p><p>Hope to hear from you!</p></div>
