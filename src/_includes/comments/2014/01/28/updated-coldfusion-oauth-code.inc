		<div class="comment_text"><p>Would these be considered oauth2 examples?  I was trying to connect to the API over at <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fdevelopers%2Fdocumentation%2Fgetting_started%2Foauth%3A_mu8eMFgSpWriIPWYCXw8S1BFxA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/oauth">https://www.etsy.com/develo...</a> which is listed as oAuth1.</p><p>It seems to be a whole different procedure using encryption, signatures, etc...</p><p>I thought I could start looking at your examples, but only the flow is the same... the variables are off.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Phillip, yep it was just a coincidence, although I posted links to @Ray's OAuth tutorials as I thought there were super helpful and why re-create an excellent wheel?</p><p>I'm one of those guys that's been working with CF since around 1999 and never really posted much, which I feel pretty bad about considering how often I look for postings by others to help out.  I"m trying to change that and give back by posting projects that might be helpful to others.</p><p>Hopefully they are.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ryan:</p><p>I'm all for giving back as well.<br>So here's been my problems/solutions to the whole giving back thing:<br>Problem: My examples are too simple / I'm a simpleton<br>Solution: Are you kidding me? If it's something that you had to figure out, then someone else might go through the same thing in the future and you could save them!</p><p>Problem: Yeah, but I don't want to show people my code because they might look at it and go "why did you do this?"<br>Solution: Are you kidding me?  Just tell them it's because you're stupid!</p><p>Problem: Well, the only website I work on is my employer's.<br>Solution: Are you kidding me? There are cheap hosting companies like <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostmedia.co.uk%3Akgeklp7FhTOkZjpxgvEKvn7DL-I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostmedia.co.uk">hostmedia.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostek.com%3ATIO_Pb2GQchMLhiMk1Fyw6JENuo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostek.com">hostek.com</a> and if you need to speak with someone one the phone, you can call <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostmysite.com%3AztrKeOUKmog7P-dSXj3cUUhcUfs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostmysite.com">hostmysite.com</a> 24x7 and they'll talk you through it.<br>As a matter of fact, I'm in the process of moving my proof-of-concept stuff over to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FPhillipSenn.net%3AOsvcyg1kMkzx9mdstq72-DxwfOQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="PhillipSenn.net">PhillipSenn.net</a>, hosted by <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostmedia.co.uk%3Akgeklp7FhTOkZjpxgvEKvn7DL-I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostmedia.co.uk">hostmedia.co.uk</a>. I hope to have lots of little example programs for people to see how each "thing" works - like "What does your jQuery Mobile template look like?" and I have an complete example showing a blank jQuery mobile page, showing the ColdFusion source code, the JavaScript source code, the CSS, the html that ColdFusion generates and the html that jQuery Mobile generates.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, <br>I realize this is an old post, but I have a client still on CF8 and yours seems to be the only OAuth2 libraries that support back that far, so I was very interested it taking a look. But the link to the archive no longer works.</p><p>Are these CFCs still available anywhere?</p><p>Thanks much!<br>-TD</p></div>
