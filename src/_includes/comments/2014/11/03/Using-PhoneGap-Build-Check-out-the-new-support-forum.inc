		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't realise there was a support forum already. I looked and immediately found an answer for a major problem I experienced a few weeks back with my IOS build: "PhoneGap is NOT compatible with IOS8 concerning Geolocation". Well that's not much of a setback. I mean, who uses Geolocation anyway? :-( You'd think they'd fix this as soon as IOS 8 was released.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary F: that's exactly my point. Currently, PGB support is way understaffed (as it seems). They can't keep up with support requests, and the back office has trouble keeping up with what Apple, Google and Microsoft are doing. <br>A new, second support forum would even require more resources from Adobe. Also, developers would have to look through archives on multiple forums to find Q&amp;A (which might even be ansered in contradiction to each other). They might decide to post the very same question to both places. Regular forum denizens who are willing to help, will then either be able to see just part of the Q&amp;A (when staying on one forum) or they are 'forced' to help out in multiple places simultaneously. <br>As developers know very well: redundancy is bad!</p></div>
