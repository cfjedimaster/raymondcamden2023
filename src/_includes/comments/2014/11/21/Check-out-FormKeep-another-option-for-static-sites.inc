		<div class="comment_text"><p>Isn't this just another example of where the user is the product? In my quick read I didn't see anything that talks about how they would "respect" your privacy. It seems like another way (ala facebook/google/linkedin/everybody) to harvest text, email addresses, relationships.</p><p>I'm getting a bit cynical in my dotage but I think I'm right.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Normally I'd say you are right to be cynical, but I think maybe you are going a bit too far here. I can say I ran into a few things that needed clarification (re: their docs). This may be another place where they should clarify their position. I'll ping them on Twitter.</p></div>
