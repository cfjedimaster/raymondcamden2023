		<div class="comment_text"><p>Coincidentally, I also migrated just last week comments to Disqus. I strongly recommand to use a "test account" first till you sure all got right. Imported comments I could also not update anymore. But I have to say they recommand to register first a test forum to make shure everything is smooth. <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150">https://help.disqus.com/cus...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, fair enough. I honestly would never have imagined that 'updating' would be such an issue. There is a unique ID I'm applying to my comments and you would think it would just replace them. And heck - I've deleted the darn comments now and they still won't update.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I messed up my import and forgot add "/blog" in my entry URLs. Since there is no way to delete should I just remove the domain and data and then just add the same site back in Disqus?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd mass delete. It took me maybe 30 minutes to kill my 6k imported. You could probably do it much quicker. Of course, I also had new live comments so making a new site may be simpler for you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So I am using your updated script and I still can't figure out what is going wrong. I also see all of my comments in the admin moderation section. I can also click on the entry link of the comment and be taken to the new site and the correct page. However none of the comments actually show up but any new comments created work just fine. I'm lost at this point.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So, as I mentioned, I *had* seen an issue where some early comments didn't show up, but it went away. Thinking. Are you using the JS variable to set the URL on the page? I mentioned that in one of my posts.</p></div>
