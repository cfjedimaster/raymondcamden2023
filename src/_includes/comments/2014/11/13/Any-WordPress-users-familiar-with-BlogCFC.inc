		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you want to stay in the CF world, ContentBox Modular CMS has BlogCFC converter built in.  I also wrote a BlogCFC Compatibility module that makes all your old URLs still work as well as a Blog Ping Module for aggregators.  In addition to being pluggable, it's themable out of the box (one-click installs) and if you want to extend it or write your own theme, you get to use CFML and not that nasty PHP :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian: That's the one I'm using. It has a few bugs that I'll share when I'm done with the conversion. Basically I'm done now except for a few issues:</p><p>a) Blog entries with a title that has a dash become -- in the URL. That works here, but not in WP. So I may need to handle that manually and create a  .htaccess file to map folks coming in from Google. If I can automate it, not a big deal. If I can't, it is a deal breaker as I have around 600+ of them.</p><p>b) I need to find a "stats" plugin. I use the "Views" property of my blog entries as a quick way to measure ow my blog is going and how each individual entry is going. I also have Google Analytics too, but the Views property is much simpler.</p><p>c) I find attaching things to WP blog posts awkward - and I'm guessing I can't automate the process for old entries. Oh wait... I bet I could. I can just add a direct link in the blog entry itself. Yeah, that's an option.</p></div>
