		<div class="comment_text"><p>Four girls??? Sounds like you had to outfit the bathrooms with traffic lights to manage that chaos every morning. ;)<br>And it's great timing for the new family members. First, candy time, then some time to get settled down, followed by a family holiday and after that it won't be long until you can teach them the family secrets for building a great snowman.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is awesome news and as an adopted child myself it makes me so happy to see someone else supporting and promoting adoption!  I feel like adoption is such an amazing, beautiful, wonderful thing that still carries some stigma and misunderstanding.  In my experiences with people who I tell I'm adopted it just seems like so many people don't get it.  I've even been asked if I love my adopted parents like "real" parents.  They are my real parents!  I feel the same amount of love and belonging to them as anyone else does for their biological parents.  I was no accident, they chose me!  How fortunate am I to be able to say that!  I've also watched others go through so much pain who aren't able to have their own children, spending thousands on fertility treatments.  There are so many children in the world out there that needs families, why is it so hard to consider adoption?</p><p>So thank you Ray, for giving all of these children the most wonderful gift ever: a happy loving family and home!  And thanks for helping spread the word! :)</p></div>
