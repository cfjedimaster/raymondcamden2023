		<div class="comment_text"><p>Of course I do - linked there on the right. ;) The reason I'm doing this is because the Disqus import is "entry" based. By that I mean the XML packet represents a blog entry (or article, whatever) with a list of comments. So I was concerned about doing my XML generation today and having new shit coming in over the weekend, etc. So basically I've made the current data 'read only' so I can generate my XML files. And I'll definitely share it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Really appreciate it Ray. So are you using a hosted version of Wordpress? I have never done any PHP work and not sure I want to start now. My goal is to just get everything off of my current blog so I can start fresh. Also I have a VPS that I really don't want to pay for anymore.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool :-)</p><p>I ended up writing conversion scripts as well when I flipped my site from using Mango Blog's built in system to Disqus.  But didn't have quite so many comments to go through @_@ :)</p><p>Are you having to write a converter for your blog entries, or were you able to find a pre-made one that can do it?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I found a BlogCFC to WP code project and it is working well. I forget who did it but when I do get to that point I'll share that code too (I had to make some small changes there too). For WP - I'm mostly happy with things but I'm being super cautious. I was pretty confident about *this* change. The WP one is a bit more scary.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Update - two issues.</p><p>a) For some reasons, my imported comments on my very first blog post don't show up. If *none* of my imports didn't work I'd understand. I've pinged support.</p><p>b) I screwed up times on my imports. :( So - I regenerated the XML, imported, but they don't show the right times. (They don't show times on old comments anyway, but the *order* is definitely wrong.) So again, I pinged support to ask about how replaced comments should work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One more question Ray. Moving to WordPress you didn't really need to move your comments to Disqus so I am curious as to why you did that? Pros/Cons?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good question. The script I'm using (and again, I didn't write it, just mod it) handled comments ok. But a) I like disqus and b) I'm trying to offload as much as possible to make things simpler. Also, I would need a plugin to handle comment subscriptions. Now - WordPress makes plugins hella easy, but I want to keep things as simple as possible with this install if that makes sense.</p><p>In general, going forward, any new site I have will use Disqus.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Makes total sense. I like the idea of keeping things simple. Plus if you ever decide to move off of WP to one of these other platforms my guess is they will support Disqus. Thanks!</p></div>
