		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few other things I thought of after Ray posted this for me...</p><p>We treat our employees well. Give me a few minutes to "talk" to Kyle and Barrett and they'll tell you themselves.</p><p>You set your own hours within reason. Barrett takes time to coach wrestling at the local high school. Kyle rides in bike races. We want you to enjoy your life and work here to support that.</p><p>We pay for the coffee, drink as much as you like. No powdered creamer or burned sludge. Blech.</p><p>We have nice new offices that we just moved into. Plenty of room and a nice space to spend your days.</p><p>We do our bet to make this a good place to work and spend your time. Give us a call or send us a note if you want to learn more.</p></div>
