		<div class="comment_text"><p>I want to add a quick comment about Burnout Paradise. I feel like I came down a bit hard on them. In the entire history of XBox 360, I do not think any game has ever provided as much free updates as BO Paradise. They added some huge changes/updates to the game that were 100% free. (They had paid DLC too.) They deserve some major credit for that.</p><p>Also, apparently, in their last DLC (not free though), they finally added restart. I'll still ding them for a poor design choice, but, it's been corrected at least.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The new xombie mode stuff in BO2 is pretty fun. It's the same as the MP, it's more fun and less frustrating with a group of friends.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gran Turismo consumed the majority of my life after college.</p><p>Since then COD and Halo have been my crack, but alas I have bought and sold and Xbox 3 times. My wife thinks I have a mistress named Ex Bocks. I'm more of PC player anyway and since I used a modified rig to play my Xbox with a mouse and keyboard it just made more sense.</p><p>However, on PC, friends I have none :(</p><p>My wife has seen my plight and has now resumed negotiations to purchase Xbox number IV. I think it's a trap, but I can't refuse the bait.</p><p>I really liked BO2 MP as well. I haven't been able to play Halo 4 because of previously mentioned situation. I hope to rejoin the ranks soon. I'm just tired of playing with myself :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Boo Blops 2. Tired of Treyarch crap. Zombies was the only thing I was looking forward to. Halo 4 is where it's at. I can understand the frustration on the power outage thing. They must have missed cats jumping on power cables during their testing sessions ;) The MP can be frustrating but it's fun and the Spartan Ops is great addition.</p></div>
