		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,</p><p>I am designer who is familiar with code but really struggle writing it myself. I loved your tutorial and I want to be able to integrate dynamic content into the design I do using Edge Animate. I was wondering, for those  of us beginners, would you consider doing a tutorial that shows how you could input lets say the weather from something like the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FWeather.com%3AmKnZBxxc1jUh_N2kCkZGRL0OXHI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Weather.com">Weather.com</a> API into an edge composition? Thanks so much for all your amazing work.</p><p>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, amazing timing! I actually just did a blog post on dynamically setting a style sheet based on weather. My plan was to do one for Edge Animate as well. However, it would be a bit different then what I think you mean. My plan was to blog on: "Based on X, load a Edge Animate animation." So it wouldn't change one animation per se, but decide which to load (ie, sunny versus stormy). Would that still be useful?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,</p><p>Thanks for the quick response. I guess whether its in Edge or in an HTML editor it shouldnt make too much of a difference...though its nice to keep it all in one program.</p><p>What would be cool would be to see how you could dynamically state today weather in both "Degrees" and also image. For instance, the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FWeather.com%3AmKnZBxxc1jUh_N2kCkZGRL0OXHI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Weather.com">Weather.com</a> App on iPad. It shows today temperature and if its snowing, raining, sunny, dark, etc.</p><p>They probably have an API where you could port in today weather, and based off of that number it could display an animated background that you created in Edge.</p><p>I would go further and say that any help you need on the creative front, I am happy to build for you in Edge. Like some animated clouds on a sunny day. or some raining drops on an overcast rainy day. let me know.</p><p>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My initial thinking was that I'd dynamically load an individual Edge Animation to save on page load size. So instead of loading N blocks of animation for N types of weather, you would check the weather and then load 1.</p><p>But - I can see how having 1 Animation with 'branching' logic in it could be useful. Keeping in mind I'm new to Edge Animate, I seem to remember that we can use Labels in the timeline and use custom code to "play" at a custom label.</p><p>So in theory, you could design a EA script with a few weather animations and labels, and then write custom code outside of EA to handle telling it with to launch.</p><p>What do you think? If you could design that, I could do the weather logic, and it would be a kick ass blog post.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In theory, it is easy. JavaScript has a string function to split data into an array (<a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FString%2Fsplit%29%3Atr49WjfT01vYku6W2_Ngvv4czbU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)">https://developer.mozilla.o...</a>. If you use that on your result from the AJAX call, you would have an array of strings. You then simply modify my code to use each item of the array.</p><p>Assume you did this into an array called parts and you expect 2 of them. Assume you made two text symbols. You could then do:</p><p> sym.$("Text").html(parts[0]);<br> sym.$("Text").html(parts[1]);</p><p>You could get fancier. You could have one text symbol that looked like this:</p><p>Hello, {name}. Happy {foo} day.</p><p>You could then use JS string functions to replace {name} with line 1 and {foo} with line 2.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Raymond - I saw the split command but could not get it to work.  I mainly use Delphi to code (and could easily do this using it) but am new to JS - what if the amount of lines was unknown? is there a way of reading the content of the file into an Array until the file is finished? ie EOF? - I have read a little on JS Arrays and they seem to be similar....I will work on it later tonight (I am in the UK) if you do have any other suggestions/pointers though, it would be appreciated.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"what if the amount of lines was unknown"<br>Why would it be? If your intent is to make two items (or 3, etc) in your animation dynamic based on some server-side resource, you have to make _some_ assumption, right? Now if you are tying your EA code to some other service - like - a remote weather service, that's something else entirely.</p><p>"s there a way of reading the content of the file into an Array until the file is finished? ie EOF? - "</p><p>Don't worry about that - your code (well mine above) is run when the network request is _done_, so you've gotten all the result at that point.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, there is slight confusion here - I personally am not creating the data, otherwise I would just add it all manually- my client/customer will be editing the file - therefore this has to be dynamically loaded from that file - and therefore I (personally) as the developer do not know what that number could be...which is why I would look at Arrays and then manipulating the array.....anyway I think I am going to go down the Json route now - allowing the data to be added to a database, and then creating the json file using php and displaying that within the animation seems to be the best way to do this.  Thanks for the suggestions though Pete</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting tutorial :). Is it possible to combine this with PHP and grab data from a MySQL table? I would be keen to try this out - I'm thinking that if I combine this idea with Ajax, I could get graphs (via Google Chart Tools) to "animate" when data is updated. Had I come across this sooner, I would have had a good starting solution for a project...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hello Raymond. Firstly, I appreciate your blog and insights. Adobe Edge Animate support is very minimal which means its hard to find comprehensive explanations to create intermediate projects. To let you have an idea of my skill set I have a background in animation and design and have been taking classes in web development. My question is about how to create an interactive website that loads various animation depending on the user's choice and current place within the Adobe Edge Animate timeline. The website I developed for a client @ <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goshowpro.com%3AjCRRI6Y5x66MLxicWP1mJMmrk5U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.goshowpro.com">www.goshowpro.com</a> works but loads slower than I want and doesn't format properly on my client's Macbook (I believe he needs to update his browsers but that is something else.)</p><p>So as you can see from looking at my website I used a multitude of HTML files to create my vision of an interactive website based off of a theatrical stage. I know this is not an ideal method.  I would prefer to have it all on one page but I am having trouble with my javascript coding. I was wondering if there would be away to expedite my current site's load time and if not if you could look at my NEW coding.</p><p>Below is a snippet of my coding for the portfolio link that I would like to implement on the site. This IS NOT the current coding on the site. Obviously I am using labels for my trigger. Additionally, my new project file is having issues with visual formating (things popping or doubling up when they shouldn't). Thank you in advance<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>if = "hstop" "chomstop" "shomstop" "phomstop"<br>{<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsym.play%3APtEwXAGBLYeoeo1-wdfUK9NHtcI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sym.play">sym.play</a>("hporstart")};<br>else = "hconstop" "sconstop" "pconstop" <br>{<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsym.play%3APtEwXAGBLYeoeo1-wdfUK9NHtcI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sym.play">sym.play</a>("cporstart")};<br>else = "hserstop" "cserstop" "pserstop"<br>{<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsym.play%3APtEwXAGBLYeoeo1-wdfUK9NHtcI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sym.play">sym.play</a>("sporstart")};<br> ----------------------------------------------</p><p>It looks crappy but I'm trying to learn so don't laugh too much.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Adobe Edge Animate support is very minimal " - just curious - but what avenues did you try? Did you try the forums? ( <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.com%2Fgo%2Flearn_animate_forum%29%3AOWg7k49z2GIZI9Be79gXMzao11U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://adobe.com/go/learn_animate_forum)">http://adobe.com/go/learn_a...</a> Let me know. Just want to make sure you are using all the available resources you can.</p><p>In terms of performance, I'm not sure I'm the best person to help you with Edge Animate and performance. I'm still learning myself. But I'll try.</p><p>First - I notice you have some rather large images. I'm not expert in image compression, but maybe you can lower the quality a bit or consider a lossy version. The largest asset is one I can't even see, BlackBackground.gif.</p><p>I'm a bit unsure about the last part of your comment. Are you saying you want to try that code or you did and you want to try it on the home page too? I'd definitely suggest something like that as the complete page reload is slow.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the post. I came across it while searching for the dynamic aspects of EA.</p><p>when I started my project I incorrectly assumed the 'stop at' command would stop when it reaches that point on the timeline. However once I realized it jumps directly there I couldn't find an easy way to play a section of the timeline ie play from point A to B where A is the current position and B is unknown.</p><p>So is there an easy way you know of to create a stop point on the fly that doesn't jump directly to it?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>the 'Stop At' is what its referred to in the snippet side panel, but yeah its the stop( [label or milliseconds]) command i was talking about.</p><p>Unless something is wrong with my program, i made a simple example by drawing a circle at 0 seconds (to make sure i knew the timeline was playing) and a square that wouldn't become visible until the ten second mark. Then I added a trigger on the timeline at 1 second: sym.stop(10000);</p><p>The circle appears, and then 1 second later the square appears meaning it skips to that point. While what I'd like to happen is to have it continue playing the other 9 seconds but once it reaches that  point to stop.</p><p>I have a very crude way of doing it now by setting triggers at over a 100 points and getting the position of each one, then an if statement to stop playing if it matches a dynamic variable. It works, but it takes forever to load the code window as I have 600 of these triggers so far, and would need about a thousand more for the other features I'm adding.</p><p>Any help or easier workaround would be much appreciated.<br>Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've spoken with the PM (product manager) and yes - stop(n) is meant to go to N and stop. I made it clear that I thought the docs were a bit unclear on this.</p><p>What about this alternative. If you know where you may want to stop, lets say positions A, B, and C, you add triggers for each.</p><p>Then your code does something like this:</p><p>if(somecondition) stopBFlag = true;</p><p>In your triggers for A, B, and C, you simply check these flags, and if true, you stop.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You would just change the JS code to point to the JSON file. If the file ends in .json, jQuery will automatically recognize it as JSON and parse it. Otherwise you use the 3rd (I believe) argument to $.get to tell it the type is JSON.</p></div>
