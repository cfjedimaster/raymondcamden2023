		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, Ray, kudos to you for the openness even after joining Adobe!  No sarcasm here; I really do just want to commend you for owning your blog and continuing to provide honest, open information on what we can (and should) all be doing with our beloved ColdFusion.  I've been using it since 1998 and it continues to rock out loud, but you bloggers who promote it to the world, to both old users and new, are the rockstars.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Jason</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I play the drums and the guitar (just about), I have long hair and a beard and when my 2 year old sees Dave Grohl on TV she says "daddy" :D</p><p>I am not a rock star, but any rock-like qualities I have, are ignored entirely when I start talking about code to anybody other than another coder.</p><p>You cannot talk about writing/hosting/maintaining code without being a dork/nerd/geek... it's a requirement. Otherwise how else could we get excited by functions, variables, configuration files and http status codes?</p><p>Also brave step on switching to CF10 straight away... shame you had to switch back Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Possibly. My machine doesn't have a lot of RAM - only because I'm cheap. Edgeweb provides me a good server for free, I pay a bit more for a bit more RAM, but I'd feel more comfortable with even MORE ram if I wanted to run both.</p></div>
