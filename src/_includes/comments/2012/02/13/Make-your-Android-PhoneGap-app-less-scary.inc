		<div class="comment_text"><p>Add the permissions that you really use.<br>Ray is right, your app could do everything if you got full permissions. Some Users don't care, some (including me) won't even think to press the "install" button.</p><p>If you need Internet, Camera, Network-States then add only these permissions. If you only need the WebView then you have to set declare android.permission.INTERNET. Since Phonegap opens up a WebView with your index.html, I think you have to include it in all your Apps.</p></div>
