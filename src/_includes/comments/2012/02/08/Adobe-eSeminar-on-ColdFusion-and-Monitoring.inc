		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the plus side, it's fairly (hah) inexpensive to lease the software annually.  I finally broke down and got a standard license for one of my VPS's, but it just wasn't playing nice with Resin.  When I shift over to Tomcat I'll spin it up again.  I love it, and when I last left my admin duties at EPA, almost all the servers had a license for keeping dibs on the state of your services.</p></div>
