		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was just talking about something like this to a student yesterday in a Sencha Touch class. Thanks for posting this as I was going to look into this after a project wraps up in a week or so. You run into any issues with the PhoneGap build process when using the included API require'd into the node app? The app size seem reasonable enough for mobile?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dave - I can't comment on any trouble using it as I just built it yesterday. I haven't used it in production at all.</p><p>As to your very last question - are you asking about the size of PG apps in general?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was wondering if including Node increased the size of the PhoneGap-base apps compared to others you may have built. Just curious.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Um - no - that is totally incorrect there. I hope I didn't confuse you.</p><p>I'm not including Node in my PhoneGap apps. Node is a server-side technology. You can't do server-side stuff in mobile apps. You can communicate with a server running Node, or CF of course, using Ajax, but you aren't "running" it in the PG app itself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool. Thanks for the clarification. There has been some chatter of trying to get Node apps to run client-side on devices, and upon a quick skim I though this was an interesting solution by "wrapping" it with PhoneGap for cross-platform use. My confusion. Using Node of the server-side is very cool and if you continue down the path I think you'll like what you find. Enjoy.</p></div>
