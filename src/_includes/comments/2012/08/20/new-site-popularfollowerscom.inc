		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond! It "was" awesome to work with you (notice the quotes, I somehow have the feeling we might work together again in the future). I want to add that we basically created this whole tool, from coding, designing, deciding on a name, registering a domain etc, within &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 24 HOURS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;. It took a bit longer before it was launched, but the first 80% of the work was completed within hours after my initial email to you :). It was a pleasure to work with you, and it was perhaps my most productive collab ever.</p><p>Kind regards from the Netherlands,</p><p>Amin</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow that's so cool. Do you think you could then use the UI of Narcissus with circles ?  <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riagora.com%2Fnarcissus%2F%3AVXo3Kqvl2ajveJIuLqRMGiBa29Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.riagora.com/narcissus/">http://www.riagora.com/narc...</a> How go you bypass twitter limitations ?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The second question is easier to answer. Since I'm using JS, the Twitter API is using *your* access, or rather your IP, to rate limit. So you still get blocked after a 100 or so hits. Not much I can do about that. At minimum it allows you to check your own followers and maybe a few others. I've got 4.4k or so and I can view mine like 3 times before I get limited. In theory I could add OAuth to it, but, meh, it seems good enough for testing for yourself. ;)</p><p>As for the Narcissus UI, don't you have this stat already? I think for this app, since it does one thing, the table makes the most sense. But I'm no UI expert. ;)</p></div>
