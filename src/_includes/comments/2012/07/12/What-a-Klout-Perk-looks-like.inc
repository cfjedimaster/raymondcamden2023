		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, if I can still remember my wine waiter days, I will try to tell you what they are.</p><p>The first one (starting on the left) is indeed a corkscrew and cap remover.<br>The one to the right is a bottle plug. If you are not familiar with that, it will keep your wine fresh for a few days. If it is a good bottle you won't need it.<br>As for the ring, I believe that it might be used with the bottle plug (might want to do some research on that).<br>The aerator is correct, although it is rather strange looking.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The ring goes over the neck of the bottle and soaks up any dribbles that may run down it after pouring.  Keeps your tablecloths from getting wine stains (unless you get wrecked and just knock over the whole bottle, in which case the ring will be ineffective).</p></div>
