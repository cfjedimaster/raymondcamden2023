		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, I three love Locke &amp; Key and I will second the recommendation for American Vampire. Like you I got out of comics for a long time and started picking them back up 7 or 8 years ago. In that time I've gradually moved away from reading super hero books as as you say they "never end". So now I find myself picking up a bunch of things like the aforementioned Locke &amp; Key, American Vampire along with:</p><p>Sweet Tooth by Jeff Lemire - a post apocalyptic world of human animal hybrids which is both touching and chilling at the same time. <br>Unwritten by Peter Carey - which really blurs the line between do we make up stories, are they given to us and what power do they hold.<br>Chew by John Layman - absolutely mental take on the world where avian flu means all chicken is banned and the main character is a cibiopath i.e. anything he eats he instantly knows everything it has come into contact with. Hard to explain but quite fun.<br>Morning Glories by Nick Spencer - which it those 80's teenager movies got crossed with slasher flicks and Lost type mystery.<br>Criminal by Ed Brubaker - film noir in comic book form</p><p>and finally if you missed it while it was being published the series Gotham Central by Brubaker, Rucka and Lark was amazing. It followed the cops of the Gotham City precinct as they tried to do their jobs with all the superheroes and villains getting in the way. Just a great book.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have read a few issues of Chew and it is fascinating. I never read comics as a kid (or young adult). I started reading them last year when DC did their 'reboot'. I have to admit, I have become quite smitten with Batman thanx to the reboot, but I find I enjoy stories like American Vampire &amp; Locke &amp; Key more.</p><p>Supercrooks &amp; Secret Service, from Mark Millar, are very good (though only 2 issues each so far). 'Chosen' an ongoing story also by Mark Millar had a first series named 'American Jesus' that was very good. 'Superior' (again by Millar) was fantastic - I honestly think if Mark Millar wrote it, I could enjoy reading the phone book.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't stress enough that if you haven't checked out Fables, you really should. The writing is fantastic and the artwork is solid. Otherwise I'm a huge comic nerd and could probably recommend about 1K things to read. Recently, I picked up Ronin by Frank Miller and that was a great story as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 to American Vampire. It isn't on my pull list - but I've read some.</p><p>+Sweet Tooth: Sounds fascinating!</p><p>+Ryan: I was considering mentioning Ultimates. I discovered the series around the same time as I got back into comics in general. I found it pretty cool (the entire line) and was considering picking up one of them monthly, but I just couldn't commit to any.</p><p>+Millar: Yeah, everything I've read by him is damn good.</p><p>+Fables: I read about 60 issues - and liked it - but never got around to catching up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My iPad and my wallet are still recovering after I found comixology.  I really like that I don't have to store my comics any more, well, most of them.  I still buy Marvel in paper format as $3.99 6 months after they've stopped selling it on newsstands seems a little steep to me...especially when DC discounts to $1.99 after a month.</p><p>Check out 2000AD if you get a chance (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2F2000adonline.com%3Ao6Lc2IN_zNkiKixjeMHE4gD04LQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="2000adonline.com">2000adonline.com</a>) (UK comic)  They've started selling their comics in digital format and loads of great writers and artists.  Where most of the "British comic invasion" came from :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I also recommend Y: The Last Man by Brian Vaughn, it's a great stand alone series of 60 issues.</p><p>Hellboy &amp; BPRD both continue to be two of my favorite comic series year after year. I think it's partly because I enjoy a lot of Mike Mignola's horror influences that he brings to both series. Both series have a number of great short stories as well as well as Mignola does some interesting things long term over the series with some great characters.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As has been mentioned, Hellboy and BPRD are great reads.</p><p>On a less gritty note, I only recently discovered Atomic Robo, which is just plain fun. Comixology has several issues for free (mostly FCBD issues).</p><p>I also highly recommend Terry Moore's stuff. Echo was great and is fully collected in TPB now, I believe, and Strangers in Paradise was one of my wife's favorite comics other than Bone (also a great read if you haven't tried it yet). He has a new series out, Rachel Rising, that I haven't had a chance to look into yet.</p><p>And for the funny animal/gorgeous art/ladies itch, you can check out Liberty Meadows (Frank Cho's baby). I don't know if it's still being released, but the collections are available on Amazon</p></div>
