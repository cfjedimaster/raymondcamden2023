		<div class="comment_text"><p>Perhaps the fact that I am unable to run the preso suggests that I'm too stupid to understand it anyway, but I can't seem to get it fired off.  I load index.html and all I see are thumbnails of your first three or so slides and no way to navigate unless I manually edit the hashtag in the address bar.  Is there some trick I'm missing?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The slides were tested in Chrome - can you try that? And you use the keyword (left arrow, right arrow) to navigate).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Perfect.  Arrows scroll through the slides horizontally.  I was trying to mouse through it.  Thank you, sir.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The HTML based slides were an experiment. I probably won't do it again in the future. It's cool, but I prefer Powerpoint/Keynote, and I like being able to export a simple PDF.</p></div>
