		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray... I just downloaded the latest version and tried it out. I see they did some work on the Find Dialog (ColdFusion Search) and fixed some major bugs that prevented me from upgrading. However, it really bums me out that the Find Dialog is re-centered in my workspace each time I select some text and hit CTL-F. Who keeps the Find Dialog front and center? I usually move it to the side and do my work. This is killing me!! Does this happen in your world? I'm using Win7 x64. Why can't they get something so simple and core to editing to work correctly.</p></div>

It's *such* a PitA.  Unfortunately Adobe didn't seem to think it mattered.  I guess this might be because their engineers don't use CFB, they use vanilla Eclipse (I'd assume), and vanilla Eclipse does it right.</p><p>-- <br>Adam</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Let's be fair, Adam. I think the engineers would like to correct each and every issue and support each and every feature request. There simply isn't enough time. Just because an issue you care about is not addressed, it does not imply they don't care. Yes - I'm expected to back up my coworkers, but it's honestly how I feel. Shoot, there was at least one bug in CF9 that I cared about that didn't get addressed due to time issues. Do I think they don't care about me? Nope.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Adam... that original bug was the one I created back when I first evaluated CFB2. But because it was closed, I thought I needed to create a new one. I can't re-open the bug, nor can I vote on it, so I figured by creating a new bug I would draw attention to this (in my opinion) HUGE usability problem. I use CTL-F all day long, and I think most editors got this right back in 1990. It makes me not want to spend the money to upgrade and it makes me somewhat embarrassed to say that I'm a CF developer (amongst my .NET peers)! I guess I feel pretty strongly about this issue!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm getting the same message as Eric on the same platform except with CF 10 developer edition.  Seems there is an issue with InstallAnywhere.  I tried closing out of everything, re-downloading it, and making sure it was running as admin, but nothing seems to work, and chose different locations.  It gets to 100% and then displays the message. Oh well, I think I have my CF8 installer lying around here somewhere.  I'll wait until Adobe gets the bugs ironed out before I try again.</p></div>
