		<div class="comment_text"><p>I do not totally agree with your comment about checking folders for existence. Sure, you have to do this, but not every time you write something to that folder. You can check these things on initialisation of your application, not every time when a user uploads something (that's what try/catch is for).<br>This may be something of personal taste, but in my opinion not checking every time you upload something adds to the performance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, Thanks a lot for organising this contest and for the review of my entry!</p><p>JorritJ, Ray, checking every time is indeed a bit overkill. I'll go for a sollution that will hopefully please the both of you. I'll check the existens on application start. ;)</p><p>I've got some more idea's on how to improve this little demo application. I'll do that once the contest is over and I'm back from holidays! :)</p></div>
