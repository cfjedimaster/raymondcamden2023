		<div class="comment_text"><p>To my understanding...</p><p>1) There is no limit outside of the 'practical' limit of memory. So in one CFM file, you could make a million different variables. Nothing in the language prevents that. But eventually you run out of RAM.</p><p>2) As far as I know, there is no expiration, if you sit there with your browser open forever it should last forever.</p></div>
