		<div class="comment_text"><p>This year was my first at CFO and I have to say, it was the best conference I've ever attended. Coming from the BeHance conference a week and change earlier it kind of stunned me at first how much more directly injectable and relevant the content was. Elliot's talks were worth the price of admission alone. Seems like Angular is the biggest thing to happen to web interfaces since jQuery, and it's just getting started. Can't wait to get home and screw around with all of the great new stuff I learned. I can't not recommend this conference.</p></div>
