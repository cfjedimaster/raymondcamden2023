You know CF will always have a special place in my heart but staying up with the cool new web dev tools is so important.</p><p>You did that really nice with techs like jQuery, JavaScript &amp; PhoneGap so it's great to see you continuing on that forward pace with Node.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Is Node something that I could use to completely replace Coldfusion &amp; Apache (or PHP or any server side language), is it something that's going to work well alongside it, will Coldfusion be better than Node in some cases and vice versa?"</p><p>Node *can* replace CF. To be clear, it doesn't do everything CF does out of the box. What I mean is - you can do the same types of things. So for example, I'd say the same for PHP, Ruby, etc. All of these server-side things can "replace" CF. Whether it makes sense to or not is another matter. I'm using Node because I want to learn something new.</p><p>Can it work *with* CF? Absolutely. As an example, if you do not have CF10 and want to work with web sockets, you can easily build a web socket system in Node and call it from CF.</p><p>"I'm also fearful that if I love Node I'll not want to use CF again, and then I'll have wasted years of learning Coldfusion - that may be part of my reason for holding back. "</p><p>Pardon how rough this sounds, but that is stupid! :)  You should *never* feel like it is a waste to learn something! *All* technologies tend to rise and wane. CF will not be around forever. Neither will Node. But the more you know, the more you grow. (And have better job security.) I've also found that learning more about other programming languages leads to me being better at my existing languages. Many times you see how one language does something and you can apply it to your current language.</p></div>
