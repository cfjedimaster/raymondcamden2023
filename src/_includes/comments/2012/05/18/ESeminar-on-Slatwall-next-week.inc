		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, as far as I know, none of the e-seminars (and there are more than just CF ones) are 'broadcast' out.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This question came up in a private meeting last week and it relates to spam issues. Adobe _can't_ email anyone unless you've registered and _specifically_ said that you were ok with communications. Apparently we did send out quite a few emails, but if you didn't meet that criteria, you would not have gotten anything. Apparently the rules on emails are -very- strict.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ray: I just double checked my settings under 'My Adobe' and I have checks for sending me info to e-mail, postal mail and telephone. I have third-party permissions set to No and I have subscribed to Adobe Inspire Magazine. I also checked and all of our orders for ColdFusion and other products are also assigned to that ID. I know this is not your area at Adobe but perhaps they have something wrong with the mailer if both Alan and I are not getting any emails in regards to CF 10. Or maybe they just haven't sent anything out yet. Just trying to do my part to make sure everyone gets the good word about CF 10.</p></div>
