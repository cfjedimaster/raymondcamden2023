		<div class="comment_text"><p>Question: Did you chose Might/Sorcery over Finesse because the gameplay was more fitting with that style? I've found in Skyrim that playing a near-silent Bow Weilding Super Assassin is the way to go. Avoiding all direct fighting etc.</p><p>Thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I chose that style because it worked so well in Skyrim. I use magic to soften them up and for small heals, and then just swing like crazy.</p><p>One thing I didn't like is that you could only have 4 abilities mapped at once. At the level I'm at now I've got a few abilities I can't use just because you are limited to 4 slots.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm with you Ray, Kingdoms of Amalur is one of my new favorite things. The Legend of Dead Kel, downloadable content, was probably the most fun I've had in an RPG in the last decade.</p><p>The developers didn't stop developing at the end of the story arch either. They have a ton of post-victory quests that kept me coming back for more.</p><p>As for play style, I really like the dodge aspect of combat. I started off with martial and ended up going all finesse. The sneak attack/back-stab slow-motion movies are so much fun.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>David - good point on the combat. I didn't talk that up enough. I like how - even though I'm an incredible bad ass - I can still be overwhelmed. It's both frustrating and cool at the same time. I'll have some creature quickly attack, knock me back, and make me mad as hell. :)</p></div>
