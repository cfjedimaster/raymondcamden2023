		<div class="comment_text"><p>@David - There are some who believe that you shouldn't comment your code. The thought is that well-written code is self-explanatory, and that if you feel the need to comment it, that's along the lines of saying, "I realize this isn't as good as it should be..."</p><p>See <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbutunclebob.com%2FArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode%3A0nIJOlk-sec8TBdWcAy5dtwiiro&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode">http://butunclebob.com/Arti...</a></p><p>That being said, I wrote some code comments just yesterday. It was in a godawful overly-long function and yes, it was bad :)</p><p>In any event, just wanted to offer up an alternative perspective to the notion that code should be commented "effectively".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would ask to take a look at some of the code honestly. I have been in too many places in my past that once I accepted the job and looked at the code I was being asked to maintain, I thought, "Oh my God, what did I get myself into?"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Teams that practice 'ego-less programming' can be great to work in. The idea being that no-one owns the code, the team does. When there is bad code, it is the teams bad code; when there is good code, it is the team's good code. One symptom of this is practicing pair programming and also peer reviews (as opposed to line-manager reviews) where programmers actively seek review from their peers.</p><p>Perhaps asking how code is reviewed might be a good lead in to find out more about the team.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ Dominic Watson<br>I agree that "ego-less" teams are a lot of fun to work on. However, they don't appear to be the norm. In fact, the opposite seems to be (the norm). I have worked with far more programmers who think sharing knowledge with teamates lowers their job security. I want Team guys/gals around me, not the soloist!</p><p>@ Jim Priest<br>Unfortunately, I have seen more of the dreaded SILO approach than a true team approach.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Do programmers have quiet working conditions?" - I listen to quite a lot of loud music when I write code... on rare occasions I need it quiet, but generally I can't work in the quiet, I need to sing and drum on the desk when I code.</p><p>"Do you use the best tools money can buy?" - There are lots of free and open source tools out there, so I suppose he's not wrong but it's not all about money.</p><p>I agree with most of his points but Microsoft running on 12 points isn't a good selling point. Look at Internet Explorer and Windows Vista.</p></div>
