		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>The blog-title is a little mis-leading. A "Scripting Language" is defined on WikiPedia as:</p><p>"A scripting language is usually interpreted from source code or bytecode.[2] By contrast, the software environment the scripts are written for is typically written in a compiled language and distributed in machine code form; the user may not have access to its source code, let alone be able to modify it."</p><p>For clairty, I wouldn't confuse CFScript with a Scripting language. While CF is a scripting-language, the two definitions are very different things.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FScripting_language%3ATRBhc5MbfBSeyZKTBn55WSM1dV0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Phillip. I think a lot of my love for script came from JavaScript. For me I was tired of writing so much code for functions and arguments in tag based components. I also have a little bit of a Java background so writing components in script just came natural. If there is anything specific you guys want to see I could start writing a new series on moving over to script. I have been looking for something to blog about anyways :) Just let me know.</p></div>

Coming up with a valid example would be helpful.<br>Not that I want to encourage just writing about the latest tag/technique. <br>I toyed with some sort of rating system a while back: which tags were considered essential down to "do not use".  In my cfmeetup talk, someone offered the idea of crowd sourcing which tags were used the most in an effort to prioritize their learning.  We all have precious few minutes per day to learn something new, so if you're new to a topic, it would be nice to see what the community has found to be essential, advanced, and not useful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I prefer to write in cfscript. I recommend moving to CF9 not only because cfcript has gotten a lot better, but also because CFCs are easier to write in CF9 due to the enhancements in how to declare variables.</p><p>I've written a few CFCs entirely in cfscript, but sometimes I end up getting stuck wanting to call a module or do something that can't be done in cfscript, in which case I write my cfc as a hybrid of cfscript and cftags, which seems to work fine. The cfc shell is in cftag, and then inside the component, I create a cfscript block that has methods written in cfscript.</p><p>As a side note in working with javascript/cfscript: When I go back and forth between the two languages, the one thing that I always mess up is the difference between javascript operators (&gt; &lt; &lt;= &gt;= !=) and CF operators (GT LT LTE GTE NEQ), as well as the lack of ++ and --. I really hope CF handles these operators in cfscript someday!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John, you're in luck, Coldfusion handles those operators right now. Otherwise I agree with what you're saying. My suggestions for learning cfscript are to find some tag based code that you've written and understand really well and translate it to cfscript. At first keep the overall structure of the cfcs in tags and use cfscript tags to wrap the code within each function. There are certain tags like cfquery where the current implementation is problematatic and you want to be able to avoid frustration with them at first.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Everyone,<br>thanks for your initial posts, and Ray thanks for blogging about this. <br>Dan Vega, if you are looking for stuff to blog about, a couple post about the best way to transition from tag based CFC's to script based would be awesome...Finding out the Koans have cfscript is helpful as well. <br>I am not really sure how to approach showing my coworkers that cfscript is becoming more of a standard for cfc work, plus a lot of our cfc's are already in script so we are mixing both tags and script. Not saying this is bad, but i'd like to educate everyone so they at least can see the benefits of cfscript, and maybe we can even get our code more consistent.<br>So, I'll be checking the Koans, looking to see if we have a CFWACK book, and waiting to read some blogs from Dan about cfscript and the cleveland sports scene :)</p><p>thanks everyone and any more suggestions about how to teach cfscripting to people would be very helpful.</p><p>dan</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You definitely want to work very hard at eliminating tags from your programming "vocabulary" and transition into script. It's really an important key into having a continuous career without being tagged or labeled (scarred??) as a CFML developer. The tags do you know good other than to increase the number of keys you have to type when programming.  Plus, it reduces the amount of time it will take you to get up to speed on another language like PHP or Java, which is very important.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jorgen - I'm not sure I'd agree with eliminating tags. Have you done layout in script? It's a pain in the rear. Heck, even in JavaScript you have multiple templating options. I think tags work GREAT for layout and html and I'll always use them. For business logic though scripting is a lot more efficient.</p><p>No one tool fits all!</p></div>

I use script 100% of the time now for my business logic. For generating dynamic views, I use tags, because it makes me more productive. My HTML isn't static. Even with business logic in the model layer, you still have to build HTML dynamically at times and tags work best for me there.</p><p>Again, see the _multiple_ JavaScript frameworks that support this.

As as for being a sheep, i think a lot of people would be offended by that comment, there are many developers out there in this and all programming communities that have their own ideas and do things differently, no matter what Ray says :)<br>So, if you are not going to offer me any assistance, please  let others do so...</p><p>thanks<br>Dan</p></div>

I'd rather have plain ol variables sent to my views.  If an API changes, I'd rather not have to go into each view to make changes either.  This is especially evident with the different representations, e.g. xml, json, html....If we want to change the way a name is displayed, it would require each view be changed.  If we define that in the controller or a presenter object, it's only 1 place we need to change it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Scott:  In essence instead of your User object being passed to the view, a UserPresenter object would be passed.  The UserPresenter object would have variables/methods like formatted_username which would respond back with "lastname, firstname" or user_categories which would give you a list of categories that a user belongs to (2 different objects being referenced), or even user_categories_as_select which would return an html select tag.</p><p>Your views would only refer to objects inside the presenter object.  The presenter object only cares about how stuff is displayed.  The model never has to worry about how it's being displayed.</p><p>Now, don't get me wrong....I don't do this all the time.  I have been starting down this road.  I'm really trying to decouple my views from my models all together as I go forward.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the problem is the original example was too trivial.  How do you handle a form where a user can have multiple categories assigned to them?  Do you send both the user &amp; categories to the view and construct the select list there with logic to highlight the categories they already belong to?</p><p>Also, does a formatted_name method belong in your user object?  Or should it be done in the view?  This is where I find Presenters to be helpful.</p><p>All abstraction is only for the sake of abstraction until that abstraction is truly needed.  There are times when a cfquery on the top of the page is perfectly fine.  As the app grows bigger, that query may have to be moved to a business object.  Some people start by putting it in a business object to begin with.  Other people would think it's "abstraction for abstractions sake"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would likely have 'categories' as a property of user, so I could call user.getCategories() to get the categories. As for creating form for them, yes, I would need to send a list of available categories to the view and work some kind of logic to determine which ones are selected or checked in the form.</p><p>But, that is not 'business logic' so much as it is 'view logic' - two entirely different beasts.</p><p>I kind of see your point about about formattedName (sorry, I loathe _ in variable/function names - it reminds me of PHP or, worse, Oracle). However, I tend look at objects as if they are real. I would expect that if I asked a user their full name, they would be able to put their first and last name together and respond accordingly. If I was using a presenter object, I would need to ask the presenter for the user's full name, the presenter would need to ask the user for its first and last name, the user would need to tell the presenter their first and last name and then the presenter would put them together and then respond accordingly.</p><p>Presenter objects seem intriguing to me, but they seem like more of an extension of the view (or of the model) and is doing work that the model should be (or the view should be if you see the presentation object as an extension of the model). Can't seem to wrap my brain around the advantage they bring to the table.</p><p>Lastly, even using a presentation object, you still need tags to output anything you may retrieve form it - pretty much nullifying Jorgen's 'If you use tags, you are wrong' comment earlier.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just thought I'd jump in on this discussion and add my $.02 (probably not actually worth that, however.)</p><p>I did not take CS or MIS classes in college.  While I have always been a techy computer nerd kind of person (I wrote programs in Apple Integer BASIC in the early 80's,) I was put off by the hard core, full blown programming languages, and wanted nothing to do with a career where I would spend hours wrestling with hard to read, arcane code.</p><p>My introduction to CF came as a result of my familiarity with HTML and JavaScript circa about the year 2000. Having seen and avoided the tangle of syntactical crap that was PERL, CF was absolutely "the right answer" to me. The transition was very easy as a result of the tag based syntax, and despite what the haters said, rarely was (or is) there anything I needed to that I couldn't using CF.</p><p>Fast forward to today. I am a CF application developer. Even though I write plenty of JavaScript and jQuery, I still prefer using tag based CF for most of my day-to-day CF work. (I think it is easier to read, and for other folks who follow behind me to understand.) That said, I think this debate about using tags versus CFSCRIPT is like arguing over which color hammer works the best, and is ultimately pointless and unnecessary.</p><p>Despite their lack of ability to aggressively market CF, Adobe has gone to great lengths to make the product incredibly flexible and usable by almost anyone from ANY programming background (from literally NO programming experience whatsoever, to uber geeks that can do trigonometric math in octal in their head.)</p><p>The introduction of CFSCRIPT, CFCs, ORM,, etc., are all  wonderful ways to bring in folks who ALREADY think and program that way (based on whatever "best practice" is the flavor of the month,) and can help expand the horizons of folks (like me) whose experience has been pretty much limited to HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, XML, and CF.</p><p>The many different ways you can program in CF are not inherently "right" or "wrong".  To be Zen, they simply "are." Granted there is good code and bad code, but let's try to keep our eye on the bigger picture: CF is a fantastic tool, and the fact that it is so incredibly flexible is an absolute plus! We should be collectively celebrating that and spreading the word, and not getting preachy, pedantic or self-righteous about any one way to use it over another.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We had almost the same problem here. Millions of tag-based code and a new small project I developed 100% in script to learn and understand it. Awesome. Except for queries (script-based querying in CF is somewhat weird) the rest of the code was easy to learn, type, debug and visualize. After breaking this first barrier, the entire team started to love scripting. Now we do maintenance in tags, but everything that's new we're using scripts because we believe its the future, its similar to other languages we use like JS and its better. But we only started to use it when we've found good color-coding in Eclipse.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Jim, you can avoid those collisions if you specify the full component path for the built in script objects, so "new com.adobe.coldfusion.http();" instead of "new http();".  A bit more to type, and less portable, but it works and makes sure it doesn't find another http.cfc.</p></div>
