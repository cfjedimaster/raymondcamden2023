		<div class="comment_text"><p>Are those topics mostly final?</p><p>To be honest, the events sound like a rather bland straight-forward CF10 promotion event so far. Something Adobe usually promotes through the local CFUGs (e.g., back when they were promoting CF9) rather than using a larger event's name.</p><p>Not sure if London will have anything to make up for that, but I would have rather spent money on a full-blown conference event, where Adobe simply gets a couple of prime session slots because they're a major sponsor that year.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The traveling events don't seem to have a price attached, but most Adobe promotion events in cooperation with UGs usually don't.</p><p>What I meant is how the name of a larger conference seems rather out of place when used with something like that, especially because of what the name would usually imply.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So you think this is not worthy of the name? I don't know. Obviously permission was given. At the end of the day - I hope these events are useful to people. I don't imagine they will appeal to _everyone_ though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For many different reasons Fuzzy Orange could not have organized a full Scotch On The Rocks conference as planned in March 2012 (believe it or not but they actually do work on projects for customers :-)  ).</p><p>When Adobe decided to launch a ColdFusion tour in Europe in May (to follow cfObjective conference in Minneapolis), we immediately offered Andy's team to join and co-organize the tour so the community could, in the end, have a small taste of Scotch during the first 2012 semester while waiting for the full conference they are already working on for later in the year.</p><p>Conclusion : yes, this is an Adobe ColdFusion tour, organized together with Scotch On The Rocks to bring the conference back on the road just like we did in 2009.</p><p>What is important ?  We'll have Charlie Arehart, Andy Allan, Hugo Sombreireiro, Hemant Khandelwal, Sven Ramuschkat, Steven Peeters, Cyril Hanquez, Guust Nieuwenhuis and Reto Aeberli speaking on the tour.  That's an awesome line of speakers.</p><p>One last thing about London : as much as would have loved to have it ready yet, the olympics in London, combined with logistics issues we have, make it impossible to give more details for now.  But we are working hard on getting things done very quickly.</p></div>
