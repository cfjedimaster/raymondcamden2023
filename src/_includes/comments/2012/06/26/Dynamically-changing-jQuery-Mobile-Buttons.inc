		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for this post.  I notice in your demo that the button you are clicking on (either one) does not get the theme change, except for theme 'e' (I have no idea why just 'e' works).  I imagine this is because of the associated events that are repainting the button back to the default theme.  It would be super if you could find a way to make it work!  Thanks.</p></div>
