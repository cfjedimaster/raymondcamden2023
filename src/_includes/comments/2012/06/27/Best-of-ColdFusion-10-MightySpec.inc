		<div class="comment_text"><p>BDD is immense, and I was thrilled to see Marc working on this. There are three reasons why this rocks:</p><p>1 - ANY addition to testing strategies and resources is a great thing<br>2 - BDD means it can be readable by non-developers... everyone can see what should be happening in the tests<br>3 - it highlights how awesome CF10 features are!</p><p>Great work, Marc!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This may sound nerdy - but one of the main things I miss since my move to evangelism is writing unit tests. As I hardly do anything more than POCs for blog entries and books, I just don't find the need to write UTs as part of my day to day. Seeing this makes me want to find an excuse. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, good point. I should at least get into Jasmine now and see how well it works with PhoneGap projects. Obviously it can't test hardware, but it could handle the rest.</p></div>
