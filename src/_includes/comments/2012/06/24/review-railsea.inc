Got about 4 chapters into Perdido Street Station and lost interest. I'll give it another go later.</p><p>Ready Player One was excellent though. One of the only books I've ever wanted to reread immediately after finishing it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is it a coincidence that I initially read his last name as "Melville"?  Or did I unconsciously scan ahead to the words "Moby Dick"?</p><p>Anyway, sounds interesting.  I hadn't heard of China Mieville before. I just added Perdido Street Station to my reading list.  Good place to start?  It's his most popular book on Goodreads.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure I'd recommend Perdido as his first book. It is incredible, but a bit daunting. I'd maybe recommend the The City and the City. It is an _incredible_ mind f###, but also approachable.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read Moby Dick. The narrative parts (which are quite good) are surrounded by informational parts that will tell you more about whales and whaling than you ever wanted to know.</p><p>I still need to get around to reading a China Mieville novel one of these days. Way too much to read, not nearly enough time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@F.E.: I think that the (very dated) natural science that is framed within Moby Dick is an important part of the experience of reading it - this helps to set your mind into the time when the writer and his readers moved narrative and background information in this way. On the other hand, I know several folks who re-read Moby Dick from time to time, and admit to scanning through the whaling exposition on their repeat visits.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just thought I would throw in 2cents for RPO (Ready Player One)  Fantastic book for us children of the 80's.   Even better if you know Middletown OH.  Joust will never be the same.</p></div>
