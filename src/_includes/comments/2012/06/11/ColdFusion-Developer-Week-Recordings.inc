		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, Just started with the recordings as I've just got back frmo a couple of weeks in America, but I've one question I'd like to ask, which is about migrating from Coldfusion 8 to 10 on a Windows 2008 production server.</p><p>Is there anything I should be aware of when doing this? It's sort of putting me off in case something goes catastrophically wrong!</p><p>All the best, Garry</p><p>Cheers</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think you have much to worry about. In general, CF is -very- backwards compat. Obviously you want to test. You can also use the Code Analyzer in the CF Admin to scan for issues.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've already run my code through the code analyser and that's fine, it's the actual installation that I'm concerned about Ray.</p><p>On my dev machine I lost all datasources and scheduled tasks, but I uninstalled CF8 before putting 10 on, I guess a straight over the top install will be fine.</p></div>
