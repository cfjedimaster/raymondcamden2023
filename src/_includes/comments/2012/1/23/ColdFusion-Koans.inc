		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's an interesting journey Grant took and one that others, I'm sure, had taken too. I'm glad he got to the bottom of the issue and made his self-discovery. It's a lot to own up to in public, especially the really bad practices. Good for him. It must be like coming out of a rehab clinic as a new man! ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is interesting that he's had so much of a struggle in the past and can own up to his own challenges and vow to do something about it. The fact that he has a year long agenda tells me that he's going to be successful in growing his skills. The interesting thing is that he's going back to CF.  Nothing wrong with that, it's just that if he really wanted to have the ultimate educational experience, he'd want to surround himself with people who live and breath best practices, which unfortunately isn't really the CF way.  Not to mention he'd be much more hirable on another platform.  He was looking at Ruby... he should compare the number of Ruby jobs to CF jobs and see for himself.  I wish him luck though and like I said, his words alone make me thing he'll be in good shape really soon.</p></div>

I take strong objection with that. I certainly think you are right about the benefit of learning something new. That's definitely recommended, but you basically just said that no one using CF does things the best way. I know _plenty_ of CF developers who follow best practices. Am I misunderstanding your comment?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Paul, I noticed you also left an anti-CF comment here too (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raymondcamden.com%2Findex.cfm%2F2012%2F1%2F18%2FQuick-tip--using-cfthrow-as-a-reminder%29%3Ad-CJe2FrVXbEi-LQzEBcT4_un5Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/1/18/Quick-tip--using-cfthrow-as-a-reminder)">http://www.raymondcamden.co...</a>. I responded to you there and you did not comment back. That leads me to believe you may be simply trying to troll here. Is that the case? Maybe you didn't see my reply. I'm definitely open to debate here.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not trying to cause a rift here and I know that you and your blog are highly regarded, but I hardly think that my commentary counts as trolling or reflects anti CF sentiment.  I believe the community would be much better off to embrace suggestions to learn from others/other platforms to make their work better all around, regardless of the platform they choose.  I know a member of the Python community who had his head bitten off when he suggested to a group of CFers that they put business logic in CFCs instead of embedding it in procedural code.  It was ugly and uncalled for, IMO.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, so to be clear, I agree w/ you about learning another language. Did you not see the -very- specific portion I quoted you on where you _seemed_ to imply CF can't do best practices? If that's not your intent, fine, but if it is, I'd like you back up your statement.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No, I'm not saying CF is not capable of best practices.  I'm saying that CF projects will most likely not consist of best practices.  Honestly, most "senior CF developers" have that title because they've been working for a long time, not because they employ best practices or develop in what most consider "senior level".  Maybe you and those you work with are the exception to this, but it's most commonly the case in CF.  Surely in your experience you've found that to be true.  Is Grant really unique in his story?  I don't think he is and he should take comfort in that.  However, he should also work hard to break free of his current boundaries, and other platforms and communities are a really good way to do that.  Believe me, I do CF in addition to other platforms and it's very enlightening.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Grant's post was a big inspiration for me this year, and I'm doing something similar to him in setting specific goals for the year (although my plan is not nearly so CF-exclusive).</p><p>RE: ColdFusion Koans, I'm interested to see people's opinion of these as a learning tool. I've been working through Ruby Koans, and I've found it quite helpful in getting acquainted with the fundamentals. Based on that, I'm try to evaluate whether or not CF Koans would be a useful thing to provide for new developers on our team.</p><p>Has anyone used these in a team environment to accentuate training for new developers, and if so, what has been the outcome?</p></div>
