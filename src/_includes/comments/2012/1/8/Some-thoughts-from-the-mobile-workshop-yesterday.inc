		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think your perspective on the "definition" of HTML5 is spot on. Thinking in terms of "next gen web" rather than "precise specification document" is a lot more helpful way to talk about what's coming (and is here), rather than constantly having to qualify whether this or that feature is or isn't part of the HTML5 spec.</p><p>I also totally agree about the unfortunate short shrift that some seriously cool aspects of HTML5 get. If HTML5 was *only* geolocation and web storage, I think I would be completely satisfied. Canvas is, of course, cool, but not _that_ cool :)</p></div>
