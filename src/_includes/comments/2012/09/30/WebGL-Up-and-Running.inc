		<div class="comment_text"><p>I looked into WebGL about a year ago, so my info may be well out of date.  But one looke at the 200+ lines of code (much involving shaders) just to get a triangle up on the screen as a sort of Hello World and I could tell that WebGL was a language to be used by libraries and compilers, not directly by humans.  You may as well be coding in Assembler again.</p><p>Sadly, it almost makes me long for the days of VRML.  At least that was nice and declarative, had primitives, and a sensible lighting model.</p><p>Having said all of that, I look forward to seeing what the abstraction libraries sitting on top of WebGL will be able to do.</p></div>
