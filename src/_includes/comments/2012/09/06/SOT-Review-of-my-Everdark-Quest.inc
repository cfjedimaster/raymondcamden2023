		<div class="comment_text"><p>I fondly remember being eaten by a Grue.  Dungeons was a wonderful RPG that I ran on my PDP-11 (under RSTS/E)  I recall we would log in from home at 1200 baud &amp; spend literally days playing.  I obtained a Fortran source for the game and was intrigued by the author's ability to take a concept and turn it into code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>p.s. Best text game ever? Easy - "Trinity"</p><p>Btw, people still write text adventures. See <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wurb.com%2Fif%2F%3AyuDboEGAhZCMemOV-uIUWMimNU4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.wurb.com/if/">http://www.wurb.com/if/</a></p><p>There are freeware toolkits you can download to write and compile your own. One of the languages called Inform 7, is a strange and wonderful thing using nearly normal English syntax.</p><p>Example: [code]    <br>The Patio is a room. The Patio contains a grill and an ice chest. The ice chest contains a cold beer. On the grill are a steak and a hot dog.</p><p>    Mom is a woman in the Patio.</p><p>    Instead of taking something which is on the grill:<br>        say "'Hey, you'll burn yourself,' says Mom." <br>[/code]</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm, I'd argue that AMFV had a better story, but Trinity is damn good too, and also something far and above what you would see today. (In terms of storytelling, not technology of course.)</p><p>Yep, aware, of the modern text-based games, and had heard of Inform 7, but had never actually seen the syntax. That is damn slick!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It makes sense.   There are some people that go to far with it but definitely a LOT of people that blow things way out of proportion which is sad.<br>BTW my name is a male name which is why I started the attempt at humor there.  I thought you remembered since we have spoken a few times.  Although it was by email so I guess it's a bit tough to tell that way.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Long live Everdark!  Best PvP system ever and very fun.  I was thinking what would it take to do a modern 3D version of this game as it has everything.  Quests, housing, pvp, unique classes, house system, cool items... the good old days.<br>I still feel bad for "accidentally" killing King Winter and taking everyone's tax money for the year before he deposited it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, so this is VERY late, but I may as well. I played Darien on ED back around 2000 for a couple of years. Great game and I really miss it. I was studying when the urge to Google "Everdark Wormwood" entered and the first thing I saw was this blog. Just thought it was neat, and seeing Bax and Pug in the comments! Wow ...</p></div>
