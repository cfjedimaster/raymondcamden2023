		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, it really bugged me when this changed (when iOS5 was released). The specific problem in our case was credit card numbers which could quite validly start with a 0.</p><p>I do wonder if other patterns unlock different keyboards as well - ie email, url</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I tried some more examples, but nothing else seemed special like this. Interestingly enough, when I did [0-5]*, it didn't use the numeric keyboard. I bet you it is *just* for 0-9.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A pet peeve of mine are web forms that enforce, particularly, numeric validation on zip codes and phone numbers, making it impossible for folks outside of the US to register to vote, renew their drivers license, order a birth certificate, buy stuff online, etc. Zip codes and phone numbers are text, period, of an undetermined length. You never have to do mathematical operations on them, so validating them as numerical is not necessary, and only prevents some folks from entering their VALID phone number or zip code - the one they can be contacted with!</p></div>
