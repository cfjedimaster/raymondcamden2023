		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Christopher, I think it depends on the logic. If you are in development, then the throwing of an error is good reminder. Personally I tend to use the TODO in comments because CFB keeps track of these.</p><p>But I will say that I have done this, when doing large coding and working on many different things. But with this and unit tests, one would not, well at least should not see something like this hit production anyway.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I usually add those tasks to my editor as well.  But I can see the value of something like that for things that just slip off the todo list and into the mists of bugs.  It's also a good field check for how often "else" happens.  Maybe it never happens and you don't *need* to go back an implement block two.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>From a Process perspective, you would not need to cover the possible fall-throughs if you had tests in place to cover all possible conditions. When I've added safe-guards in the past to all possible unmet conditions, the code became difficult to read. I also find that writing code for 'future-logic' often sees me writing code that won't be used as requirements change, or I mark the logic in my mind as 'complete', when the code is far from complete, because it isn't tested.</p><p>Mind you, I'm yet to see a developer create tests that would cover all possible conditions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am really not convinced that deliberately throwing an exception is a good way to remind yourself to implement a suite of code.  I'd recommend a couple of things:</p><p>1 - Write tests with good coverage<br>2 - Plan your application development path<br>3 - Consider alternatives to ColdFusion such as Java or .NET</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Paul:<br>Others mentioned unit tests too and I think it's a great idea.</p><p>As for planning... well, this IS part of the plan. I know I need to support the other condition, I just plan on doing it later.</p><p>As for your last point.... really? How does that impact here? ColdFusion is perfectly capable of testing and development paths. I really feel like your last point is totally out of place and uninformed of what CF can do.</p></div>
