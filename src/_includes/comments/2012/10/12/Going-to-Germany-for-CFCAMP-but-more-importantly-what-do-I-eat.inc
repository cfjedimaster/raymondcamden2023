		<div class="comment_text"><p>München is a wonderful city. Even just to walk around in. I have been there twice (both work-related) so I was only able to sightsee one-day for each trip.</p><p>The buildings there are amazing. I could have spent days just walking around and looking at the architecture, shops, and people. That's what I would recommend. Spend at least a half-day just walking through the city with a quality camera.</p><p>It has been 12 years since I was there last. I suspect not much has changed.</p><p>My favorite meals in München were roast duck and rabbit. Both tender and delicious.</p><p>Taking a ride on the train out to the countryside might be a fun half-day trip as well. The trains we not terribly difficult to navigate, even as a (mostly) non-German speaker. I was actually staying a the town of Weißenfeld, well outside the city and used the train to get to and from.</p><p>I am not a beer drinker, but I am sure that being in Bavaria in Oktober, you'll have no trouble finding something to drink. Even though you missed OktoberFest 2012.</p><p>Have a great time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can recommend <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.weisses-brauhaus.de%2F%3A4bzxwHHRmHwyQgDyeGLe0P-JdSo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.weisses-brauhaus.de/">http://www.weisses-brauhaus...</a>, really interesting place in which local people go to, not only tourists, not as crowded circus of HB. If you don't like it, across the street is Paulaner Brewery place, slightly fancier variation. Both places are near Marienplatz, just ask for "Tal Strasse". you can start with those two, there are lots of others around.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Food == sausages, sauerkraut and mustard are welcoming dish until you figure out German menus :)<br>Paulaner restaurant on Tal Street has great wild boar stakes...<br>And types of beers you can ask Michael or others, they know it better. Personally I enjoy more less popular brands which I can't buy back home, dark, smoky, less filtered beers are really different from the things we usually drink.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I asked a friend of mine from Germany and this is what she said:</p><p>As it's getting close to Christmas, he should look in the bakeries for: Christstollen and Lebkuchen. Maybe have some Gluhwein with these. Also definitely try some cakes and breads.</p><p>In terms of food, some of my favorites are:<br>Rindfleisch mit Meerrrettich,<br>Leberkas,<br>Sauerbraten mit Kartoffelklossen,<br>Zwiebelkuchen</p><p>Doner Kebab is also sold everywhere in the streets. It's very good and not too expensive.</p><p>But dishes (and the names for them)  are really very regional. I can speak only for Northern Bavaria. It would probably be best to ask a local once he’s there.</p><p>Germany has around 5,000 types of beer. So, beer should not be a problem at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Beer: I've been drinking the house beer wherever I go. So far it has been really good. I used to be into IPAs and stronger beers, but lately I've been enjoying simpler lagers and ales - and the beers I've had here are perfect.</p><p>Food: I've had plenty of sausage - and finally had Schnitzel(sp) last night. Loved it. I also had two very interesting berries - cow and gooseberry. These were fascinating.</p><p>I've also had suckling pork (not sure i'm saying that right) and it was excellent.</p><p>Don't tell anyone, but I had a pizza in the hotel restaurant for lunch though. ;)</p></div>
