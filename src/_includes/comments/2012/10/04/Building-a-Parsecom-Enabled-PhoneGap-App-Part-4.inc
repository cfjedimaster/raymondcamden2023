		<div class="comment_text"><p>this series is awesome and really helping me to get started with parse.. I was initially a bit scared of parse, because not familar with backbone, but your example shows a simple enough example to get me started.. what about notification services.. that would be cool to see you hooking into..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I really do want to do notifications - I'm just not sure how I'll get it into the app. The obvious way would be for the user to say, "Yes, I want notifications", and they get a notice when some reports a tip. Which... kinda makes sense. I'll try to do that this week.</p><p>Really happy you're liking it Sam!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Pete: I was considering it. Honestly, I don't know if Apple will accept it. Also, as much as I want this to be a "real" app, at the end of the day, the main point is to educate. So for example, notifications I think would be incredible. I may add them in a silly way just to get to a point where I can demo it. I'd rather do that even if it means i can't really release it as an app. Does that make sense?</p><p>Anyway - right now my thoughts are:</p><p>1) Ignore my last comment above and do Notifications<br>2) Then do the final entry talking about 'final' stuff for PG and Parse.</p><p>I kinda wanted to do Facebook connect as well, but I may just do that in a post by itself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My problem with that though is that the submission process is pretty big, and I'd say a bit OT for the main thrust of this series.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Then you need some way to note a change. Perhaps your server could use a table that just records a 'lastmod' value. Whatever the way you do it, you would have your mobile app ask the server to see if it is fresher than now, and then do the updates.</p><p>Does that make sense?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great series and a got a standalone page with all the Parse and map functionality working perfectly. But when I try and integrate it into my PG,JQM app the map doesn't fire. I have moved all the library Parse/Leaflet js/css files to the home page and visible in the resource tab loaded. Left the custom js file getting the data which is ok in the console. Googling suggests JQM and DOM but that's beyond me at the moment. Any suggestions? Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great series of tutorials - many thanks</p><p>I downloaded the code from GitHub.</p><p>I re-built the app on Phonegap Build. The only  change I made was to change 'phonegap-version' to version 3  in config.xml (phonegap wont build it with version 1 any more). and to put the reference to phonegap.js in index.html.</p><p>I can install the app on my Android tablet however it doesn't work. If I click on 'Add tip' I get the form however when I click on 'send tip' nothing happens. Also when I click on get tips I don't get the map.</p><p>It's working fine for me locally in the browser, both within Ripple and outside it. Also the app works fine on my Android when installed directly from Google Play.</p><p>Any ideas?</p></div>
