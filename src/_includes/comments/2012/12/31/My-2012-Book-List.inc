		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been hearing a lot of good things about "11/22/63" and I haven't read Stephen King in a long time so I should pick it up and add it to my 80 book to read list. I really have to stop buying books I don't have time to read.</p><p>I read Horns at exactly the wrong time and even though I thought it was a really good book I was not in the right frame of mind to truly enjoy it.</p><p>Rothfuss Kingkiller books are right up there with some of the best fantasy books I've ever read along with George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. If you liked the Kingkiller series you should dip a toe in Lois McMaster Bujold's fantasy novels starting with The Curse of Chalion.</p><p>What did you think of Reamde? I'm waiting for the HC to go on sale before I pick it up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>11/22/63 was an amazing book - it makes my top three "all time" book list. The characters were fantastic and the attention to detail was superb - King pulled that one out of somewhere.</p><p>I would recommend that to anyone and everyone.</p></div>
