		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice review. I enjoyed it a lot but was disappointed in some things. I agree with you that it was too long and the middle dragged. Ok, the rest of my comment is SPOILER FILLED!</p><p>I am totally torn on the Snoke thing. It was an awesome scene and just tossed expectations out the window, but at the same time we were invested in finding out who Snoke was, how did he get so powerful, how did he turn Ben...hopefully these will still be answered, but it left you feeling more like they will be discarded.</p><p>Same goes for Rey's parents...I kinda love that they are nobodies but I also feel like we invested a lot of energy into a dead end storyline. I love the guts it took to toss off these storylines in a way so as to start anew, but I also wonder if they tossed off one too many (one of these might have been enough to establish the new storyline going forward without leaving viewers feeling like, "Oh, I put a lot of thought into that and it was nothing at all in the end.")</p><p>Yes, Benicio Del Toro was a waste. That whole storyline was weird, even the random and brief appearance of Maz.</p><p>Laura Dern was awesome and somewhat underutilized. Part of me hopes that, no matter how improbable, her story isn't done.</p><p>And Captain Phasma...two movies and her story has gone nowhere. Why waste Gwendolyn Christie  on that?</p><p>The scene with Leia surviving in space...again, torn. On the one hand, I love that they didn't deliver on the expectation that she would be killed off in the movie due to her off screen death. However, the scene was a bit over the top not believable - especially from a character who has never really used force powers.</p><p>Anyway, don't let my criticisms make you think that I didn't enjoy it. I did. However, unlike Rogue One, it's flaws were more immediately obvious.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>re: Snoke/Rey's parents: I agree - I did invest some time into those subjects, but honestly, I'm fine with it being discarded. It's like any good edit - it shifts focus to what is really important. :)</p><p>re: LD - no way in heck she is coming back from that.</p><p>re: Phasma - I think she may come back and they will turn it into a gag - she is on screen for mere moments, bad ass, and then is quickly dealt with.</p></div>
