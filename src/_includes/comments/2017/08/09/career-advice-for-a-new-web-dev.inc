		<div class="comment_text"><p>I will tell my students about this post. One thing that I want to mention to them as a motivating factor for why they might want to blog is your Amazon wishlist.  But I don't see it as prominent on your site as it was say, a decade ago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, to be fair, the Wishlist is just for fun. I've got a link right above the comments - see it now? :) For people just starting off though, they could put serious needs on it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I also think that whiteboarding code on the fly is bullshit. I've never been able to work like that. I need time to think and formulate.
