		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, I am new to OW, but it looks like currently it does not show up in the dashboard as a service. It used to a few months ago if I remember correctly. Net Result is that if you look at your dashboard, unless you know that you have OW actions, it will not be apparent !!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thx but what I meant to say is that it does not appear under the dashboard which shows you all the services and apps you currently have running, even if you have created a few actions. </p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is a link though. If you click the "hamburger" menu on the upper left, the nav expands and reveals a link to go to your OW actions. I'm not a UI/UX expert per se, but given the amount of info for OW and BM apps and services and stuff, to me it makes sense to not include *everything* in that initial console page.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep I understand the request, open a support ticket with your feature request. <br>Currently Apps refers only to cloud foundry apps and services (cf), and openwhisk has it's own dashboard here <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.ng.bluemix.net%2Fopenwhisk%3A_XAJB2-OCxMl5Wu_URytAONAOPw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk">https://console.ng.bluemix....</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know - to me its too much info. I like the main dash being apps/services with OW having it's own page. Then again, I've got a butt ton of OW actions, maybe much more than normal.</p></div>
