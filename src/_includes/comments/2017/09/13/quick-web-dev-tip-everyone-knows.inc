		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is pretty handy. Another one I really like is being able to copy a request as cURL in the network panel and then pasting that into Postman. Charles HTTP web debugger is also awesome in that respect</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Definitely a good tip to share - I am pretty sure I knew this, but only because I remember the last 2 or 3 times I was working on a form I thought about it 5 minutes before I was done editing the code (after like an hour spent in the code-&gt; debug-&gt; refresh-&gt; repeat loop ðŸ™„ )</p><p>Also, I think you have a typo here - after second code sample 1st sentence "skaing" should be "shaking" I think....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also ngrok--it gives you a local web console interface as well, allowing you to inspect requests and a 'replay' button so you can run it, or a sequence of requests.  Especially for webhook development, where generating the request might not be as simple as just a click on a page.</p></div>
