		<div class="comment_text"><p>Does the require('alexa-verifier'); still work for you? I am getting an error "cannot find module 'alexa-verifier'. I was able to npm install it, so the package is around, but maybe not in blue mix? Is there something you need to do to access packages I missed? I remember reading something from you that not ALL packages were there, but you were using it.</p></div>
