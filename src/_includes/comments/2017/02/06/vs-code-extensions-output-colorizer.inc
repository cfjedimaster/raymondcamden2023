		<div class="comment_text"><p>Would be good to get your thoughts on "docthis" (a JSDoc commenting plugin), or similar document-generating widgets. Was looking at using this in an API-documenting workflow.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, It's nice to see you using and writing about VS Code. It seems more responsive than Brackets or Atom.  I'm looking forward to more articles about it.</p><p>I've been keeping Notepad++ or UltraEdit around as a "Notepad replacement" because they are so fast to open and can be pretty minimalistic.  Are you able to use Code for quick edits / viewing files?  Or what do you use?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It depends really. Since I can open VSC from the command line doing "code .", I use that quite a bit. If I have a random text file in the Downloads folder and I'm not there in terminal, I'll just double click it and let Notepad++ open it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So just FYI - I just published (well in the next 3 minutes) my latest review, and decided against this plugin. I really didn't like how it worked - especially they whole 'two click' approach. I found that to be really weird and not user-friendly. I guess you could say my review is that it is poorly implemented (imo) and I'm (mostly) planning on avoiding extensions I wouldn't actually recommend.</p></div>
