		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks I will check these out. One thing I cannot seem to find in vs code is an extension like eclipse's outline view. That's what is keeping me from using it. It seems to me to be a rather fundamental capability for an editor.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think this touches on what I mentioned above. Eclipse is all about giving you as many panels (views) as you want, which can lead to the IDE becoming incredibly heavy. VS Code doesn't allow for that at all - except for dumping to an output view. Well wait - no - that's not right. You can output a more designed view - I do that with my "HTML Escape" extension. So in theory, you could output something nice that represents an outline.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is there a way execute the query and save the results in Node?  I love the extension, but it appears to only replace SSMS.  Being able to reference it in code would be amazing.</p></div>
