		<div class="comment_text"><p>The issue seems to already have been fixed in Firefox Nightly (I noticed because thatâ€™s my default browser ðŸ˜Ž). Maybe it was a temporary regression.</p><p>Regarding the element in general, Iâ€™m betting on web components. Hopefully, Firefox and Edge will add support for the v1 APIs by this time next year. A <code>&lt;data-list&gt;</code> custom element could provide a consistent UI and UX out of the box.</p></div>
