		<div class="comment_text"><p>I will have to say I am a Postman super freak. I couldn't imagine working on an API without  it. I would say another awesome feature is being able to add tests to each request in a collection (did it return a 200 status code, was the response returned JSON etc.) With the collection runner you can test an entire suite of calls.</p><p>Also it makes it pretty easy to send a collection of requests to other developers on your team. I believe there is a paid option for it, but it is super easy to export a collection (it exports as JSON) and email it.</p><p>Finally, another cool feature is route parameters because every API pretty much does this now. So if I create an api URL like GET <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.site.com%2Fcustomer%2F%3Aid%3AivsK8Myprgr-PpgD5o92vK9FlRk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="api.site.com/customer/:id">api.site.com/customer/:id</a> Postman will know this is a route parameter and allow you to edit the id value just like any other parameter.</p><p>Sorry, didn't mean to be so long winded ;)</p></div>
