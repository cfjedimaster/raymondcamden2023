		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll comment here. Obviously I have a grand total of one video under my belt, so take this for what it's worth:</p><p>The process to create the content is quite a bit of work - but not overly so. I guess what I mean is, I didn't feel like their process *added* to the work in a bad way. There's a ramp up period of figuring out how to create your content the way you want, but I didn't feel like they were making me do stupid crap in relation to it.</p><p>Most of my time was spent creating the slide decks and my scripts. Scripts are not required, and I wasn't going to do them, but I'm glad I did. It make recording a lot easier. (And to be clear, you can *definitely* tweak things as you record.)</p><p>My editor was incredible. She always responded, always gave me feedback, definitely pushed me to create a better product.</p><p>In the end, you have to record on location (they support remote recordings, but in general, not for first time authors). That's a big trip (multiple day), but the entire cost is covered by Lynda.</p><p>While there, the recording process is pretty low key. You don't have to be perfect, just take it slow. If you make a mistake, you can add an audio cue and start again from where you were.</p><p>The recording location is beautiful too.</p><p>All in all an intensive process, but one I thought was well done.</p><p>In terms of compensation, obviously I'll not discuss specifics, but I felt I was *well* paid for what I did up front. I'll have to see if I make money on top of my advance. To be honest, I don't necessarily do this as a money maker since it's in my spare time. If I was solo/independent, I think it *could* be a great money maker.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congrats on launching your course! Any reason you decided to go with Lynda? I have courses on several platforms and have looked at almost all of them so I am just curious. Are you planning on releasing courses on other platforms? If you do and have any questions please feel free to reach out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A friend of mine there reached out to me and encouraged me to submit. I'm not planning on doing a *lot* of video courses. I feel like it's something I really need more time to be good at. I mean I think this is good, but it required a lot of my side time. I *may* do more, but if I do, it will be for Lynda. (Or just YouTube. :)</p></div>
