		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the article, I too have ran into issues in the past.  Yesterday, I had to update node/npm on both my work PC (windows 10) and my personal laptop (Ubuntu).  I had no issues using npm i -g npm@latest and choco upgrade nodejs for Windows.  In case it matters, I also had no issues using npm and n to upgrade on Ubuntu. :)</p></div>
