		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,<br>Very useful article. Thank you for sharing this. I was looking for something workable and easy solution and I am really glad, I found this. What I plan to develop is a similar system but on mobile devices, only. Maybe it is a crazy idea, but I give it a try. Anyway, I like this article!</p></div>
