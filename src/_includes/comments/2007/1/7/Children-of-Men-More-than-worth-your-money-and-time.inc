		<div class="comment_text"><p>Brave New World = one of my favorite books of all time.</p><p>IMO, The Village was horrible!  I saw it in the theater and had figured out the plot about 20 minutes into the movie.  Seems to me like Night is getting more predictable.  I wasn't a big fan of Unbreakable either come to think of it.  Sixth Sense was great though - someone told me what happened and somehow I was still shocked and surprised at the ending.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I also enjoyed the movie Children of Men.  However, I have a feeling the book is 100 times better (it just has that feeling of a great book where the director was forced to scrap so much goodness in order to fit the movie into a specific timespan).</p><p>The special effects and background settings were great and fit the story well (IMO).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agreed, on both! We really enjoyed Children of Men, amazing direction and cinematography, and a great story. I'll have to pick up the book.<br>And Lady in the Water was the worst movie I have seen in years. I don't know why we stayed for the whole thing...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We saw Children of Men this weekend and were very impressed. I thought it was very powerful and incredibly well made. Definitely parents only -- heavy stuff.</p><p>We rented Lady in the Water on the advice of a friend who said it was profound and affected them deeply. When it was over we looked at each other and burst out laughing. How will we ever face our friend again?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, read some reviews ray. The only thing that would "likely" cause babies to cease to be born would not just be something that would cause a fertility problem, but a complete disfunctional intimacy issue all together. My guess is that would be more of an issue to most than the lack of having children to most.</p><p>On the flip side, it is a shame that when we look at average population growth in America the figures are so tainted. Our population is not growing enough for the workforce to be replaced. Yes there are enough children being born. Yet, what is the number of those who actually reach the work force, and how many of them are legal Americans? Now... not an alarmest view like the movies because it's pretty close. What we need to realize is things we have created like social security rise and fall on having a sufficient workforce to fund the system. We had a baby boomer society that was followed by a lesser cycle and that is the type of challenges we face keeping our systems to which we have made ourselves dependent.</p><p>The movie does sound interesting... thought provoking to make us all think about our values. Are children our future only if they are still being born. Do we focus on our children because we want them to know truth, or so they can fit into society. (It seems this movie accurately brings some overtone that being politically correct challenges an honest reality check... any comments on that?)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Haven't seen Children of Men, but definitely want to.</p><p>The Sixth Sense was wonderful.  Unbreakable was so fricking *slow* to be unbearable - its like he sat with a stopwatch to see how long he could go without having anyone do or say anything ("Bruce, just walk around a bit, we've got another two minutes to waste").  I loved Signs, all except for the director's cameo (he can't act for crap).  I guessed The Village within a few minutes and was horribly let down with the whole thing.  I'll probably borrow Lady in the Water from someone at some point mainly because i want to see *how* bad it is.</p><p>I took my family to see Night at the Museum and was plesantly surprised - it was better than I thought it would be, given I don't like Ben Stiller, though I couldn't stand Rick Gervais' part as he was unfunny.</p></div>

It is movies like these that makes me not like Science Fiction.</p><p>Here is the problem with most Science Fiction. It is the future. Things look bleak. Conditions are horrible. Isn't that kind of depressing. The other problem with Science Fiction is that producers and writers feel they to explain everything.</p></div>
