		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think you should restrict it based just on emptiness of the seat. I think you /could/ take into account the height of the person behind you.. I would say take a glance back, and if their head is higher than the seat back. It's a no. Or if as you are putting your seat back, you hear any type of grunting... it's a no...</p></div>

Its the only way I am comfortable on a flight.  On the occasions when I get a non-reclining seat I am miserable.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>Actually, if someone behind me is tall and nicely mentions it to me, I'll be considerate.</p><p>Ray, what I would suggest is always go to the airport early and ask the gate agent or agent at the check-in *VERY NICELY* if they can please put you in an exit row or the bulkhead row.  Also, check out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FSeatGuru.com%3AvIbFJPLyY5dXqK97pxF2zUXUBD8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="SeatGuru.com">SeatGuru.com</a> to avoid getting stuck in the worst seat on the plane.  Unfortunately, unless you fly a lot this may not help you. Those of us with status on various airlines usually get the   best selection of seats -- including exit rows when I make a reservation! -- that people who fly less regularly don't get.</p><p>Oh, and if you're an @$$ about dealing with your way-too-close-for-comfort neighbor, all bets are off.</p><p>-dhs</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Amen on the seat rule. On a small jet ride from Philly to State College, PA, I actually had a women in front of me try to force her seat back despite the fact that my knees were firmly planted in the back of the seat (you know how small planes go with leg room). When she was unable to do so, she actually switched seats with her 250lb husband whom further tried to push the seat back beyond my knees! It's like they just wanted to make me angry. They lost ;-)<br>Did they expect I should lift them up to my chest? Arrggghhh. I cannot stand when people put there seat back! Long-legged travelers of the world unite!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure I understand the seat complaint.  I mean, it's not like these things are barcaloungers.  They recline, what?  Approximately 3/4 to 7/8 of an inch?  Are they really that bad?</p><p>Now granted, I'm not a tall man at 5'10" (6'10" with the afro), but nor am I "wee".  It's never really bothered me when the person in front of me reclines.</p><p>Of course, you could also look at it from the other direction and ask why bother reclining when your angle of repose is altered so modestly...  :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rob,</p><p>I get why people complain... I'm 5'7 on a good day and in some planes the reclined seat is sitting about 6 inches from my nose... unless I recline.  And forget about opening a laptop (Dell... my Mac has a lower profile and works better on flights for that reason).</p><p>Mike, I'm with you.  I'm not a big guy (see above... I'm not too wide either) but it kills me when I get sat next to the biggest dude on the plane and I can't GET in my seat because he is overflowing his seat.  On a flight from DC to Seattle I sat in the window seat of an isle that didn't recline with a 6'5" behemoth next to me in the middle seat.  None of us were comfortable and we couldn't move an inch.  That was one of the worst transcontinental flights ever...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I flew JetBlue - LOTS of legroom and plenty of space to recline your seat without it affecting the person behind! I had my 15" MBP open on my tray for most of the flight with the person in front reclined with no problem. I highly recommend JetBlue (it was my first time with them and I was very impressed - I'll definitely fly JetBlue again!).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was never bothered by someone in front of me putting their seat back, so its never bothered me to do the same.</p><p>Frankly, we all know the downsides of flying: cramped spaces, long lines and annoying people. I feel its a situation just to be tolerant of for the few hours you have to be in the air/airport. So rather than whining I just enjoy the ride, maybe have a drink or two and read a book. Beats the alternative.</p><p>I guess what I am trying to say is you will enjoy your experience a lot more if you relax.</p></div>
