		<div class="comment_text"><p>I highly recommend you attend the "CFCs ARE the Framework" by Steve Nelson (if you weren't already planning to catch that one).  He gave us a preview of his presentation at the Maryland CFUG a few months ago, and his CFC-based framework is both simple and compelling.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would love it if they would record these session and then post them on YouTube or something. I can't stand the fact that when you can't make it to these conferences, you get screwed on the information. I wouldn't even mind paying to watch some of the sessions that are going to taken place. I would love to see yours and Steve Nelson's presentations.</p></div>
