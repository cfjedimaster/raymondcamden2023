		<div class="comment_text"><p>A little off topic, but something Dan might want to look at, is cfchat (at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfchat.net%2Fhome%2F%29%3AlobCdlVPLFNt1pNNTdJDfbdL7c0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cfchat.net/home/)">http://cfchat.net/home/)</a>.  We needed chat functionality for a few apps quite some time ago, and it worked like a charm.  A lot cheaper than building your own as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sam,</p><p>Thanks for the link, but I need something based off of XMPP.  I really love the Jabber world, so I think I will stick with what I have been developing.  Using XMPP, a lot of external chat applications such as google talk will be able to communicate with my application.  I am using the Smack library  to take care of the XMPP protocol for me.  I will probably release my Coldfusion/Smack library when I am done with it.  It supports everything Smack supports, except I am not quite sure how I am going to pull off voice.</p></div>
