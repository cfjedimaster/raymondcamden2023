Hold on a little longer. Oh, FYI, it was I who pushed Ray to move RIAForge to Scorpio, and FWIW, there are actually public facing <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FAdobe.com%3AF-lEhjY67nEyMJ-Pxxz4lVWafuI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Adobe.com">Adobe.com</a> sites that have been running on Scorpio since the earliest alpha days.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not to open a whole can of worms, but most CF devs will tell you that MySpace is NOT a good example of a CF site. They publicly admitted their development process was to just code and throw crap up on the server. Then they complain when CF doesn't perform? Sorry - but I don't buy it. ColdFusion could have easily supported MySpace with the proper development methodology.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>imo myspace is similar to what digg experienced. In the beginning it was an idea and probably an excited coder to get a basic shell up there before other people. Once it caught on it becomes obvious the original design wasn't intended to serve that sheer nbr of visitors effectively. Digg did a rehaul, myspace probably needs too (although thats a discussion for if the next fad is here or too close anyhow for it to matter lol).</p><p>my pocket change anyhow.</p></div>

I understand that they never intended to allow people to "skin" their pages...but people do it, and MySqace could make a few small changes to make it a LOT less painful...ids on major page elements...? Also, with the help of BD/ASP.Net, they are slowly transitioning bits of the site over to .Net.</p><p>I think that it would be cool for them to publish a fake dataset (like netflix has done) to allow developers to hack on new features...friend/message search anyone?
