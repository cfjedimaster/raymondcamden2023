		<div class="comment_text"><p>We use a CF/AjaxCFC/YUI platform that has served us well (we occasionally sprinkle in some DOJO components, but they are often so undocumented that it is easier to just find an alternative).  I seriously cannot think of a single reason we would ever need Flex.  I know it has a good-sized following, but the overhead cost just totally scares us off (it is important to note:  we haven't looked at flex since the initial final release, and its entirely possible that the performance issues have been dealt with and we simply don't know it).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having used both, I am in complete agreement with Ray, they both have their benefits and their place (and can both easily be overused). By first release are you speaking pre-Flex 2? If so, I recommend you give it another look.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The problem is that at this point we are so deeply entrenched in CF/Ajax, I can't even imagine us even thinking about making any technology changes.  And, again, if you have a CF/Ajax/YUI platform, what don't you have that Flex brings to the table?</p><p>That is the real issue that I can't get my head around.  WHY use Flex?  i mentioned this before, and Ray thought I was asking, 'Why RIAs', but this isn't the case.  I GET the RIA concept, and we actually use it in almost all of our apps.  I just don't understand what Flex has to offer that we aren't already getting - other than wrapping it up into one nice little package (but then, at least at our last look, you get the overhead cost that comes with it).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am not in love with Flex 2, perhaps it was the disorganized presentation at CFUnited that first turned me off. I too do not see the need to go to a Flex engine when AJAX seems to do the trick. But as the Flex product matures and no doubt becomes more accessible for CF developers, I will take another look.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is almost my point exactly.  Ajax not only 'does the trick' for us, it does it WELL.  Its fast, and our code is well organized and straightforward.</p><p>AjaxCFC allows us to pass EXTREMELY complex data structures back and forth between our front-end page and our back-end CFC - and it does this completely without any kind of configuring on our end.  The ONLY reason I can even imagine anyone using Flex would be for the UI capabilities, and for that you can use YUI, DOJO, QooXDoo, or any of a number of JS UI packages.  And all of these come *without any additional overhead* - this is an EXTREMELY important point.</p><p>I have been asking the *exact* same question ever since CFUNITED last year, and have never - not ONCE - gotten a decent answer:  why would I use Flex instead of CF/Ajax?  Not some, "there are places for both yada yad yada yada" but a *firm* WHY.</p><p>Anyone?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>While I think it is odd that this has somehow turned into a Flex vs Ajax debate - must it always end this way :\ - in my opinion you are turning the argument upside-down and that is why you have never seen an answer you like. First, Flex isn't just about passing data (which is all AjaxCFC handles) but about a rich UI. Yes, you can do this with a bunch of different libraries in Ajax, but this is notoriously complex, and often very poorly documented. Also, Ajax can be extremely difficult to debug.</p><p>If you actually tried using Flex 2 (which has minimal overhead that you are so obsessed with - I have used plenty of very slow Ajax apps), I think the conclusion you would come to is, you use Flex wherever possible and Ajax only when the Flash 9 requirement would be onerous.</p><p>The Flex UI is *far* richer than anything I have seen done in Ajax (and don't get me wrong I have seen some really sweet Ajax apps that I use daily and I have done some nice stuff with Ajax myself). It supports automatically translating native CF data types - including CFCs. I mean seriously, the only argument here is because you don't want to be convinced...which is perfectly ok if you are happy with the way you do things, but you seem to want others to be forced to agree with you and accept that because you didn't like the CFUnited presentation this is somehow an argument against Flex...</p><p>Go on...do what you do...Ajax is very cool and very useful and if you insist on not being convinced of Flex, that is fine, but can we drop the argument?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Haha I didn't mind the presentation at all at CFUNITED.  And its not that I don't want to be convinced - when I first saw Flex, I thought I was in love.  I agree - the UI capabilities are simply insane!</p><p>However...that being said, the overhead costs are, in my opinion, prohibitive.</p><p>Yes, achieving decent UI with JS libraries can be a pain in the.....behind.  If the overhead issues went away, I would move to flex tomorrow.  I just can't justify a trade-off to my employer or our users.  I think (and again, this is just my humble opinion) that the typical user would rather lose a bit of the UI glamor, and at the same time speed up the application's load time - in some cases *dramatically*.</p><p>If I have sounded like I am trying to simply rain on Adobe's parade here, I apologize - seriously.  I LOVE ColdFusion, and again, noone was more in love with the Flash Forms (and then, when it was released, Flex) than I was.</p><p>But that friggin load time kills me every time.  I just can't get around it.  I have seen flex apps that take 30, 35 seconds just to LOAD!  Let me be the one to tell you this - if your app takes 35 seconds to load, you user left 25 - 28 seconds ago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am not pissed and don't think you are raining on anyone's parade, I just find it difficult to argue a point when someone is asking to be convinced of something they are already convinced of...these things go in circles.</p><p>Anyway, in response to your biggest concern about load times:</p><p>Flex 1.5 admittedly had horrible load times, but this is no longer the case in 2. First off, you can deploy directly as a SWF (and I believe this is the recommended deployment - anyway, FDS is required to do otherwise), so the app caches locally and really doesn't load that slowly in the first place. Does this mean it is as fast as an Ajax app?...well, sometimes perhaps, but probably in the usual case, no. However, the load times are fast enough that when a rich UI is needed, then use Flex. If you are doing some simple asynchronous functionality that wouldn't benefit from the UI, use Ajax.</p><p>On a somewhat related note, I personally think that the tendency to deploy Flex apps as full-page will slow and there will be more widgets built into pages where needed (this may already be happening on a grand scale but in general all the apps I see are full-pagers). I think this will also contribute to making it easier to include Flex apps in your average consumer facing page.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll ditto some of Brian's comments. The UI you can do with Flex is far more powerful then what you can do with HTML, and 100% compatible as long as you have Flash (which is at what - 110% penetration? ;). You also get media abilities like streaming music. You can even talk to a web cam if you wanted.</p><p>Don't forget that Flash Remoting is _very_ slim. Perhaps not as slim as JSON.</p><p>Also look at Flex Data Services. That is pretty much impossible with AJAX (unless you want to do a lot of polling).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm in the process of wrapping up a Flex app for which I researched and presented both Flex and Ajax as options, and we of course, chose Flex in the end. Here are our reasons:<br>- No cross-browser issues to deal with<br>- Tight CF/Flex integration (RPC, CF-to-Flex objects etc)<br>- Low cost and quick ramp to productivity ($900 for FB2, immediate results - no mucking around with limited documentation or figuring out someone else's code)<br>- Commercially supported product<br>- Slick appearance (I'm a designer first and foremost, so this is always important to me :)</p><p>And lastly, it was my preference for ActionScript 3 over JavaScript as a lauguage to write that sealed the deal.</p><p>Hope that helps someone!</p></div>
