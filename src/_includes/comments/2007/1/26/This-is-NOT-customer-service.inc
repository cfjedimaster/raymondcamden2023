		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is why I'm an advocate of not using shared services (unless it something rather benign like personal email forwarding).  I whole-heartedly recommend using VPS solutions if you cannot afford a dedicated server.  Heck, you can even load in several smaller websites on one VPS account.</p><p>I have three VPS accounts at a provider (you can figure out who if you see the banner on my blog).  One of them runs a website that gets 250,000+ page views a month and we pay less than $40 a month for hosting for each VPS.</p><p>What's cheaper?  Slightly more cash up front for hosting or the potential of many hours of dealing with shared hosting issues.  In the end, you'll spend more hours over the time span of a year dealing with silly problems than you save by using shared hosting.  Spend the cash up front and save yourself the hassle!  Rant over...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Now I'm dying to know who it is and who you might all recommend.  I'm having all kinds of issues with HMS.  They seem to have a kneejerk reaction of "it's your code".  Turned out the last one was that they had upgraded to mySQL 5, but not upgraded jdbc drivers, so it errored every time you tried to call a stored procedure.  They argued for two weeks that it was my code, and I finally set up test pages to prove it wasn't.  They never were able to resolve the problem, so they went back to the old driver and I changed all my sp calls to normal cf query calls.</p><p>I'm so frustrated...Peter, where are you getting vps for 40 bucks if you don't mind me asking?</p></div>

I hardly have any issues with them and if I do, they're extremely quick to respond and remedy the problem. $19.95/month, 8 domain names, 1 MySQL, 1 MSSQL, shared SSL, etc. There are other hosting companies with probably better stuff. But, I don't need much, so it works out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd like to point out here that should anyone else be in this position (where you want to get the log files for just your application in a shared host--or multi-app corporate server), there is a way to do that with a little-known feature of the free Log Parser tool.</p><p>In the Oct CFDJ, I did an article on it , explaining how it can analyze log files in powerful ways, primarily by using SQL against them.</p><p>But to this point, I concluded the article by showing a feature that many never even notice: it can extract out subsets of logs based on the values of one of the log's columns, and I specifically showed extracting out per-application log files from the CF application.log.</p><p>The tool also offers a checkpoint feature for logs which, like many of CFs, are not rotated and so grow and grow continuously. Using this feature, the report can be run daily (or however often one desires) without redisplaying past data.</p><p>Check out the article at:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoldfusion.sys-con.com%2Fread%2F296223.htm%3AGJ6VPNJBnZeyYqChwdWqUJfAXgA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/296223.htm">http://coldfusion.sys-con.c...</a></p><p>I realize it may be a bit much to expect the hosting company to implement this for you, but if it helps them solve this problem for all its customers (and since it's free), it's worth a shot. Hope it helps other readers here.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What a great thread. I've been with Coldfusion since 1996.<br>The most reliable cf host I've used with all our clients<br>is <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fedgewebhosting.net%3APoxvVBJSDRDIxoMZbFPyQQnKF-c&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="edgewebhosting.net">edgewebhosting.net</a>.  I'm only responding because I recently have had to work with a few sites on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostmysite.com%3AztrKeOUKmog7P-dSXj3cUUhcUfs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostmysite.com">hostmysite.com</a>. I've always seen people post how great they are and they win best hosting company or something with CF journal.</p><p>Now to be fair, all the sites are on their $29 shared host but I have had nothing but jrun server errors, ect for the last week. They usually more or less say "I don't see anything wrong" but every time my clients and I pull up a page we see the errors. My clients want to move = I look bad since I recommended them. I've only been with them less than 8 months, but it looks like I'll get them on edgeweb too.  Maybe their more expensive hosting is better I don't know.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To Sid, who asked for a URL to the article without the annoying video and popups that display on all sys-con pages, I will say both that here is a URL that avoids it, by going to the print view instead (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoldfusion.sys-con.com%2Fread%2F296223.htm%29%3AWAX2mP6E50p2ctkuJbrdKatEs0M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/296223.htm)">http://coldfusion.sys-con.c...</a>.</p><p>Perhaps more important, I will say to all reading that I have been in contact recently with the folks there to complain vehemently about that video and those popups. I'm really trying to persuade them of the negatives of that. We shall see. Let's not start a big discussion of that here on Ray's blog, though. Drop me a note separately (charlie@carehart.org) and if there seems enough interest I'll start a public blog entry of my own on the matter.</p></div>
