		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, this s great.  I did find some anomalies in  the survey.cfc.  You have instances of survey_result and then just result.  It's an easy fix, but I thought I would let you know.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is intentional. One table is the primary row, ie, user X did the survey on date Y. The other table has N rows for each result in the survey you took.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My fault.  I added a prefix of surveys_ and in my haste to get things working I inadvertently ended up with two tables that have the same name.  I am be starting over.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I should note that the css for the front end is now css based making it easier to update the look and feel for your UI. The admin section was built with tables with the thought you wouldn't need change it. The admin section can still be changed using the templates Ray built.</p><p>I have a 22 inch monitor, Ray has something around there as well ( plus on a Mac ) so I tried to get fonts as readable as i could from screen to screen. They can be adjusted in the admin css sheet.</p><p>Just thought I would through that in there for you Ray.</p></div>
