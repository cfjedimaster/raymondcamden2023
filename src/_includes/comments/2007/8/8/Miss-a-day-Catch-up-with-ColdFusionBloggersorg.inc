		<div class="comment_text"><p>Technically it is past 24 hours. I scheduled it for 12 AM Eastern.</p><p>As for your second question - did you notice the Stats link on top? One of the stats is top entries over the past 24 hours.</p><p>As a side note - I removed the "last search" from the side pod. Too many damn idiots putting crap in. Pardon the french - but I'm just disappointed. I didn't mind so much the "boob" searches, but one user took it too far.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, no, I missed that. I noticed the "Stats" on the right nav bar, and it was static info, so I had no reason to consider that the top stats link was going to be any different. It's a shame if others are missing it. Perhaps you could add even a few words in that right nav bar to indicate what one may see in the top one.</p><p>As for Edward's later comment praising being able to receive blogs by email, I'll say I'm a fan of that approach as well (yes, I do know about RSS readers). Beyond using Ray's feature here to get an aggregation of all blogs he watches, I'll note that if you just want to watch one particular blog, I had written an entry about a couple of services that do that last year, and I leverage them every day:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tipicalcharlie.com%2Fblog_email_notification_by_squeet.htm%3AC3ldKwOIK2sn0gOu6NWmzBJcmYU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.tipicalcharlie.com/blog_email_notification_by_squeet.htm">http://www.tipicalcharlie.c...</a></p><p>Ignore the reference to Squeet in the URL (which no longer works), but check out the others I refer to.</p></div>
