		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's actually a tip that's given on page 3 of the quickstart guide: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.model-glue.com%2F%3ANavPAIvwOWZ7OgbfyDBeS6gqc_o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://docs.model-glue.com/">http://docs.model-glue.com/</a> - though the idea of using "myself" isn't stressed and the benefits it provides aren't as clearly outlined.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well that is just one tip - and Mark has a whole series of them. As we all know - folks don't always read the docs anyway. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I was coming up with the tips, I didn't mean to re-create the documentation, but just to re-iterate good ways to help oneself... of course, I have another couple of posts, that I am sure are also in the documentation ;) so go read all of it before I post!</p></div>
