		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, thanks for posting this.  The real bottom line question is knowing your recommendation for the team approach, should I  not even consider job opportunities where I'd be the sole developer.  I've been offered some of those jobs and could probably teach myself, but you hit the nail on the head, socially, I've been craving to work with others and want to learn fast.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wouldn't say no to a solo gig - solo versus team is just one factor really. Here are some other things I'd consider:</p><p>a) What technologies are in play? Does it maybe use a database you are a bit unfamiliar with? It could be a good learning experience.</p><p>b) What 'area' is it in - ie, is it a web site for an industry you've never worked with? That would good for your resume as well.</p><p>c) And of course $$. Money isn't everything, but it sure is nice. Let me trademark that phrase: Money is nice(tm).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ Matthew</p><p>Then go with the team job.  I couldn't tell you how many times that working with someone else has made the project go by sooo much faster.  You'll end up learning different approaches to the same problem, you'll recover faster from mistakes and you'll most likely make a friend.</p><p>I believe that solo gigs pay better and give you a better chance at advancement, while a team will give you a chance at completing more projects faster.</p><p>Good luck to you either way!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My .02 cents...</p><p>a) Work with people you like. Making lots of $$ but working with people you don't like isn't worth it...</p><p>b) I learned a lot working solo - because I DIDN'T have co-workers to turn to - I had to figure everything out on my own - that was fun for awhile but now I'm in a team environment and really having fun contributing.  Working solo also takes a lot of self-discipline...</p><p>c) Money.  What Ray trademarked... :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I work for a company where there is an IT group, but I'm the only Intranet web person.  I do have to work with some of the other IT people but most of my projects I'm the only one working on them.  I get some of the social aspects being on the IT team, but I know it's hurt my development on learning CF or another technologies. Being the only one using CF here has it's advantages and disadvantages.  The hardest thing working on solo projects is you can't bouce ideas or questions off someone else.  You can't ask someone if this is the best way to code a certain section.  But working solo does push you to learn and research things you need to know.  I'm with Ray, working solo or on a team is only one factor in taking a job.  Look at the overall picture.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Although - these days - working solo - you can bounce ideas around on mailing lists, blogs, and user groups (if you have one nearby)... still not the same as walking down the hall to chat with a co-worker - but an option...</p><p>I can remember starting out in CF when it first came out and there was nothing really until CFTalk came along...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've found that by far the best way to really, deeply understand something is to write about it and teach it to other people. You might think you know something well, until you try to explain it to someone else. That is when every hole in your knowledge will become glaringly obvious. So teach others. Write a blog. Talk at a user group. Record an online presentation. Whatever works for you.</p><p>Also, read. A lot. Read the Pragmatic Programmer. Then read it again. I read this book about once a year and I learn or understand something better every time. Play with other languages. You get the idea.</p><p>With regard to working on a team vs. individually, I'd say all things equal, work on a team. You will probably learn more. However, there is a certain power (and risk of course) in building things yourself. You get to experiment to your heart's content. Of course, when things go wrong, you don't have to look far for the person to blame. ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I feel that I'm a fairly competent CF developer now, and would really like to do more "fun" projects to get even better; however, this is where the problem comes in.  I have some difficulty coming up with projects that no one else has written before (and probably better).</p><p>It seems that most fun projects I write are very small projects or just code snippets to ease my development time (something to check valid IPs against a table, a data validation tag for entering data into a dB).  I see all of these mid-to-huge projects (which I know started perhaps from the small project and probably just exploded as they were developed), but getting that initial spark is what frustrates me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Matt, just some thoughts (and I've been where you are!).</p><p>1) I also would lean towards working in a team. When looking for a position, pay attention to the business use case for the technology. It's never too early to learn how the business works.</p><p>2) Get certified. Are you junior? Are you senior? I don't know, that's all kind of relative. If you are a certified CF developer, I know you know the language, if nothing else. You'll also learn alot just studying for the exam.</p><p>Cheers, and good luck.</p><p>Davo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've done both solo and team projects, and IMO both of them are valuable. When working solo, I had to take responsibility for things I wasn't as comfotable/knowledgeable about, forcing me to go the extra mile to learn them well in order to come up with a quality product. On the other hand, working in a team you get to benefit from the knowledge of others. All those invaluable little tips, from keyboard shortcuts to IDE settings to design patterns to whatever else. Right now I work mostly solo, so I basically resort to reading tons of blogs. I go though my RSS reader about twice a day, and I have to say there is some invaluable information being shared on many blogs. Ray's is one. Others among my favorites, in no particular order, are Brian Rinaldi, Joe Rinehart, Peter Bell, and Ben Nadel. There are many others. Take the time to read them, especially when you're working solo, those people will replace your co-workers for advice. And they do it well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Matt,</p><p>Like a lot of guys I have done both solo and team work.  I worked from home 4 years solid (only went on site for meetings) and while at first I enjoyed it I missed the social  (and technical) exchanges that you have in a team environment.</p><p>People tackle problems differently and the interaction you have in a team environment can lead to you solving those problems perhaps more efficiently when you are exposed to more than one method.</p><p>In the end I would suggest doing all of it, team, solo, php, dotNet and any other language or technology you have an opportunity to get exposed to.  Everything that you experience can come back and help you in ways you just don't yet realize.</p><p>Good luck in with any path you choose!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you end up in a job with a team, balance yourself out by doing some solo projects in your off time, as Ray mentioned. If  you end up in a job as the only developer, join or start an open source project with a team. Or get your local CFUG to start a team pro bono project. You can have your cate and eat it too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I worked with ColdFusion/SQL Server exclusively from 1999-2007, working in an office with a small team of developers.  This past January I took a 180 degree turn at took a solo job, working from home, doing PHP and mySQL.  I have learned a lot about myself, my work patterns, and how *sorely* I miss working on a team.</p><p>I made a lot of good friends at my previous job so I bounce a lot of ideas off of them via IM/phone at least a few times a week.  They are always open to help, as I have returned the favor just as much.  Sometimes all you want is just someone to confirm your suspicions about an approach or a methodology.</p><p>But, the solo work has been super cool too -- I love the freedom, love that I have utter control over the projects, and that I am able to be at home all day long with my beautiful daughters.  I love not driving 40 miles to work each way like I used to, and sleeping in!</p><p>Ahhh, whatever works!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Matthew,</p><p>I too am self-taught and have been working solo for 2 years. I have made many friendships with different levels of programmers that I communicate with on a daily basis. When I'm venturing off into something new, I go to one of my IM buddies and bounce the idea of them to get some feedback as to where I should start, if they've had experience, and so on... Just recently, one of my buddies invited me to work on a BD.NET project which I quickly jumped at to get the experience of working with somethign different. I find myself taking time out to play with a new concept or try something different and than apply it to the app i'm working on. It is impossible to do everything by yourself even if you are working from home without a team. I have a designer and an html guy that I work with who handle that for me, and I do the database work and the CF programming.</p><p>Just some thoughts!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wonder about what is considered "training".<br>Training should be more Input than Output.<br>People say that doing solo projects would be a good source for training, but it strikes me as being heavy on the output (you coding instead of reading).  Of course you have to try things out to cement them in your mind, but I think people should make an effort to read more than trying to write more code.<br>If you use the same techniques that you use at your job, that becomes a rut.</p></div>
