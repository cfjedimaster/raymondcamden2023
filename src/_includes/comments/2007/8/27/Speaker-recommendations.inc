		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was going to stay out of this since one of my hobbies is building speakers, and i tend to be a speaker snob, but every time i see the Bo$e word it makes my skin crawl.</p><p>IMO Bo$e you are paying for marketing not quality.  Take apart any Bo$e and you will find about $5 worth a parts.</p><p>Just my two cents.  Take the extra money that Bo$e charges and get a system with a sub so you get the low notes.</p><p>Here is what i listen to at work.  It is a speaker project that took on a life of it's own one day when i got a lathe.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just went through this myself when I bought a new laptop with the world's worst speakers (my old one had acceptable, but not great built-in Harmon Kardons).  I didn't want to spend a ton but wanted quality sound.  I landed on the Logitech Z-4 and really like them!  I listen to music for about 8-10 hours a day while working, and so far so good.  I got them at Circuit City for 60 bucks during a sale. From my research, I don't think you can get better speakers for the price.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't gone yet. I hope to go this weekend, maybe during the sales. My ears are beginning to hurt after a whole day of listening with headphones. (Although my headphones are very, very nice. They are professional DJ style headphones and have amazing quality. But after 8 hours, I've had enough.)</p></div>

Come hang out with speaker geeks and listen to their designs.  Keep an eye on the parts express tech talk for when it will happen.</p><p>Maybe your first project will be a set of speakers for Ray.</p><p>:)</p><p>To keep this on topic; Ray, if i were to buy a computer speaker system i would look for a set with a subwoofer.  No small speakers can make the low notes.</p><p>A 3", and smaller driver, is capable of reproducing the highs and mids, just not very loud.  But since we are talking about computers speakers that will be used for near field listening they are perfect.  I would never recommend small speakers for home theater use or any far field configuration.  If you see a speaker with larger drivers you should see a tweeter thrown into the mix.</p><p>Look for speakers that seem heavy for their size and have a well built speaker box.</p><p>For features i would look for is a volume knob that is easy to get to when the phone rings and you have to turn the tunes down.  A place to plug head phones in and if you have an iPod a place to plug that in.  Ignore watts (remember we are listening to these near field), and pseudo sound field simulation effects.</p><p>If i were shopping by brand i have personal experience with JBL and Harman Kardon speakers and i can recommend them.</p><p>Have fun shopping!</p></div>
