		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's a shorter link<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobechats.adobe.acrobat.com%2Fp17717628%2F%3AMeEgbUInqrBTRXFfR3l4SmoNSJo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p17717628/">http://adobechats.adobe.acr...</a></p><p>Thanks so much for speaking tonight.  It was great!</p><p>And thanks for shrinking the resolution down to 1024x768.  Because of that the animations were much better.  I wish more presenters knew about the tips and tricks of using Breeze/Connect.  (I should porbably make a blog post about it).</p><p>As soon as you go over 1024x768 (regardless of your internet speed) Breeze gets so slow that the refresh rate makes it impossible to use decent animations.  Until Adobe uses codecs like Variable Bit Rate (VBR) in the flash player we're stuck with that problem (don't count your stars... I've been asking for VBR support in Flash for years :) ).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, please do, Jeff.  You may also want to put in the fact that people new to Breeze/Connect should plan on setting up their session about half hour before the actual presentation to iron out the connect bugs and such with the presentation host.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree Lola LB, I went to a CFUG meet for the CF8 launch and there were some issues with audio among other things that probably could have been ironed out a little earlier.</p><p>Ray, how well does the cflayout stuff degrade if javascript is turned off, etc.?</p><p>Also, totally unrelated to the presentation, but what's the cool firefox extension that shows the mem free and cpu usage? :)</p><p>Great presentation, thanks!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry about that, I paused at about 20 minutes in and didn't see that you tested it with the cfpods. So it would probably degrade okay as long as the content was inside the layout. Maybe just a cfinclude inside the layout then. Either way, pretty cool stuff.</p><p>...and now, back to watch the rest of the presentation and hopefully reduce the number of silly questions...</p></div>
