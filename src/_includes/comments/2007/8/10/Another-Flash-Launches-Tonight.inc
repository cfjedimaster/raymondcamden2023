		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I set the Tivo up to record it the other day.  But I also noticed that other channels were carrying it.  Most importantly one of them was carrying it in HD (so I set that one to record).</p><p>Not sure if the other channels are airing the same day/time, but I'd rather check it out in HD if available.  Why Sci-Fi still hasn't gone HD, I don't know (I'm sure there are legitimate reasons, but still... why?).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll pass.  Everytime I start to enjoy a sci-fi show they cancel it (Farscape, SG1, Battlestar, Dresden).  If Flassh's numbers aren't through the roof, then sci-fi will fade it out and produce more D tv movies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was bad. :)  Friend of mine mentioned that the show isn't based off the old movie, but the old comics back in the day.  Regardless, it wasn't good. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry to hear it sucked guys.</p><p>@Ray: Babylon 5 is a good series to delve into.  The show wasn't going to be renewed for the 5th season, so Season 1-4 built up to a good finale.</p><p>@Jeremy:  No reason SG-1 couldn't go a few more.  RDA needed to stay around.  Dr. Who has continually evolved and stayed around.  Oh well!</p></div>
