I still need to use Outlook for mailing lists (like CF-Talk).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This isn't quite off topic since you mentioned it in your post, but what exactly do you take melatonin for?  What does it do? Is it an over-the-counter product?  How long did it take you to notice its beneficial affects?  And, finally, how long do the effects last (ie., do you feel groggy during the day)?  Guess I could google this, but it would seem more credible from someone actually using it.</p><p>Thank you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Melatonin is a natural product - over the counter type thing. The effects are noticed immediately. Err, well, it isn't a sleeping pill per se. It won't make you tired. For me the big thing was _keeping_ me asleep. If I don't take it, I will wake up every single night. Not for a long time - probably just a minute or two - but my sleep is much more peaceful with it.</p><p>It does not make me groggy in the morning. Well... maybe a little bit... but to me - this was good. I was waking up super early because my brain was -extremely- active. Waking up a bit groggy is actually a nicer feeling for me now. (And it goes away within a few minutes.)</p><p>My daughter (5) takes it as well to help her sleep.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Mike, I cannot speak from experience, but Melatonin is just a hormone naturally produced by the body. It regulates a bunch of stuff, including body temperature, and sleep. It is produced during dark times of the day. It is theorized that it plays a role in SAD - season affective disorder - because in the winter, there is less light and it throws off people's melatonin levels.... ok, that's all I got from a semester of Nutrition and Develpoment :) I have heard LOTS of people say very good things about taking it supplementally.</p><p>@Ray,</p><p>Not sure what it is about Outlook that feels right for lists. Maybe it's just faster and there is so much more to filter... I would love for it to feel right in GMail.</p></div>

I re-read my questions and it was almost like I asked for your medical history (sorry).  And now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that one of the guys that works for me mentioned something about melatonin.  Must be something to it.</p><p>Thanks again!</p></div>
