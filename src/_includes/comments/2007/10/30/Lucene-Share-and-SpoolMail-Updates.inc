		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Thanks again for great tools. I had thought I was familiar with most of your projects, but I seem to have missed SpoolMail, which, as you say, is terrific for use on a development server where you can't actually send the mail. This is a constant issue for me, when a project requires some sort of notification service, but digging through the Undelivered folder is a pain. Thanks very much.</p><p>I'll note, for others, that the current udf.cfm in SpoolMail is written as CF8 only, since it uses a couple of operators that could not be used outside of CFSCRIPT until CF8. But for a CF 7 version, it's only necessary to make simple changes in lines 161 and 169.</p><p>Tom</p></div>
