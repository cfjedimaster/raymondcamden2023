		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray<br>I recently used your toXML but had hack it a bit to get it to work with multi-dimensional structures. A feature to consider for the next release? I'll send my code through if I manage to get the recursive version working correctly. At the moment I've just used to loops to allow for another level.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Devon, my component(s), <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbetterxml.riaforge.org%2F%3AFnsIzpM2r7nyz7J2jCe3dZV7Wv0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://betterxml.riaforge.org/">http://betterxml.riaforge.org/</a>, will work with 'multi-dimensional' structs and also allows you to insert the xml created into other XML using XPath (and lots more).</p><p>Ray, I was wondering if I could use any of your components methods in my own. I think the Query one would be very useful (of course it would be fully credited).</p><p>Dom</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Devon: I did do some work after this release on getting recursiveness working. I'll have it in the next version.</p><p>Dominic: Sure thing. Sounds like we've got similar products - no reason we can't share.</p></div>
