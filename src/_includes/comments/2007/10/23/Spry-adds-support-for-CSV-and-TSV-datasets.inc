		<div class="comment_text"><p>The examples no longer work. As this entry was from three years ago - I can't really say why. I don't use Spry anymore. Actually, looking at the sample code with the call to Spry like so: /spryjs, that is most likely the issue. I no longer have the libraries there. So if you download my sample, and Spry separately, you should be able to run them on your own machine.</p></div>
