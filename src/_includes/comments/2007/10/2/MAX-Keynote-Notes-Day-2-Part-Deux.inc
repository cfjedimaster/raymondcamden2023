		<div class="comment_text"><p>I really did Narciso. As a developer, I normally couldn't care less about designer stuff - but that tool was not only cool - but actually something that will help me!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If MAX wasn't cool enough, Thermo is by far the star of the conference.  Other technologies that are on display and/or planned are cool, but Thermo is the product that will take RIA and Flex development to a completely new level.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You would think that the Adobe home page would be featuring stuff from MAX on the home page to demonstrate their various media capabilities - perhaps a downloadable AIR app that live streams the speakers? Or how about a Flash app that lets you sift through the various bits of code from the presentations?</p><p>Nope, the only mention is in the bottom right of the home page and it's to a site about awards being presented.</p><p>So I thought that maybe Labs would have something about the conference. Nope.</p><p>Adobe Communities? Nope.</p><p>It isn't even listed on the home page under events and seminars. I guess cs3 training is more important.</p><p>I finally found some current info on the MX site blog. But even at that site the home page doesn't give any indication that stuff is happening.</p><p>Come on Adobe, get your marketing hat on.</p></div>
