		<div class="comment_text"><p>I definitely agree that BioShock is one of the greatest games ever made, but it pales in comparison to Halo 3. Halo isn't about the campaign, it's about the multi-player. Halo has become a sport, larger than just a single video game.</p><p>While I played BioShock for about 20 hours (saving every little sister, getting every upgrade and listening to all the diaries), I can't even fathom how many hours I'll log in Halo3 (probably more that 1,000).</p><p>The campaign is much better on the higher levels. I played through heroic on launch night and I've been working my way through legendary piece by piece (all co-op). In all honesty, I got bored with the campaigns of the previous games never bother to finish them. The story is crap. In fact, it was 4 months after Halo 2 came out that I first tried the campaign (because XBoxLive was down for maintenance).</p><p>So yeah, Halo3 is really two games. Campaign and multiplayer. I'd say the campaign is a 90 out 100, but the multiplayer is a 99.</p><p>I'm outta town tonight, otherwise I'd group up with ya to pwn some n00bs.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm closer to Ray on this one.</p><p>* Bioshock is probably the best game ever made, on any platform. It has flaws: the splicers are awfully one-dimensional for such a layered game, the audio diary conceit could have been handled better, IMO, and the "bad" ending seems somehow more satisfying than the "good" version. (In a twisted way.) But the sound design and set pieces are amazing, the various combinations of plasmids and weapons are fun, and it just feels like the first complete gaming experience I've ever had.</p><p>* Halo 3 is very different. If you've spent a lot of time pondering the story from 1 and 2 (as I have), then 3 pays off pretty nicely. There's an incredibly dense and faceted fiction behind the Halo universe, and a lot of it is only suggested during actual gameplay. (There's a lot to be learned from the in-game terminals, but even that is intentionally murky.) Unfortunately for said gameplay, Bungie appears to have been a one-hit-wonder... they've never managed to design levels as blissfully organic and open as the first few from Halo 1, and Halo 3's High Charity level is only slightly less annoying than the infamous Library. I played Halo 1's camapign through probably 100 times, and Halo 2's at least twenty... but 3's will probably only get three play-throughs from me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bioshock was pure quality from start to finish, it's definitely the best single player FPS I've played this year :) Everything about it was finely polished, and my only disappointment was that the last level or two were over too fast and I found myself having completed the game but wanting to play more!</p><p>Having said that, and contrary to many others opinions, I really enjoyed the Halo 3 single player campaign as well. Compared to Halo 1 and 2 I think the attention to detail was there and the level design was much less repetitive - I didn't find myself getting lost at all?! - and the scale of the environments were just huge. I found that in the last half of the game the pace just got quicker and quicker and I put in a 5 hour stint on one occasion, right up to the second last level. I could have sworn the game was going to end a few times before it finally got there because the action was so intense for so long. So even from just the single player I felt like I got my money's worth, but multiplayer is indeed where it's at!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have just started playing both Bioshock and Halo 3 in the past week.  Both games are exceptional. However, I have to give the edge to Bioshock.</p><p>First, and I cannot believe I am gonna make this public, I cannot play Bioshock in the dark.  All the lights have to be on.  The first time I played, at some points in the game the hair on the back of my neck would stand up. The game play is real nice.  The graphics are incredible.</p><p>As for Halo, the graphic detail is stunning, maybe more so than Bioshock, but you know what?  I have played this game before, it was called Halo, or was it Halo 2, I can't remember. Now, I have not gotten very far in the game, but so far, aside from the graphics, I don;t really see much different between Halo 3 and its predecessors.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think we are living the same life.</p><p>I was playing Halo 3 &amp; Bioshock at the same time you posted this, I thought what is Ray talking about, Halo 3 rocks (and I don't play online no time). Bio Shock is also awsome and I love them both.</p><p>But I was mainly playing Halo as it was new, and was thinking how much fun it was, driving tanks, flying space craft, excellent. Then something totally unexpected happened. It finished, at first I was in disbelief, thinking no this is just a build up for something to follow.</p><p>But no, it was finished, no massive attack at the end or anything exciting. I think I completed this game in around 10 hours, which is very disapointing for the money, these games should be huge, 50+ hours of game play to finish. And I don't mean 50 hours of shooting, I mean of different levels etc. Even if that is using the same level (set) with a different mission or task, they did this a bit, but not enough.</p><p>Part of me thinks there is a motive of more mission packs, but that aint going to fly. I have probably already done 15+ hours in BioShock and don't think im near the end.</p><p>Plus Orange Box and others are coming that will surely entertain me. I think the Halo team need to rethink their strategy, not everyone plays online</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dale - I just want to ditto the Orange Box recommendation. Half-Life 2 + extensions, plus other games. It is absolutely the best bargain out there - and darn cool games at that.</p><p>Speaking of which - the Orange Box is on my wishlist. If anyone wants to pick up for 'review purposes', I promise to write a blog entry. ;)</p><p>FYI - spent more time this morning on Halo 3 MP, and I really really do enjoy it. The game has redeemed itself in my eyes - but the SP is still a disappointment.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was never a big First Person Shooter fan.  But Halo changed that.  How? Because it was different.  Because you could do more than juts walk, shoot and open doors.  Sad thing is all these years later, that all it still is.  I get the same feeling from Bioshock that I got from Halo all those years ago.  Yes, its still an FPS, but its so different than what is currently available its a breath of fresh air.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Scott</p><p>I'm right there with you. The first time a wrapped spider-slicer morphed from statue to killing machine (I don't play on "easy") I swear I screamed like a little girl. It was the one that is sitting facing the wall when you enter the corridor, you turn left, pick up a plasmid and BAM that thing filled my screen. Granted its a 52" DLP...but still.</p><p>@Ray</p><p>Bioshock is a far superior game. Why? Because like the box says, "No 2 players will have the same experience". I have talked with many people about how they completed various tasks and all of them had a different opinion. Some people pushed Plasmids to the level while others relied on the pistol for the whole game (this guy). Halo 3 is just a big stroke off. (Mind the french). Stupid AI Marines and repetitive point-shoot mechanics. The multiplayer is superior to many FPS mutliplayers out there but if thats all that Halo 3 is then why not package it like Shadowrun?</p><p>Halo 3 Campaign (solo):   5/10<br>Halo 3 Campaign (co-op):  7/10<br>Halo 3 Multiplayer:       9/10</p><p>Bioshock:                 10/10</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Both games have their flaws.  I'm with you and don't have a ton of time to play games, so I usually play them on easy.  I don't like getting frustrated.  Once I master a game and if I enjoyed it enough, I'll go back and play it on harder difficulties.</p><p>BioShock was truly original.  I was racing through the game too fast to figure out the different weapons.  I loved the level in the theatre.  Killing guys while listening to classical music felt like I was in a stylish movie.  BioShock wasn't really a shooter, more of a awesome visualistic story-teller.</p><p>With Halo 3, my brother and I are on the last level (just waiting to find time to finish it).  We've cruised through the game thus far.  I HATED the level inside the thing, really difficult to know where to go.  Halo was a great game, but they haven't made huge advancements to it.  I still really enjoy playing it, but for shooters gears of war, Rainbow Six Las Vegas really put you in the action more.</p><p>(my gamertag is matthewsteiner, I'll send you an invite)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK, I just spent about 3 hours playing MP with a former co-worker, and for a little bit, Ray, and it was a lot more fun than me just running around trying not to die.  But, to be honest, its not much different that Unreal Tournament from years ago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Ray and others here: BioShock is the first truly original game in a long time, esp in the FPS arena. I played through it twice back-to-back, just to try the "two possible paths", get every upgrade, listen to every tape, etc.</p><p>I am about halfway through H3 Campaign, and I am already bored. I will probably finish it, but it is barely keeping my attention at this point. Side Note: I have a dedicated home theater, with a killer HD projector, yet there appears to be little-to-no Anti-aliasing in H3. The angled lines on straight edges on the Pelicans look jaggy as heck...even during cut scenes. Is this a short-coming of the XB360, or the game? I have not noticed it this bad in any other game.</p><p>I can't wait for Assasins' Creed to come out on the 13th -- this is the first time in my life I have ever pre-ordered a video game (I mostly rent games for that matter). I sure hope it lives up to my expectations.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Last week, I finished H3 (only the 2nd FPS I ever finished) and I can tell you the end is a bore-fest.  The last hour or so is divvied into 2 parts (the Flood thing and the Warthog thing) that play over and over, offering little in the way of variety. It was quite annoying, and not very creative or engaging.</p></div>
