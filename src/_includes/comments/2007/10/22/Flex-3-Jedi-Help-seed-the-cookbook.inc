		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think this is a great idea. Me personally, I have nothing to add to the cookbook. As most of the stuff I write doesn't fall in to their categories. However, I have a couple of classes that I have written that I will be throwing up on Flexlib that will help a lot of people when it comes to error handling and dynamic endpoints.</p><p>I think it would be pretty cool to see some entries of the people I converse with on a daily basis. Lets see those entries people.</p></div>
