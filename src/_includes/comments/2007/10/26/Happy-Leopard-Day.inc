		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been waiting for the new version for a couple of months myself.  I have put off getting my first MAC until now so that I could get the new OS at the same time.  Hopefully, by Monday, I will have a couple of Windows machines that I've been using now for years ready for a community recycling.  Getting ready to pull some HD's and go get a great computer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I work in the printing industry and we DREAD the new OS releases.  The worse was back in the OS7 - OS9 days.</p><p>We tell all of our clients to sit on their hands until we test the new OS and can give our seal of approval.</p><p>When Apple comes out with a new OS it seems like they throw the old OS out the window and start from scratch.  So each version brings on it's own set of bugs ranging from network connectivity to software compatibility.</p><p>The network stuff has been the worse the last few releases.  We literally had files on network shares disappear because of the way the OS tracked files.  The 3rd party Macintosh file sharing software vendors had to scramble to make patches (Band-Aids) to try to prevent the problems until Apple got it fixed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't realize that if I preordered it would get here on release date.  Now that I've waited this long, I'll probably wait another month and see how smoothly (or not) everyone says the transition is.</p><p>I'm really relunctant to have any mishaps because I just spent so much time getting this one how I like it.</p><p>Of course, I'm also a little upset that I received it 10 days before Oct 1, when I could get it for $10. Now, I've got to come up with 130! I thought I read that I would get to upgrade a bit cheaper since even then we knew it was close to being released.  But, now I think that was about IntelliJ IDEA, not MacOSX</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I, too, am a new Mac user.  After attending MAX this year in Chicago, I noticed that about 3 out of every 5 laptops I saw in use were Macbooks.  Intrigued by this, I decided to spend some of my equipment budget, which I seem to be underrunning this year, to see what all the fuss was about so I purchased a 15" MacBook Pro with 4GB RAM.  I was hooked after about an hour.  This thing just works and it works well ALL the time.  What I was most impressed about was the fact that I could take my VM images (created on the PC version of VMWare) and run them in VMWare Fusion without modification.  I generally run two concurrent VM images.  They are both Windows 2003 servers.  One server runs IIS with CF8 (plus some other Windows services) and the other runs Exchange Server 2003 and serves as an Active Directory PDC.  This allows me to approximate my Windows production environment and use the new CFExchange* tags in CF8 without worrying about blowing up my production Exchange box.  I think I have arrived at an ideal development environment using this Mac.  Host and guest system performance on my Mac is FAR superior to the same environment on my Vista PC.  Memory management seems to be better and processor utilization is about 25% improved over the same development environment on my Vista box.  I love this thing.  Anyway....I received my Leopard DVD at about 10:30 yesterday and I was upgraded by lunch time (although I sort of cheated and skipped the DVD verification step which seemed to be taking an excessively long time to run).  Everything ran fine post upgrade....DreamWeaver, Flex 2, Flex 3, and, most importantly, VMWare Fusion and my VM images.  Also, Leopard seems to have introduced some new networking interfaces/utilities that make it easier to work in a Windows environment (admittedly, these tools may have existed in Tiger, but I have not been a Mac user long enough to have found them) and map network drives.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the upgrade.  If you have not played with TimeMachine yet, it's great technology.  The cover-flow file browser ain't bad either....</p><p>Good luck getting your native Mac apps running.  I'm sure we'll see solutions posted in the next couple of days.</p><p>M. McConnell</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray I hope that you will use your "contacts" inside Adobe to get a status of the problem and maybe convince them to work rapidly at addressing this problem</p><p>I know that there is some work in progress updating JRUN4 (updater 7) to "run with newer OS" as per Ben Forta. Maybe the solutions lies there !! I tried to apply for that beta testing round but no one got back to me. This is unfortunate because I know about the CF8 - Leopard problem for over a month now since I was getting the ADC builds....</p><p>With a late august build CF8 wouldn't even begin to boot... with a later build CF8 would start but fail mid way during the startup (with the error someone else mentionned above).</p><p>I plan to keep my production servers on Tiger for a LONG time, no rush there.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good to hear that CF 8 is running on Leopard. I was holding back from installing it here because I suspected that CF would not run. Any news from Adobe on this? Has anyone tried to manually configure the CF connnector in the Apache .conf files? Guess this is what I will try tonight after installing Leopard. Btw. - Ray, the layout of the add comments window looks rather strange in Safari.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Automator is basically AppleScript on steroids.  From what I understand, you can have Automator record what you're doing, and then create a script of your actions and you just click on the recorded script.  Apple has a page with examples you can download.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Automator is used to make repetitive tasks simple. For example, I have one setup to clean up and optimize images for the web, so when I drop photos in this folder it starts and opens up PS and crops them then sharpens them then moves them to another folder and they are ready for me.</p><p>In this particular case where you need to start jrun then open terminal and add the cfm start code, you could have automator record your actions and make a droplet on desktop and then if you have to reboot you can just click on the droplet and it will do it all.</p><p>Another example that I use is for making new site templates, it's nothing more that making folders and putting a few files in there like Application.cfc and styles.css but it saves tons of time.</p><p>Now that you can hit the record button it becomes really easy to do a lot of things, open up automator and look at all the example scripts it already has in it.</p><p>you can share them too<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fdownloads%2Fmacosx%2Fautomator%2F%3AHE7JhGucsiJGu_DfxFwxTmCTf5s&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/">http://www.apple.com/downlo...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray: I'm using Safari 2.0.4. This is what I get: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cielen.com%2Fdownload%2FrayBlogWindow.gif%3Aizqn7RwnQ4fs2eFhX6x6O3ieYwk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cielen.com/download/rayBlogWindow.gif">http://www.cielen.com/downl...</a> - if I resize the window and make it wider it gets a little better but the headlines still aren't located where they are supposed to be. I'll try again later with Safari 3.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I installed it last Saturday on an old 1.25 GHz G4 PowerBook and it runs faster. No doubt. With the new Aperture 1.5.6, it's actually useable again. Installed a day later on a separate partition on my Power Mac, no issues at all. Still running OS X 10.4.10 on our Apple XServe though, no need to be overly curious... ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finally made it work using the terminal commands provided by Scott P further up the thread.</p><p>I also found that if I close my terminal window after running this commands I kill cf, so I have to keep the terminal window opened. Not a big problem.</p><p>Did anyone manage to create an Automator app that would run these commands for you? I tried to dabble around in Automator a bit, but did not succeed.</p></div>
