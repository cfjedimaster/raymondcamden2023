		<div class="comment_text"><p>Even if a thread has been rejoined, and thus should not still exist, you can't create a new thread with the same name during the same page request.  I tried doing something like this:</p><p>&lt;cfloop from="1" to="5" index="i"&gt;<br>&lt;cfthread name="a"&gt;&lt;cfset b=1&gt;&lt;/cfthread&gt;<br>&lt;cfthread action="join" name="a"/&gt;<br>&lt;/cfloop&gt;</p><p>Silly, yes, but the point is that it doesn't work.  You get that same "threads must be unique" error, even though you can logically see that it should never be a problem.  Why thread scope is tied to request scope, I'm unsure.</p><p>Based on my own tests and what I've been told by Adobe support people, threads are magical things with their own scope-that-shall-not-be-named.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll take a look at that Ben. I seem to remember seeing something in the docs. Worst comes to worst - I'll scan and set to a 'real' date object. It will slow things down, but worth it for the proper sorting.</p></div>
