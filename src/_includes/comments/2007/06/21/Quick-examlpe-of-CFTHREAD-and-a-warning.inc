		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I'm not sure it's snappy. To me its simple. I mean two tags. Thats it!! And if you ignore my screw up, look at the performance gain. Awesome. (Ok, so I may be a bit _too_ excited about this.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What advantages or disadvantages does this have over using a asynchronous gateway? For instance, I use a gateway to process credit card transactions through <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fauthorize.net%3A-7UY1m4nPDFW3Qbn9bj1GTzZMhw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="authorize.net">authorize.net</a>. Before nightly billing would take about 15 minutes to process/respond/process/respond, etc. Since I wrote the gateway nightly billing now takes only about 15 seconds to complete. Is there really any difference in performance, or functionality between the two?</p><p>Jason<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%3ABiCYT10cKC4PzyWnvFopu2BhKwY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.lynda.com">http://www.lynda.com</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We have a conference call with Ben today, so I'll make sure and add that question to the list(of many!) questions that we already have for him. I am curious to see if the underlying architecture is different, or if cfthread is just a fansy way of doing a async gateway :)</p><p>Jason</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, in's Ben's own words async gateways are basically a hack :) The two systems have nothing in common and for most purposes cfthread should be used. I'm going to go play our entire conversation back at half speed so I can understand him a little better, that boy talks a mile a minute! lol..</p><p>Jason</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Let's also not forget that AsynGateways are Enterprise only, right? CFThread will be part of the core programming language and should be available to everyone. I have never been able to even play with Async gateways since I am on Standard.</p><p>@Ray, during the development process, it would probably be good to do a logging of some sort as the very last part of the CFThread body. I have done zero logging in my life, what might you recommend? CFLog? CFTrace? Something custom? I don't want to store to the system logs, just to a text file that I can monitor.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ben - I don't think you always need to log. In cases when you do a join (ie, "Ok, wait for all threads to end."), the proper thing then is to check the statuses of the threads.</p><p>In cases of 'fire and forget', and your question of cflog versus cftrace... I don't think one is any better than the other... although wait - cftrace won't work as the result gets added to the debug stack and you won't see it because you request ends before the thread does. So for -that- case, I'd definitely use CFLOG. And you want something like the Eclipse Log View thing which does a 'tail' on the logs and makes it easier to monitor log files.</p></div>
