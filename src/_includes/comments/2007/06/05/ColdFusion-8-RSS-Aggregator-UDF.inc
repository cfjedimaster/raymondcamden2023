I'll probably incorporate that into the RSS aggregator portlet we have in our portal system.</p><p>I wonder, though, what cffeed does when it tries to retrieve a feed that isn't currently available or parses one with malformed XML?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, have try to use paragator and work very fine, nice job, really. Let me ask why when parse more than one feed, their comes ordered by url and not by date as is determined in the last QdQ, so comes 7/8 feed of same url also many days old, and after another url with tomorrow news. Its pssible and where limit date only in past 24 hours, and or mix feed by date ?<br>this is sample of the test page that use paragator : <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informagorizia.it%2Fnewsfeed.cfm%3A-93O_EgQH1EKCl7Pm4ygHrJN6uw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.informagorizia.it/newsfeed.cfm">http://www.informagorizia.i...</a> .<br>I think you must sign on notes another pizza with great wine this time, next cfday in italy hope you come with ben</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not sure why. If you dump the query and it shows that it is order by [date], then it should be right. I ran the test from the download and it's working right.</p></div>
