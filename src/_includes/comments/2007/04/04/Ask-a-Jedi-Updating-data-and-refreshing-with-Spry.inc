		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray, I have managed to get the links working as you described above and in the referenced post. I am getting a problem with caching over the red and green images but am sure I will work through that. In the final bit of code where you reload all the data</p><p>dsData.url = "/index.cfm?event=xml.starbuckisntdead";<br>dsData.loadData();</p><p>would you just add a javascript random number to the end of the url.</p><p>Also is it possible to update just the row with the new information rather than relaoding all the data, or am I getting a we bit ambitious. Anyway really happy to be moving long with spry and should find plenty of uses for it.</p></div>
