		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nope. not like that at all. I want to edit a bunch of rows and send that back to the CFC. No where do I see a sample of how to update the DB like that. I have no problem using form fields and adding editing data in one row but to edit a bunch of records in the grid and send that seems impossible (I know its not) no one can seem to showm me. AND I HAVE BEEN ON THIS FOR MONTHS!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes.<br>My needs are a little more complicated, but I think just knowing how to edit a bunch of rows and press a submit button that would then add the rows to a db. would help</p><p>basically I have a query that brings in some data.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I'd suggest reading up more on Flash Remoting w/n Flex. This is how you would both get and send data. Sending data is just as simple as getting data, you just pass in the arguments. In you case, you would be sending the changed data.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Thanks for the response. I have read alot about remoting. I actually do have data records getting added to a db table. If you checked out my app. There is a grid that has a column of check boxs. below that is a "program area" this is whats going on in a peticular group (the accounts checked) of accounts. So a user selects some accounts then adds the program information at the bottom then send. What I get in my DB.table is the program information. Works Great! My big problem is that I cannot seem to get the checked accounts. So that a record in the DB.Table would contain the account number from the grid and the program info. The next record that has a check would contain a different account number from the grid and the same program info. and so on... Not sure if you can help me with this, but since you are responding and I have considered you one of the CF greats (I think I even took a class from you a long time ago)I better see what I can learn. Thanks George</p></div>
