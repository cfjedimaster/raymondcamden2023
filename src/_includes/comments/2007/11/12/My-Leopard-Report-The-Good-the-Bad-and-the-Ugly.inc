I too installed Leopard  on a 17" Mackbook Pro in the hours after the launch  and the machine has been rock solid so far.</p><p>My Macbook Pro has been through all possible states (on, off, sleep, reboots, AC, battery, etc.) many time without an itch..</p><p>Good luck having your machine repaired.</p><p>Yves</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been posting my own thoughts over the last few days (I just upgraded Friday night) and some are similar, so I'll piggyback on your post to see if your (much larger :-) readership has seen a problem I've noticed with Spaces.</p><p>First, though, terminal.  Tabs are great, but still no bookmarks.  For that reason alone, I'm sticking with iTerm.  I can't remember all of those passwords...</p><p>Like you, I've never monkeyed with Time Machine.  The fact that it can't backup to a network server kind of kills it.  I don't want to go out and buy a new device that I have to tether to my laptop when I have a perfectly good (and beefy) server sitting 10' away from me.</p><p>Now, back to spaces.  If I have Firefox open in one space and anything else open in another, I can't Command+Tab from the other app to Firefox and have the FF window accept the focus.  The application is focused, but not the window.  In the same space, I can Command+Tab, F5 after making a change to refresh my page.  In different spaces, I have to click on the window before F5 does anything.</p><p>Anyone else seen this?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So far I'm liking Leopard.  I'm finding that it runs faster on my lowly Aluminum PB4.  Safari is better than before (although there are still some sites that work better in FireFox).  I really like the Web Inspector that you can get via Debug menu (any way ColdFire can hook into Web Inspector?).  I can even have several browser windows open with several tabs without getting the beach ball all the time.</p><p>Time Machine is good, although I don't like having to go over and plug it into the drive so Time Machine can do its thing. I still am going to be backing up on a second drive once in a while, in case the Time Machine drive goes south.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Rob--you can backup using Time Machine to another machine, so long as it's running Leopard. ;-) Granted, this is a pain. I'd love to be able to backup to the hard drive I have plugged into my Airport, and apparently this support is coming soon. Rumor is that it was in there until the last minute and they pulled it our right before the release. At this point I'm backing my MacBook up to the MiniStack I have plugged into my Mac Mini and it's working great.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Matt -</p><p>I didn't realize that, but in the end it doesn't matter.  I don't have another Mac (unfortunately).  For my purposes, I won't use Time Machine until it can backup to any mountable volume.  SuperDuper can do it.  I expect Time Machine to do it as well before it will be useful to me.</p><p>Maybe this is a good excuse to buy an inexpensive Mac...  :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Rob,</p><p>The reason Time Machine won't back up to any network drive is because Time Machine currently requires HFS+ for the file system.  Hooks were added in in order to get Time Machine to work.  I'm waiting for Time Machine to support ZFS myself.  I'd love to get some network storage that was using ZFS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Rob,</p><p>HFS+ is Apple's file system.  Its getting long in the tooth and they plan on replacing it at some point.  They've made major updates to it in Tiger and Leopard.  They added the features to it to allow Spotlight to work in Tiger.  And now they've added features to get Time Machine to work.  There is a very thorough explanation of how it all works in this awesome review of Leopard by John Siracusa:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Freviews%2Fos%2Fmac-os-x-10-5.ars%3AX4ot43CwawEekxr8PCqOUPg7Uvo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars">http://arstechnica.com/revi...</a></p></div>
