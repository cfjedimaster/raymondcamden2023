		<div class="comment_text"><p>We used to get something similar for scheduled tasks awhile back, but that was v7 not v8. When we removed all scheduled tasks and set them back up from scratch it went away. I remember a hotfix in v7 that dealt with scheduled tasks timing too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - Are your scheduled tasks "Recurring Daily" tasks or "Daily every..." tasks?  We've had scheduled tasks before that would just start running at strange times.  According to the task log it appeared they were getting scheduled for these extra runs, though we could never determine why.</p><p>It seems to have only happened for the "Daily every..." tasks.  Since your email is once a day, I assume it would be a "Recurring Daily" task, but thought I'd mention it.</p><p>As DK mentioned, we've seen this in v7.</p></div>
