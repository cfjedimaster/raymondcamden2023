How rude to assume that we want to be subjected to the same advert on *every* page request. Just thinking about that makes me angry.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it's okay...but I really kind of want something more..</p><p>First off, it is very different from the traditional "F" logo. And I only think the logo is useful if they plan to keep that shape as a symbol. If they change it in the next version - then it's uber-stupid.</p><p>That said, I am a bit corny. But I kind of want to see an "Earth, Wind, Fire, Water" them.</p><p>Adobe AIR = Wind, take the object and make it look like it's windy.</p><p>As for the other's, I haven't completely worked them out. *lol*</p><p>Flash = Fire or it could equal Water (Flash Flood).<br>Flex = Water (fluid, flexible, etc)<br>ColdFusion = Water (cold fusion, heavy water, etc) or perhaps Earth.</p><p>But I guess we should all just be grateful that Adobe AIR did not get named "Flair". :P</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm just trying to figure out the what is hiding behind the logo such that it produces that shadow.  (The shadow around the bright spot for what I presume is the hole does not rejoin on the left.)</p><p>I think Mike's next job should be to make an AIR app where you can grab and twist the logo to see what is back there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andrew: Sys-Con's obsession with audio content is the main reason I hesitate to go to their site. Well, plus, I just don't like the way it's designed. But the audio/video! Arg! I've always wondered why it's taken so long for them to realise nobody likes it... $$.</p></div>
