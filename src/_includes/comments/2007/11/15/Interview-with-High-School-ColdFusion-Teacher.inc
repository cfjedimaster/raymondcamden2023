		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's something Adobe could do. Make some of the current training materials available to user groups and the education space. We put on a full-day hands-on Flex coding day this past year, in large part due to the availability of good hands-on training materials from Adobe. The user groups now have access to "Flex training in a box". I've been working with Ed Sullivan to find similar hands-on training materials to put a multi-track hands-on training day with CF but there appears to be some difficulty getting approval for their materials to be used that way. Additionally it does no appear the courses other than Fast Track have been updated to CF8 yet (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Ftraining%2Finstructor_led%2F%29%3AINpRo4qNCL8dkGc0i_-LdW5U_08&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/training/instructor_led/)">http://www.adobe.com/traini...</a>.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is great to hear that a high school is teaching ColdFusion! I have a similar story. I learned ColdFusion (it was 4.5 back then) in college at the University of North Dakota (UND). This class was through the Information  Systems department in the business college. As far as I know this is still taught. This class prepared me for my internship (which I only got because of my CF knowledge) and then for my career. I have been using ColdFusion for seven years now and am loving it! Adobe should bring their products into schools and introduce students to them. That way, when students enter the work force, not only are they more skilled, but they already know (and like) Adobe products.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The one student Ben says he probably won't pursue CF and talks about a degree in politics and history. Well, my undergrad work is in Political Science. And I am a full-time CF developer. So ... perhaps it's too early to rule it out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Why do people keep hanging onto the thought that CFML = XHTML?"</p><p>I don't think that's what was being said. What was being said from what I could tell is that too many of the fancy code generating features don't generate xhtml compliant output, and that's something that's been nagging me as well. They're still running CF7 and a lot of the cfform and charting stuff for example does not output valid xhtml. I haven't checked if this has been addressed in CF8 though.<br>Sure, you can just not use it, but that kind of erodes some of the high profile selling points of later CF versions.</p></div>
