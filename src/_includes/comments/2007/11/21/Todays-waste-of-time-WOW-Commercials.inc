		<div class="comment_text"><p>YES!  Another person who was once addicted to MUDs.. I'm was not the only one.  *aCk*</p><p>.. I can't believe Blizzard allowed this stuff ;P  I've enjoyed their commericals.. and WoW in itself is just as addicting as a MUD.  To be honest, MUDs and WoW is only as addicting if your friends play with you.. if not, I think it'd get rather boring quickly.</p><p>(ok, I'm a nerd)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Allowed? They are official commercials. Or do you mean - signed off on the ad agency's work? :)</p><p>MUD: At my college there was quite a large contingent of mudders. Every night you can find a large group playing. I also became a coder on multiple MUDs as well. I played primarily at Kobra and Everdark. Actually - the coding I did at Everdark is probably the code I'm most proud of - even more than any CF code I've written. I created a framework for my realm that added time, and timed based events. I also had NPCs with interactive conversations.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know.. more money for Blizzard.. :P</p><p>It's amazing how popular MUDs were in college.  All thanks to gopher!  I would never have known about them, if it wasn't for that.  I never really coded for one, I started to.. but then sorta drifted away after graduation.  I played on Infinity ...  mostly addicted to LPMuds.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You're doing well to stay away from WoW, Ray. I used to play *a lot* but only play very occasionally nowadays. It's an incredibly addictive game and there are a few of my friends who really want to play it but know that if they do, they can write off a lot of their spare time straight away. Not buying the game is the safest option :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ah, genious. It's always fun to mix work and play and chatting about social computer games on an ostensibly CF blog :)</p><p>I got addicted to MUDs back in the day, for exactly the reasons mentioned above, the social factor. You got to really know people when all you did was type at them in a darkened terminal room at 2am.. cough, ahem. moving on.</p><p>I do play WoW nowadays, pretty much for the same reasons, catching up with the friends I've met in the game as well as people I know from real life I've talked into installing possibly the bulkiest IM client I know.</p><p>Now if only we could hook an event gateway up to the in-game chat, then one's servers could yell at you when they're in need of attention.</p></div>
