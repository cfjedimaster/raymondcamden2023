		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, as Chris says, they will tell you to detach the HDD and faceplate (if you have a custom one) and send back the bare box only. All your saved games should be safe :)</p><p>I had to send mine in for repair about 12 months ago when I got hit by the RRoD. The turnaround time for mine was just 6 working days, and I got it back just in time for the Gears of War release.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My son just got the ring of death on our 360 this weekend. My 5 year old was playing Halo 3 when it happened and his entire profile was either deleted form teh HDD or corrupted to the point where it doesnt show up in the list. Thats about 10 months worth of him playing that he lost. He was so upset about it.</p><p>You guys know who to contact about sending it in? Its less than a year old now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 360 PSU died on Saturday. I'd only just turned it on and there was loud cracking sound, probably caused by something arcing inside the unit. After that the console wouldn't power on. I'm going to buy a new PSU from eBay though, as it's cheaper than getting mine repaired (plus I don't want to be without my Xbox during December)!</p></div>

My back usb had died about 2 months ago and when I called then they wanted to charge me - but now it's all free.</p><p>The sad news is that the turn around time is 3-4 weeks. :( A whole month w/o my xbox.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My 360 got the Red Rings of Death a couple of weeks ago. Fortunately, I bought the 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy (I bought before Microsoft went to the 3yr warrant.)</p><p>Anyway, the great thing is I was able to take the 360 in to my local Best Buy and they swapped units out right there in the store. I was able to pull my Hard Drive off and swap it with the unit in the store.</p><p>Since it's a new unit, I get HDMI output and the newer cooling system.</p><p>The topper to the whole deal is, BestBuy for some reason gave me a refund since the price had dropped. I ended up getting a new 360 and $40 gift card. Pretty nice!</p><p>I won't buy extended store warranties on all items, but for any game console I definitely think it's a must. Especially with all these units that run hot (XBOX, PS3, etc.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What do you think about the 360 Elite Ray? Today I came home and got the 3 rings of death! I'm sending it back to Microsoft to get fixed but from what Ive been hearing about the Elite being less noisy, cooler and better with the HDMI out I'm thinking about picking one up and selling the old one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So far so good. As I said, the only real disappointment was that MS didn't include the hard drive cable kit and made no mention of it in the docs (not that I saw). I have no idea when Ill get the cable, but, I'll give MS props for making it easy to swap out drives.</p></div>
