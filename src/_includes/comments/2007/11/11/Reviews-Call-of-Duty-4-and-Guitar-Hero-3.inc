		<div class="comment_text"><p>I only briefly played GH2, so I don't really have a comparison, but I do LOVE GH3.  We have it for the Wii, and I spend a little too much time with it.  Have you done the final battle yet?  That's a real kick in the pants.  :)</p><p>I agree with you about the graphics.  When you get a new character, or change guitar styles...I never really see that stuff because you have to pay so close attention to the notes.  And I WAS very disappointed to find out that a new guitar doesn't really do anything.  I saved up to buy a $10,000 guitar because I thought it would give me some kind of bonus...</p></div>

It's one of those games where I don't care about the depth, but the challenge of trying to get through it.  I've completed easy and am 3/4 of the way through medium, and I found the difficulty to ramp up pretty quickly.  I also like how the playing becomes more accurate to the actual guitar playing as you step up in difficulty.  Since I play the guitar casually anyway, it's nice to see that.  Oh, and the boss battles do get harder, and the Dragonforce song you open up on beating easy is hard to complete on easy (and I'm not sure I want to try it any harder).  Great game all around!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Massive fan of COD4.  I played the beta none stop right up to the second they took the beta servers offline.  First day I got the release copy I played it from straight after work until after 8am the next morning.</p><p>One of the cool things in the single player game is the focus on fun and the gamer experience and not the game length.  The single player isn't that long, but it is just so much fun.  Loved the "Death from above" level!</p><p>Cool feature in the single player is how the game adapts if you are having trouble reaching a checkpoint.  Keep dying over and over at a certain point from too many enemies?  After dying a few times, the number of enemies will slightly reduce...keep dying and it will get a little bit easier (just in that section of the level).  If only more games would do this.</p><p>Multiplayer? Makers of Halo 3, MOH Airborne etc should take a look at what Infinity Ward have done with COD4 for a lesson in how to make a good multiplayer game.  Quick connection to matches (most of the time anyway), quick intense game play and the constant feeling of “just one more game, I promise”</p><p>Brilliant Game! 10/10</p><p>Cheers<br>Mark<br>(xboxlive:  tHeSmUrF300)</p></div>

A cool feature for COD5 would be the ability to have that style of gameplay in multiplayer (so 10 kills without dying and you get 10 seconds of that style).</p><p>When you start playing multiplayer, kiss any work your doing goodbye...so maybe get blogCFC 6 out the door first :)</p></div>

If you haven't tried it most Best Buys have a pre-release with drums, mic and guitar setup.  Basically it is Guitar Hero but with a whole band at the same time (online or all together).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>New website?  Nice!</p><p>I also own and have played both games.  I kept hearing that COD4 was the best shooter, better than Halo, better than Gears of War, better than Rainbox Six, better than BioShock.  You're right the level detail is amazing and the level immersion is amazing, but without a duck and cover system this game is simply good instead of excellent.  How can games like Halo 3, Bioshock, and COD4 not include such a critical feature.  It's the next evolution in FPS games.  It's what shooting is all about!</p><p>Rainbox Six still wins the crown for best shooter game because of the cool weapons and realism.  That game can be incredible tough and slow though so maybe not as fun for some people.</p><p>COD4 you can tell is still a COD game.  You are led in a linear path and you just run around a shoot, not too much strategy required.  I love the game still, but I kinda regret buying the game when I think I won't play it once I beat it.</p><p>Bioshock's wins the award for most unique and innovative for the year.</p><p>Halo 3 is just more of the same, great game, but they didn't really expand much of the single player campaign which is mostly what I play.  I like the music in that game so much though, that I just get jazzed up playing it.</p><p>Sorry this comment has turned into random thoughts. See you online.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>WOW! I am LOVING Assassin's Creed. I have killed 7 of the 9 main targets, and I still love the game. But I love "sneaking" games like Splinter Cell, and I love a good sword fight. Of course I also loved Prince of Persia, and AC is by the same team.</p><p>I will wait to read Raymond's full review to comment further, but I can see why this game is not for everyone though. I think everyone can agree the graphics, animation, sound, and scenery is incredible. Gamespot gave a 9 out of 10 - Editor's Choice, and others have praised it equally high. Can't wait to hear what you have to say about it, Ray, because so far our tastes have been scarily similar.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would have to agree, animation, graphics etc are great in Assassin’s Creed...but I really don't like this game that much.  I want my $109 back.</p><p>I’ve only played the game for about 8 or 9 hours, but it seems very repetitive and hearing the people around the city (and the people you save) say the same thing over and over really gets annoying.  Come on Ubisoft, would it really be that hard to add a few more phrases?  Games that force me to listen to the slow dribble that some of the characters spew forth, really annoy me.</p><p>But yes, it does look good and some of the kill scenes are very impressive. I love jumping at my target with the hidden blade and smacking them to the ground, or the fight move where you put your short sword in their foot and then as they bend over, come up and smack them in the head.....looks cool.  But good graphics, animation  and sound don’t make a great game.  It’s a pity they didn’t spend just a little more time on it as it is so close to being a brilliant game.  Voice acting isn’t that great either.</p><p>Have you seen the change list for the COD4 upgrade?</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infinityward.com%2Fcommunity%2Fforum%2Findex.php%2Ftopic%2C3042.0.html%3A2V1rECgnHduY25qKwmQ6VxjNFac&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.infinityward.com/community/forum/index.php/topic,3042.0.html">http://www.infinityward.com...</a></p><p>There isn’t much I don’t like about COD4 Multiplayer, and now pretty much everything is being fixed!  I think COD4 would have to be one of my most favourite games ever.  I’ll give AC a couple more days to grow on my, but after that I’m going back to COD4.</p><p>Cheers<br>Mark</p></div>
