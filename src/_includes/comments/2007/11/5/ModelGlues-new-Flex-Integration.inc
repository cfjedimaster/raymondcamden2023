		<div class="comment_text"><p>This looks to be great stuff,</p><p>I've been playing around with Model-Glue for a little while now and really am falling in love, Flex is somthing I've also wanted to explore for some time so this lends its hand nicely to my requirements, I'll definatly be playing around with it a little more.</p><p>However, I'm interested to know the differeance between MG:U and MG:Flex... if U now does this Flex stuff, then what is the Flex version for? Is it purely a framework for the UI side of things?</p><p>Thanks for the heads up on this Ray,</p><p>Rob</p></div>
