		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just got around to watching the CF8 Ajax presentation.</p><p>What a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours. I really feel like I'm up to speed now with the functionality that CF8 provides in this area and how I can use it on a big project I am about to embark on. I can see this speeding up my admin development massively!</p><p>Oh and &lt;cfajaxproxy&gt;!!! Yes, I can really see why you say it's almost as important as CFDUMP.. Within 1 minute of your intro on it I was thinking WOW! When you look at it, it is essentially (or at least one part of it is) a client side version of CreateObject(). You setup the proxy call, then instatiate your CFC object in JS and boom - you have access to all the methods. Incredible.</p><p>Thanks again for the presentation Ray. You have a really great style which makes things very easy to understand.</p><p>I'm off to start playing with it all now.</p><p>To save my searching, have you got a link to the source code you used?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the link.</p><p>Ah, your too modest Ray. Your presentation style is very engaging, the examples you used are to the point and clear, yet your flexible enough to adapt to comments as you go along.</p><p>Compared to some presenters who talk like they should be on prozak your a pro. :)</p></div>
