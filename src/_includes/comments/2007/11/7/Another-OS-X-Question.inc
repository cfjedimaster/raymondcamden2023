		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey, I had this problem, and I think I solved it. On my machine, it was .sql files: Finder opened them with QuickTime, and did not want to Change All to TextWrangler, just like you described. What I did was create a file dummy file (in Terminal: touch dummy.sql). Finder accepted to Change All when working on that one.</p><p>The files I was struggling with were all output from a web application, saved from Firefox. I don't know, but that may be a clue - wouldn't happen to be a common denominator to your problem, would it?</p><p>Anyway, hope that helps.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Alas, my files reverted to opening with QuickTime after I-don't-know-what stimulus. Digging deeper, I found the problematic files have the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute set. I have gotten the xattr utility from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxattr.darwinports.com%2F%3AGzE1cA92vEvqawxhD5E6s45tdAI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://xattr.darwinports.com/">http://xattr.darwinports.com/</a> , and here's the output for one troublesome file:</p><p>% xattr -l sqldump.sql<br>sqldump.sql<br>        com.apple.FinderInfo    BINAhDmp</p><p>The file is a dump from phpMyAdmin saved with Firefox. Files like this, although I have done "Get Info", "Open With", "Change All" with Finder, will not open with my text editor like I want them to. When I save similar files with for example Safari, the FinderInfo attributes are not set, and Finder correctly hands them to my preferred application for .sql files. I located the association in LaunchServices:</p><p>% defaults read com.apple.LaunchServices | grep sql -B2 -A4<br>        }, <br>        {<br>            LSHandlerContentTag = sql; <br>            LSHandlerContentTagClass = "public.filename-extension"; <br>            LSHandlerIgnoreCreator = 1; <br>            LSHandlerRoleAll = "com.barebones.textwrangler"; <br>        },</p><p>So, it seems, although Change All updates the LaunchServices association (I deleted it and checked; it does), this is not respected for files with the FinderInfo string (which I interpret as old-school creator/type attributes?) set. Removing the FinderInfo makes the file work like I want it to:</p><p>% xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo sqldump.sql</p><p>So it seems this is a double bug - Firefox wrongly types the file because it doesn't recognize the extension, and Finder doesn't honor the user preference under these conditions.</p></div>
