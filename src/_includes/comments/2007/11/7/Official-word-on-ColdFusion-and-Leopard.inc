		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah. Sure. Four months later and still no fix from Adobe. I don't believe anything they say. I'm looking for another development platform. Ruby, Python are good choices. Dump Coldfusion. It's evident that Adobe couldn't care less about continuing Mac OS support of Coldfusion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Eh? To be clear - if you are on Tiger, CF runs fine. CF's Leopard support is included in the next version, which also has other major updates, so this isn't just a minor patch they can release quickly. Adobe hasn't lied. The new version is in development right now. I'm running it (technically I'm not supposed to say that).</p></div>
