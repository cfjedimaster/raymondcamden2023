		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Vader figure case can't be TOO old, because if it is, then that makes me REALLY old, and I refuse to admit that the stuff I played with as a kid is old. So there you go. <br>You showed a copy of the first book next to a Vader Pez dispenser, and this one is hanging with stormtroopers. Do you have any good guys? I'd think the ColdFusion Jedi would want his book with Yoda or Mace or some other Master, but that's just me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dan: Have you watched Ray's superb presentation on the AJAX functions in CF8? I was really blown away by how extensive and cool the support is. CFAjaxProxy is amazing - almost like a CreateObject for the client side, but linked to server side components.. So cool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@James: Yeah I saw Ray's presentation. It got me jumpstarted down the CF Javascript and AJAX road. I don't quite understand CFAjaxProxy yet, which is one reason I'm dying to see the book! I've been very successful using most of the other things Ray discussed though. I'm getting some pretty nice results on my forms. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Dan: Nice one on putting it into action. I think the more you delve into the features and using them you'll get a real grasp of the power they provide. I can see myself using them extensively on a big project I'm about to start. Looking at Ray's DB Explorer shows how easy it is to knock together really usable admin style applications with ease.</p><p>As far as I could tell, I think it's good idea to think of cfajaxproxy as a client side CreateObject. I.E. You instantiate the CFC on the client side, like you would on the server side and then access the relevant methods (access="remote" ones) as you would in Coldfusion.</p><p>The awesome power here, I think, is that you can code your CFC to work on the server side once, but then utilise it on the client side without any extra work - apart from the JS functions to call the CFC methods.. Absolutely fantastic!</p><p>Ray, please correct me if I've misunderstood this feature. I've not had a chance to use it yet, but I definitely had one of those 'wow' moments during your presentation. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>James - Yes, I think that is a good analogy (client side createObject), but don't forget cfajaxproxy also has that 'other' mode that I like to call &lt;cfbind&gt;.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the explanation guys.</p><p>I think a whole chapter of the CFWACK could have been dedicated to the various uses of the Bind feature alone. It's popping up everywhere and is taking a little creativity to figure out how to best utilize it. (I'll soon be seeing how many entries are listed for 'bind' in the index of volume 2 ;-) I could have used it in the example I was working on here:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dsoren.com%2F2007%2F11%2F29%2Foff-topic-coldfusion-8-cftree-cfwindow%2F%3AG5be-YYgsUaPMU4q8d7weqQcsno&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.dsoren.com/2007/11/29/off-topic-coldfusion-8-cftree-cfwindow/">http://blog.dsoren.com/2007...</a></p></div>
