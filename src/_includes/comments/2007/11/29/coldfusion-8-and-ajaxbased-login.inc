		<div class="comment_text"><p>A general question Ray - what's the browser compatibility like with this and with the CF8 Ajaxy goodness in general? And how does it degrade if a user has javascript disabled? Just wondering if it would be a good idea to do a quick check to see if javascript is enabled and browser compatibility before using this method.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Will,</p><p>I have found that there are not too many people that disable JavaScript these days. Here are some statistics from the last 30 days on the most popular site I work on:</p><p>JavaScript enabled:<br>Yes - 309,475 visitors - 99.44%  <br>No - 1,756 visitors -  0.56%</p><p>And a lot of those people that didn't have JavaScript enabled were people browsing on their blackberry's and such.</p><p>But then again, at our current conversion rate and average order value, those 1,756 people per month could represent about $12,000 in sales so that would make it well worth my effort to make sure they could browse my site easily without javascript, even though they should be paying attention to their driving and not shopping online with their phone =)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Are you sure? Spry _can_ do this obviously. It has a way to send form data, although I don't believe it does a whole form scope like CF's does. Spry does not have a Window UI though. So I don't think you are right - but if you have a URL, I'd love to see it. As you know, I love Spry as well. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray...</p><p>This looks great and appears to be clear as mud until I try to run it in CF8.  I have a js alert in begining of my handleResponse function which tells me the value of "s" (either good or bad passed from the processlogin.cfm).  Trouble is, although I can see the value is being passed correctly (i.e s=good) it never logs me in as the js function does not seem to be treating "s" as a string...or something?</p><p>Any ideas please?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm afraid I don't quite get your comment. If the response is "good", it means your login worked, and the session variable stores the results. That is how I did the 'login' for this demo. Your security system may be different. If your security system uses some other method to mark a user logged in, then you would need to modify my demo code. Does that make sense?</p><p>Or are you saying the result of s "looks" to be good, but the stuff in the s=="good" portion isn't running? If so, I'd consider using Firebug and debugging the result. You can use console.log(s) to see the value.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just getting my head round the whole Ajax thing, and this helped thanks.</p><p>I was tinkering with things and trying to learn more, so I have modified your script so that if the login fails, it runs a cfajaxproxy instance to a cfc to count the number of failed logins and returns the "x failed logins" to the login window and updates a div. This works beautifully, but the code only runs on a form submit event.</p><p>So what I was wanting to do was also run the code just after the coldfusion.window.create code as well, but this fails, I think because I would need to run it after some sort of ready event. Is there such a thing available when using the inbuilt coldfusion.window.create function?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>I am looking into the FW/1 Framework and was wondering how I might incorporate this into the framework? I can't seem to get the good to return to the function, so I can't log in. Any ideas?<br>I am really new to frameworks, and from what I have read (on your blog and others), this framework might be the best to use to start understanding frameworks.<br>thanks for the help<br>Dan</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, remember, a framework, like a normal CFML file, returns data. Period. It can be HTML. It can be plain text. Or whatever. But (in general), its just text data. You should be able to build a FW/1 request that only returns "good". This is no different than a request that returns a crap load of HTML.</p><p>Does that make sense?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am probably doing this all wrong but I am learning.<br>In my views folder I have a login folder with the login.cfm and processlogin.cfm pages. on the default.cfm page I run the cfwindow tag that will pop open the window with the source of the cfwindow tag being: index.cfm?action=login.login.<br>on the login.cfm page I have my fields for id and pass. I submit using your js call to the function that does the submitForm. I have this and all my javascript calls on my default.cfm page in my layouts folder.<br>This is where I have my issue. It runs the submitform (i think), and is suppose to call handleResponse js when it is done (this also on the default.cfm page in layout folder). It seems to call the function, however the variable of good is set on the processlogin.cfm page and I don't really know how it can be used in the response js.</p><p>I am having a hard time getting my head around controllers, services, layout, etc. and how data passes. Also, I have not done a lot of cfscripting, and alot of the code you all are writing now is in cfscript...it is taking me a while to convert that over in my head.</p><p>Anyway, thanks first for blogging about this framework, would not have known about it if not. Also thanks for any help you can give me...<br>The more example code from anyone using this framework would be great for not only me, but for anyone else that wants to check out FW/1.</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>Dan</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan, I would _strongly_ urge you to start more slower in FW/1. Before you start mixing Ajax into it, get a bit more comfortable with FW/1 in general. Know what I mean? I'm a big believer in baby steps. :)</p></div>
