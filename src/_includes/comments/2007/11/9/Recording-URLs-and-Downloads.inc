You could also do quick movies that you could make available as podcasts for free.  Free advice but I want 10% per order if you go with my idea. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray: Your Spry preso mentioned tantalizingly about automatic data refresh and caching, but you didn't demonstrate any examples.  I rolled my own data refresh for a project recently, but, if Spry can handle it internally (without my crufted together javascript), I would love to know more about it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To enable automatic data refreshing (paste from docs):</p><p>Data sets can reload their data at a specified interval expressed in milliseconds. This can be handy when the data at a given URL changes periodically.<br> To tell a data set to load at a given interval, pass the optional loadInterval option when calling the XMLDataSet constructor:</p><p>// Load the data every 10 seconds. Turn off the cache to  make sure we get it directly from the server.<br>var dsPhotos = new  Spry.Data.XMLDataSet("/photos.php?galleryid=2000", "/gallery/photos/photo", { useCache:  false, loadInterval:<br>10000 });</p><p>To disable cache, again, use the useCache option, which you see in the code above. Note - IE seems to be anal about caching. In the past I've had to add a randomness to my URLs. Check out lighthousepro for an example.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the pointer, Ray.  A little bit after I posted, I looked up the auto refresh in the Spry API and found what I was looking for - a way to programmatically turn on and off the refresh interval.</p><p>ds.startLoadInterval(10000);<br>ds.stopLoadInterval();</p><p>Very handy to toggle refresh on and off.</p></div>
