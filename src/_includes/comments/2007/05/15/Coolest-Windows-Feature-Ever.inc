		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another one to try is Robocopy, it's actually part of the Windows Resource Toolkit and you can download it for free. It's about the best file copy tool out there for windows... it's command line, but it has about a gagillion options including, retries, logging, mirroring, etc. I use it to keep my backup drive synched with my laptop and it works wonderfully. You can tell it to ignore any errors (which are usually only caused by system files in use) and it does read-only files without a problem.. Plus it's much faster than trying to do it in explorer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, Ray, I think you're missing the much cooler feature in Windows when copying files. It's complete awesome when you are trying to copy a whole bunch of files and one of them fails to move for some reason (like you didn't realize that Word failed to close fully, and so it's still holding the file open), which of course means that we actually wanted to stop the entire process, instead of continuing to copy the rest of the files, and of course, since Windows also copies files in an apparently random order, you now have no way to tell which files have moved and which haven't, so you try to move the whole directory over and give yourself carpal tunnel by having to click "No" about a thousand times to keep it from wasting time copying the files that succeeded last time, and because in the wonderful usability testing done in Redmond, "Yes to All" is essential, but "No to All" would just be crazy.</p></div>

Frankly, I use Macs from time to time and I find a lot frustrating about them, but I also understand it's my lack of knowledge with the OS that makes it so difficult for me to use. I don't blame the OS, I blame me.</p><p>So basically, it's frustrating to see so many folks making a what is a pretty decent product out to be such a piece of shit when it really isn't.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>TJ,</p><p>I think what a lot of poeple (myself included) are complaining about is that these simple things have not been fixed, in many revisions of windows. Instead of re-writing core windows functions for speed / usability, they plop on more eye-candy and a host of new incompatabilities.  This leaves their long time user base in the lurch with many of the same problems the software always had.  I think if we make enough noise, maybe they will get fixed.</p><p>Chris</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bah, I'm with TJ, most of these gripes with Windows can be put down to lack of knowledge or have trivial solutions which I'm sure OS X users would be only to quick to point out if it were about their precious OS :P</p><p>Prompts are necessary before read-only files are moved because moving a read-only file is just as potentially disastrous as changing it. Same goes with system files. Same goes with files that are in use, or files that already exist at the destination location! Blindly moving files in those situations and having the OS pick the right answer every time is impossible! It Ray's case, yeah it's annoying if the prompts are spread out across a file operation that takes hours, but I have a feeling Vista has addressed this somewhat, particularly where a file is in use and cannot be moved you can now skip the file and the whole move operation won't crap out like it did in XP.</p><p>Windows XP's start menu can be sorted by right clicking on it and choosing 'Sort by name'. Windows Vista's start menu always stays sorted by name (as are folder views on the local file system).</p><p>'No to all' can be done by shift-left clicking on 'No'.</p><p>There needs to be some kind of super wiki so that every time someone has a "Stupid Windows can't do X" they can look it up and get a real answer, rather than spreading more misinformation (like the No to All one which has been around for almost 10 years, since Windows 98).</p><p>Instead of flaming the other OS (not pointing at you Ray), I like to see solutions or workarounds, or at least civil discussion which so far this thread has almost provided :)</p></div>
