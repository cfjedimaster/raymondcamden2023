		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to review my little app. Some really useful constructive criticism and definitely points i will take on board for the future. (I'm relieved it didn't get trashed, hehe)</p><p>I did have a bunch of images but pulled them coz they where all infringing on copyright...maybe I'll make it look nicer in version 2!</p><p>Cookie use with wddx was something i don't use often but i really wanted to stay away from database stuff to make it as easy as possible to transport. Is it acceptable to risk the cookie size limit thing for an application where you know the data will normally be so small?</p><p>I've not come across your point about caching the cfc in the application scope before but it makes sense. Is there any drawback in loosing your updates, or slow to reflect changes because of the caching?</p><p>Thanks again Ray, really enjoyed this and have definitely learned a bunch, i look forward to the next competition.</p><p>J.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>re: cookie size - well, the thing is - I'd just worry about using it period - even if you try to keep it small. Again, I liked that you used it - it made it easy for me - but I'd worry about relying on it.</p><p>re: cached cfcs - I normally build a URL "hook" into my applications. By that I mean, I have code where if url.init is defined, I recreate my application scope CFCs.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm curious as to how you came up with the name "Rae" for your monster...my name is Rachel but all my friends call me Rae :) and I've heard of very few others who use that spelling. I guess it makes sense, being the feminine spelling of your name? Heh, just thought it was kind of funny!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep, that's it. ;) Although normally when I play an RPG and pick a girl, I use Romana. That was my name in the days when I played MUD too.</p></div>
