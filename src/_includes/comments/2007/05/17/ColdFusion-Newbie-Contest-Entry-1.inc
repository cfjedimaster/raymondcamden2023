		<div class="comment_text"><p>From a semantic xhtml standpoint there were a lot of tables and table attributes that could've been moved to css. To each their own, just saying :)</p><p>From a CF standpoint, the cfparams are not doing type checking and the main driving force of the app is via the url. There isn't really data validation like Ray said, and the two combined can potentially make it really easy for someone to replace cday with something other than a numeric and possibly expose errors down the line that would open up too much info to a malicious person etc.</p><p>I thought it was good though, and not offensive. Tongue in cheek joke on stereotyping :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, yes, in many cases you should be using css instead of tables.  However, CSS has such a learning curve that it's hard to write good css right off the bat until you've acquired experience.  And when you're kept busing coding and not learning css on the client's dime . . .</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK let me just say I love CSS my blog is CSS and if I had more time when writing this I would have used CSS. Tables where just a quick and easy way to put the layout together, with out having to worry about does it look good in each browser.</p><p>Now on to the image mapping I really don't use it but since I wanted the whole thing to have a South Park feel I used it for the first 2 pages again was me being lazy =)</p><p>I'm happy to see everyone talking about my design and not the code i guess it wasn't that bad =)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - Thanks for having this contest<br>John - Thanks for entering.</p><p>I've refreshed some knowlegdge by reviewing John's code and Ray's comments.</p><p>I would recommend using CFSwitch instead of the cfif...cfelseif construct whenever possible.  Here is a link to cfswitch in the CF Developer's Guide:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flivedocs.adobe.com%2Fcoldfusion%2F7%2Fhtmldocs%2F00000876.htm%3AVzp9a_3g7-MDpf4_BOWgO8XkW0U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000876.htm">http://livedocs.adobe.com/c...</a></p><p>Additionally, I recommend using integer constants instead of hard coded integer values.  integer constants can make your logic easier to follow when you have to maintain the app months later.</p><p>For example you have:</p><p>&lt;cfif obj IS "beer" OR obj IS "knife" OR obj IS "smoke" OR obj IS "shop1"&gt;<br>  &lt;cfset doMode1 = 2&gt; &lt;!---my note hard code int value---&gt;<br>  &lt;cfset doMode2 = 1&gt;</p><p>and the later in the code you have...</p><p>&lt;cfif doMode1 EQ 1&gt; &lt;!---my note hard code int value---&gt;<br>    &lt;cfset session.startSadness = session.startSadness - level1 /&gt;<br>&lt;cfelseif doMode1 EQ 2&gt;<br>    &lt;cfset session.startSadness = session.startSadness + level1 /&gt;<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;</p><p>instead you could use integer constants</p><p>&lt;cfif obj IS "beer" OR obj IS "knife" OR obj IS "smoke" OR obj IS "shop1"&gt;<br>  &lt;cfset doMode1 = INCREASE_SADNESS&gt;<br>  &lt;cfset doMode2 = DECREASE_HAPPINESS&gt;</p><p>later in the code...</p><p>&lt;cfif doMode1 EQ REDUCE_SADNESS&gt;<br>    &lt;cfset session.startSadness = session.startSadness - level1 /&gt;<br>&lt;cfelseif doMode1 EQ INCREASE_SADNESS&gt;<br>    &lt;cfset session.startSadness = session.startSadness + level1 /&gt;<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;</p><p>At the beginning of the CFM page you can set the values of these integer constants.</p><p>Again, thanks to everyone participating in this contest and to Ray for posting the entries.  I'm looking forward to reading others and learning/relearning good programming practices.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John - Loved your entry!<br>And I know exactly what you are saying about the "rush" and using tables for a quick fix. I did exactly the same thing - without any browser testing. Heck, I even threw in some empty paragraph tags to get spacing "fixed." *gasp*</p><p>Hopefully everyone will choose to ignore that horrible part of mine and focus on my other bad parts. Holding my breath until my crit.</p><p>Cheers - Nick</p></div>
