		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've gotta say that in IRC yesterday Adr0ck had a great discussion with a couple of us over sharepoint and how with further integration it could really have a negative impact on asp/CF/php and the like. He briefly mentioned the CF .net integration as a start to combatting that level of integration that technologies like SharePoint offer.</p><p>Anyhow proof is in the pudding. Put CF on your <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmonster.com%3AP83GRiLxctUkqza0w3HLYPBXaQk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="monster.com">monster.com</a> resume and watch the calls roll in.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>But, isn't the point here that ColdFusion represents a tiny percentage of the broader web application development universe?  Is there any doubt that Rails, PHP, ASP.NET, etc. vastly over-shadow ColdFusion in terms of overall market share (even individually)?  Being a niche language doesn't make it a bad language, nor does it mean there aren't lots of good jobs for talented ColdFusion developers, but just because there are thousands of CF developers doesn't mean it's not a niche language when you look at the big picture.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Other than 9 obvious mistakes, Ms. Brandel hasn't got a clue, especially when it comes to ColdFusion. She is exactly 180 degrees from the truth. It is also very clear, from the entire article, she did exactly no research. I can't believe IDG published this dribble. This reminds me of a story. It was 1996 at ISPCon. Bob Metcalf was a guest and had requested access to our local Ethernet before the show. Of course we were happy to give him anything he wanted, so we hunted down the techs that were bringing in the line. Bob told the tech what he wanted and the poor, dumb dweeb went of on a rant, to explain to Bob Metcalf exactly how Ethernet work and that what Bob wanted would never work. Well, this writer must be his sister. Please Bob, come back and put ComputerWorld on the right track.</p><p>At this piont, all I can think of is Dan and Jane on SNL...

I have been programming for nearly 20 years ( and I have a plethera of languages under my belt ).  My resume is posted on Monster (as someone else mentioned) and I get on average 5 to 10 hits a day looking for CF or Flex Programmers (moreso the CF).  Pretty good for a "dying" language I would say.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok,</p><p>While it's not dead, I think it is on a decline at the moment. Unless Adobe spend some marketing money or make it free or inexpensive, then this trend will continue.</p><p>ASP.NET has both serious marketing dollars and is free, PHP is Free, JSP is Free, Perl is Free.</p><p>Honestly, I haven't seen Adobe do much with ColdFusion, back in the good old days I used to get ColdFusion marketing guff hit my desk monthly, funnily enough one day I tried it and liked it.</p><p>I am a big user of forums, Experts Exchange for example, a lot of top posters in there in CF land are disapearing, when I check there profiles, they have moved to Java or .NET generally.</p><p>Hey, before you have a go at me, it's just how I see it. Have used .NET and JSP a lot and ColdFusion is much easier and more powerful. So my take on this is price, also if your going to write a cool Open Source project, you won't use ColdFusion as you can't distribute it to anyone without cost.</p><p>I've said this before, but the other thing that really hurts it is the fact that you can't write non Tag based code. Every Java or .NET developer i've ever shown it, just goes Yuck!</p><p>Every other language has a similar syntax, but ColdFusion for some reason is special persisting with it's tag based aproach. If they were smart they would have done both years ago and made CFSCRIPT complete.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dale - not to beat a dead horse here - but one of the reasons I USE CF and train other programmers in CF is that it can do BOTH (View and Code) and be used for BOTH purposes (as can PHP and ASP). However, because it IS Tag-based - it's easier to cross-train the web programming, straight HTML folks, in it's use AND still provide my OO programmers the power to write the "code" on the backend.</p><p>Just my opinion.</p><p>Can I write PHP and ASP? Yes.  Can I field an entire App in half the time using CF? Yes.  Can I integrate my code with other pages? Yes.  With technologies such as JSON, XML, WebServices, SOAP, etc - the "language barrier" gets slimmer and slimmer.  I have CF code that feeds ASP/JSP pages. I have ASP/JSP pages that feed CF Applications.  This is all much hoopla over nothing (again - in my opinion).</p><p>If you are looking for a free and opensource CF Alternative - allow me to direct you to:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithproject.org%2F%3AakZmiAawoFYdVeZGHKi4EiKHexM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.smithproject.org/">http://www.smithproject.org/</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with Mike E and Dale on the point that CF just will not be able to draw in the market share like ROR, PHP or ASP because of the price. I love CF and have been using it for over 10 years now but, as I posted over on Sean Corfields blog last week, until there is a free version of ColdFusion produced by Adobe it will continue to stay niche and deal with the criticism of folks like the idiots that published that article.</p><p>Think of how many more programmers there would be writing opensource apps in CF if it were free!</p><p>Im wondering how this is going to affect the integration with things like Flex and Apollo as well. If the Flex data services will support ROR, PHP and ASP, then CF is the only one thats not free in that list. So if Im a company looking at getting into the RIA world, do you think CF would be my first choice?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that considering CF's price as a limiting factor is a little naive. There are many costs to consider in developing and deploying an application, rather than CF's cost alone. For example, OS, hardware, webserver software, CF software, time/cost developing app, time/cost debugging, time/cost maintaining app, training developers, etc. An intelligent manager should be able to produce a matrix totaling the cost to deploy an application in each language. The reduced time for developing, debugging, and maintenance of CF apps is a huge cost saver that can easily topple other languages total costs despite them being cheaper or free for the server software. Also, there are other ways to offset the cost, such as coupling CF with Linux, rather than using M$ server. Each solution has its cost advantage/disadvantages that should be weighed to come up with a competitive solution. Further, Joel Spolsky's article made a good point that all these programming languages are powerful enough to accomplish what you want to do, but is more of a function of your hired programmer's abilities.</p><p>Now, about the article. This is what pisses me off about journalists sometimes. Just another example of cheap lazy journalism passing off popularity polling as a news story, with a cover yer ass statement so as to deflect any criticism about the journalists function to do RESEARCH and to report FACTS. Just drops the story, then runs away and watches in glee at the chaos that ensues, never to return and correct wrongs, or be held accountable for damage (to Adobe) these falsehoods cause.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray</p><p>I think you missed my point completely. Im not saying that price is that much of a concern for companies. I think that the corporate world is fine with paying for an application server. Especially since there are LOTS of companies that actually pay for Opensource technology just so they can have support. Thats the whole mentality of it.</p><p>My point is that not having a free version for either non-commercial use or free with no support options, or whatever is hindering the developer community and the opensource growth that Coldfusion really needs. Im SO pleased right now that the involvement in opensource CF is better than it has ever been, just look at the number of projects on your RIAForge and on Brian Rinaldis opensource list! But why is it taking SO long to get to this point? My belief is that its the price.</p><p>By having something like CFStandard as a free version even it was ONLY for non-commercial use would in my opinion be the shot in the arm that CF needs to continue to grow into what we all know it should and could be.</p><p>Am I crazy or do I remember correctly, wasnt there a free version of the CF server available at one point for a short time when Macromedia took over? Like a scaled down version or something?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with a lot of that Russ.</p><p>What would give CF a real boost would be a flexible license that hosting companies could make use of to allow non-commercial users to play with CF... i.e. for personal domains... I am using PHP on my own site at the moment, but if I was able to use CF i would use it, this would encourage more people to experiment with it... and grow to like it!</p><p>Which in-turn could mean more people will be encouraged to use it in their business environments too once they've been introduced to it and see how easy it is to work with.</p><p>The hosting company I am with at the moment is very cheap, but if i wanted CF would need a dedicated box with them. I know there are CF hosting out there but it's kinda pricey still... Cheapest one i seen is about £20 p/m while my current hosting costs about £25 for the whole year. (OK i *could* use my company's servers but that'd be cheating :P).</p><p>I believe even the more recent versions of Plesk include CF  support... so there's a good opportunity there if server admins don't need to do much work to get it running on a box too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So you spent 500 for Flex Builder because you saw that it helped you develop Flex apps quicker. But 1300 for CF is wrong somehow? Both are tools to help you deliver a product. Why do you say 500 is ok but 1300 is not? Ok, it is 800 mre, but the idea is the same I think. You are willing to pay money for a tool that helps you get stuff done.</p></div>

And as I and others have said, you can find cheap hosting for CF. Perhaps not as much as PHP, but if cheap is what you want, then you can find it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Hilary Bridel - switch to the federal government Hilary! They're putting new CF systems in place all over. Most recent notable system is the Do Not Call register ( <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.donotcall.gov.au%3ASM4JRHFsdntSuTJPrmrmBygD_Ys&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.donotcall.gov.au">http://www.donotcall.gov.au</a> ). Ausindustry and others are using CF as well.</p><p>I work in the NT and our local government is slowly seeing the light - though we have an uphill battle getting them to update their CF servers, more and more departments are getting involved. I just rolled out a system for Police, fire and emergency services. The Chief Minister's own newsroom system is CF(bugs being ironed out as we speak (related to server version!)). And everything within our primary industries and fisheries department seems to be almost 100% CF (Hi Mark, if you read this :) ).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dale and Brian both brought up points that were echoed several times in the comments to that ComputerWorld article.</p><p>I just wanted to respond to some points that Brian the tech manager brought up.</p><p>CF is an enterprise J2EE Web Application server.</p><p>If you were to be PHP or .Net shop, you should price out what 3rd party tools you would have needed to do the various things CF can do out of the box.  Such as PDF generation on the fly.  Built-in Report Builder.  Chart builder.  Built-in Flex engine for simple flex forms.  But to do all the things CF can do out of the box, you will end spending more than $1200 or $3000 to do the same or similar things with .Net or PHP.  In addition to this, one must add the price of being a Java Application Server and all the things that involves.  The price of Websphere is well over $10,000 I believe.</p><p>I think Ben Forta had an article or Blog post where he compared CF to a number of competing technologies and spelled out all the things CF Server comes bundled with.  In terms of cost out of the box, plus the cost to develop in it, it ends up costing much less to invest in CF.</p><p>Brian, I hope my comment does not come across as harsh.  I don't mean it to.</p><p>As an IT manager myself.  I'm just suggesting that if you are someone who has invested in CF, and your company has also.  Then you owe it to yourself to do the research, to validate your decision, so that you feel confident in defending it yourself first, then to others.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>People seem to get confused as to what a FREE version is.</p><p>A free version would be</p><p>Free to Download<br>Free to Develop In<br>Free to Use Commercially</p><p>If any of the above isn't true, then it's not free.</p><p>I did state that it should be limited, but a free version with decent functionality would open CF up to a whole new market.</p><p>Have a think about new developers looking to use some technology, was speaking to someone recently who asked what he should be learning. I answered by saying it depends what you want out of a language.</p><p>He said, I want to write some code and play around at making my own website. I said well .NET and Java are good and powerfull, but complex. PHP is less complex that .NET and popular. CF is the easiest to code and feature rich.</p><p>To which he replied, yeah but PHP is free.</p><p>Can you imagine a feature / price comparison matrix comparing JSP, .NET, PHP and CF if there was a free version. Also compare code to achive similar common tasks.</p><p>Coldfusion would win hands down. Still it's not going to happen if people can't get past the "It's not free mentality".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's finally starting...after running Coldfusion for 5 years with no resistance, I'm finally beginning to hear the old "Coldfusion is outdated", "Coldfusion is dead", "Coldfusion is going away" comments. Basically, there's an opinion circulating that Coldfusion is not a viable language and that we need to dump it asap. This doesn't seem to be based on anything valid, but the damage has already been done. Yet, it's hard to convince anyone otherwise when they've never heard of anyone else using it or seen anything written about it. I know this is the same old, same old but I hope Adobe can address this somehow soon so I am not stuck writing .NET crap for the next 10 years.</p></div>
