		<div class="comment_text"><p>So, it still doesn't work in FF :(. Well, I started learning Ajax and Spry only a few weeks ago...<br>Ray, the name was not given to the Application and not to the Pet. :) The cfc has a property "name" which is passed in the init() method. It is hardcoded now but I added it to give unique names to each pet. Nevertheless I should give some name to my App too.. :)<br>The login page was created to allow multiple users get their own pets. But unfortunately I didn't have a time to implement it.:(<br>Anyway it was real fun to participate in this contest and I'm looking forward to the next one.. ;)<br>Thanks!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>why cant you get any of these to run on your server? or at least have the developers have a working copy on their server somewhere??? seems a bit odd... and in my estimation should wholly invalidate an entry :)<br>hahaha, jk, but seriously... wtf.?????</p></div>

It's really useful.<br>@Tony Weeg<br>Unfortunately I don't have my homepage at this moment. But if you have CF on your PC you can copy the folder to your webroot.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've enjoyed this entry the most (so far) as it seems to provide a "fresh" perspective.  While Alexei may be a beginner CF programmer, He seems to have a good grasp of OOP.  Nice work sir.  Your AJAX example is particularly easy to understand.</p><p>One (newbie) question:</p><p>1. In the Tamagochi.cfc, I can't figure out why this code isn't listed in the init method.</p><p>&lt;cfset variables.instance = StructNew()&gt;<br>&lt;cfset <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariables.instance.name%3AQ3RtghjuqqgTmxCN-0qQV8CcOw4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="variables.instance.name">variables.instance.name</a> = ""&gt;<br>&lt;cfset variables.birthDay = ""&gt;<br>...</p><p>What is the purpose of listing it outside of a cffunction?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's an interesting question, Brad.<br>Frankly speaking I didn't even think about it. :)<br>I did it mostly because of my way of thinking about 'properties' and 'methods' I suppose. So the properties should be first 'declared' and only then 'defined' in the constructor. Perhaps this is the influence of my former experience in C++. :)<br>As for me I don't think it will somehow affect the functionality of the app if you include the properties in the init() method.</p></div>
