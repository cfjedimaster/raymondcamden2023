		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah.. I was SO looking forward to the show tonight after last week. And then.. nothing... just a big lead on until the finale.</p><p>I remember the underwater station from earlier episodes. When Jack was first captured and held, it was in that underwater place. Not sure if its the same one or not but seems like it would be.</p><p>Definitely cant wait until the 2 hour finale!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>one more - the girl from the helicopter crash, since Charlie was captured by all woman (it appeared), could she be an other plant from there.  They never saw the helicopter, just heard it and we have never seen the girl that captured Charlie before.</p><p>That might explain how Ben is going to be at the tower waiting on them.  She is spying on them for him.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like Charlie and  thought it was pretty good - but next week should be better :)</p><p>If they just wanted to kill the signal - why not just chop the cable?</p><p>And I too thought it was interesting the two people that came out to 'greet' Charlie were both women.  With the sub gone were these folks abandoned or what?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim, the cable wasn't power or for the signal - they called it an anchor. But cutting it could have helped too. But maybe not fast enough.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jack was in the Hydra with Juliette, who mentioned that she had no idea where the Hourglass Hatch was.</p><p>1-Does anyone think that Desmond's vision included the underwater hangout for the Swedish bikini team, which is why he volunteered to go in Charlie's place?</p><p>2-Something stinks with Jack and Juliette conveniently leading all the women to one location. Makes it easier to gather them "ALL" up.</p><p>3-Where was Sawyer the whole episode?</p><p>4-Pretty sure the cable to the Hourglass, was their cable TV. If their cable was cut, maybe the cable company would have come out to fix it, and rescued the survivors :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, Im not sure about the helicopter chick. Seems unlikely though since she had that pic of Desmond but anything is possible.</p><p>I agree with Ray on point 2, I havent trusted Jack since he's been all googly-eyed over Juliette. I think that hooker is just playing him like a fiddle. She's up to something, whether or not Jack is in on it remains to be seen but she's dirty.</p><p>You know, I didnt even think about Sawyer being gone. Seems wierd they were looking for shooters and he wasnt there. Was there something that we missed last week about him?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>All good points, kudo's to the guy who linked the photo montage....because...and everyone I watched it with disagrees with me but...if you look at the last picture in the montage, the lady on the left (Brown hair). I swear she is the stewardess that talked to Jack in season 1, we met again in this season when Jack gets introduced to the others. Anyone else see that. If its not her, its someone we've met before.</p></div>
