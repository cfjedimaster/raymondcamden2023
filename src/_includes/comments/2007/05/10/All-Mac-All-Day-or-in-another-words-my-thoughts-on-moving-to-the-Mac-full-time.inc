		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with you on that, my MacPro at work has me extremely jealous and using my G4/533 at home is painful in comparison.  I've been contemplating a G4 accelerator, but nothing would compare to the 2x2ghz joy that is sitting beside me.</p><p>The lack of USB ports seems to be a constant issue with Macs going back for years, maybe they think the ports on the keyboard make up for it?</p><p>As for the PC keyboard, I used one on my Mac at home for a while but finally broke down and spent the $30, and it was definitely worth it, but that's just me.  Personally I hate any keyboard that doesn't have the home-end block correct, which is 90% of the keyboards on the market today.</p><p>BTW, you can remap the modifier keys so they work the way you want, just go to System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard and Mouse -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Modifier Keys.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, sounds like a sweet rig. I'm guessing that quad core CPU is what's making it scream, as well as the 4MB of L2 cache it came with. Comparing that to a single CPU PC with (probably) less than 1MB of L2 really is fair, but I understand your enthusiasm.</p><p>have you gotten MySQL running on it? i'd be interested to see some benchmarks on that, considering the quad core and all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Re: sound - I like the flexibility of the sound handling so that I can have certain programs using the headset and other programs using the built-in speakers. It even maintains different volume levels for each sound device (so I can mute my speakers but still use the headset for Skype).</p><p>Re: the CD drawer... there are systems that let you load the drive with a button press? I've always just pushed the CD drawer back into the machine - for all the years I've ever had CD drives on machines (and never broken a CD drive that way). Live and learn!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>I've had a few issues with mac now that I've gone fully mac based myself. A few of them were answered here in your comments, like "end line". I usually take the approach of apple + right arrow and it takes me to end of line, But back to your post:<br>"When I booted up - sound wanted to output from the box itself - not my speakers. I was able to fix that easily enough"</p><p>How did you fix that, I just recently bought my new mac mini 1.83Ghz Duo Core for my home desktop and does the same thing. kinda urked me too...</p><p>and also, another thing that kinda gets me is, I'm a huge fan of using tab to browse through form elements, and I've noticed (it could just be the implementation of FF on mac) but when I tab to a select box it skips it and goes to the next text box instead. Like I said it could be the implementation of FF on a mac, because another thing I just noticed this weekend is it doesn't read CSS2 that great. On one of my apps I used the @import statement to import a css file and Camino and FF on my mini didn't pick the css file up. I had to add a "link ref" tag for the browser to pick it up... :-(</p><p>ahh just some food for thought. Anyone else notice these FF on Mac issues??</p></div>
