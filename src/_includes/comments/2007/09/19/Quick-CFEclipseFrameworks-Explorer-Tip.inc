		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you mean RDS - yes, you can do RDS in Eclipse - but it isn't via the CFEclipse plugin - it is via the RDS plugins by Adobe.</p><p>Basically - as a developer you have two main plugins for Eclipse:</p><p>CFEclipse - this gives you color coding, framework support, etc.</p><p>RDS Plugins by Adobe - these give you RDS support, plus other things like the Log Viewer, Debugging, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use Oxygen for Eclipse (the stand-alone IDE, is better than the Eclipse Plug-in) because the formatting options are incredible for XML, including the sorting of attribute names and indentation that respects the hierarchy of XML. It makes XML much more readable as a project grows.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I must admit I did start using Eclipse, although in the form of Aptana as it seemed to be easier to move to from Dreamweaver. I did like it - some of the features are lovely - but I ended up returning to Dreamweaver due to the CFEclipse plugin. It just seems so slow for code completion. In Dreamweaver, code completion is bliteringly fast, with all the CF attributes for a chosen tag popping up without delay. I found in CFEclipse that I'd be pressing return to accept the option before it was showing up and thus causing a line break - very, very annoying.</p><p>Does anyone else have this problem or is it just CFEclipse running in Aptana? I also found CFEclipse to be very slow when editing large files.</p><p>I'd love to return to Aptana / Eclipse at some point if the code completion was as fast as Dreamweaver. I must admit, I do have a soft spot for DW though having used it since version 1.</p><p>The main reason for jumping ship before was my journey into CFC's which CFEclipse does handle very nicely (DW has a compent browser but it's far from what CFEclipse offers).</p></div>
