		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having done quite a bit of work with .Net and CF, I am incredibly disappointed in the ColdFusion and .Net 2 video mentioned by BradT.</p><p>There is an obvious bias against CF in every word of the presentation and its a salesman's presentation, not a developer's. Having plenty of experience in .Net I question anyone who calls it a full-featured, object-oriented application framework, let alone event driven. Granted, those terms are used very loosely these days. He also writes off CFCs completely, which makes it obvious his target audience is highly impressionable people trying to learn about technologies rather than providing information to CF developers of much experience at all.</p><p>This really concerns me because Adam Churvis (the author) has what appears to be a solid background in web development with CF, but every time he writes on blogs or mailing lists, seems to ignore that experience other than using it for credit to borrow against. Then again, I've seen developers claim 20 years of experience that really mean 1 year of experience that they repeated for 20 years, though I wouldn't judge Adam that way. I think he has simply picked a side and isn't looking to be a source of good advice, but a missionary for a belief.</p><p>Despite that, I highly recommend checking out .Net as well as Ruby on Rails though to learn how to make your CF apps better as well as deciding whether you are using the ideal technology for your projects. I have changed the way I develop code often times from looking at the way code is written in other languages. The best tool, is usually the one that learns from all other tools.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunately I can't watch the video. I do have the WMV plugins for Mac, but the video hasn't worked on two Mac's I've tried.</p><p>I don't think one should be surprised that this is slanted towards one technology - nor should one be surprised if it is marketing oriented veruss developer oriented - it's just the audience picked for the preso.</p><p>I -would- have a problem though if something is said obviously _wrong_ about CF. Again though, I can't watch the video. :(</p><p>I've met Adam, and knew him to be a darn good guy. I know he has pretty much left the CF world. I would _assume_ he would be a fair minded guy normally.</p><p>Mike - a huge, huge, +1 on recommending folks look at other technologies. I love to read articles on Ruby, Net, etc, especially "How do I do X", because it is interesting to compare and contract.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sadly, he's totally right about the level of support in OSS.  I'm implementing a certain CMS for a friend/client of mine which will have an e-commerce component.  There's a very popular plugin (at least, this one has the most userbase of all the available e-commerce plugins for the CMS).  Looking at the support board for this plugin, it's very, very illustrative as to how MIA the the plugin authors are in the support board.  The "read" number for the threads grows everytime I visit this board, and yet answers are very few and far (it can take almost a month for 1st answer come up, and even then the user's question may not be answered till months later).</p><p>There's a niche for OSS, but be prepared to spend your own time debugging other people's code.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The CF Community is a huge plus for the language.  Apart from it being my favorite web language, b/c I've worked with many others PHP, .NET, classic ASP, and Java.. the tight knit and family like feel of the CF community means a lot to me, and I really appreciate that as a developer.</p><p>PHP: Great code execution, slower dev time, community sucks (too many foreign language resources; too many junk developers).</p><p>.NET: Good code execution time, slower dev time, community decent.</p><p>CF: Good code execution time, great dev time, awesome community</p><p>And I think CF is the number 1 web dev language in the UK. lol. Maybe someone from the UK can confirm that for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>BL: I'm going to get nit picky on one point. You said PHP had too many foreign language resources. That isn't a bad thing. There may not be enough _English_ resources- but there certainly isn't anything wrong with foreign language resources.</p></div>
