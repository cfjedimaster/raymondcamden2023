Some of the strange padding / page break issues can cause you to loose sleep.  I switched to Java's iText and I haven't looked back.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bundled Verity search engine has caused me several gray hairs in the past, at least for following issues</p><p>- indexing doesn't neccessarily support latest version of documents and used to break if something unsupported was provided. I had most issues with relatively recent PDF files and ended up writing code to determine PDF version and skip unsupported ones.</p><p>- there is limit how many hits it will return, I hit that around 8000 documents but it seems to depend on data itself.<br>This should be expected but it's not properly documented as far as I know.</p><p>- indexing large amount of documents needs to be done in batches. I ended up doing 1.000 for each run. This requires some custom code.</p><p>- I don't think I ever got it to work with non-english documents but in all honesty I haven't tried that since 2000.</p><p>Verity is nice to have but if you need something that would be called "enterprise level" look for some other solutions.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The other thing that comes to mind for me (and again, I don't know how much this may have been improved on CF8) is use of QoQ with larger recordsets. It's such a powerful tool it can be easy to overuse it, and it simply can't handle some of the heavy lifting the actual database engine can.

The "not using the database" is the one I often see with inexperienced developers. I still remember the time I found code in a legacy application that did a "SELECT * FROM Table" and then did a cfloop over it to find a specific record....rather than just using a WHERE clause in the query.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll just add two things that aren't so much "don't do them in CF" as they are "don't do them in languages not designed for them, and CF isn't designed for them"</p><p>1)  Crunching lots of large numbers.  I've tried to do this in CF and, while it eventually gets there, it's slow.  If you know something like C or Haskell, offload the task into an external, preferably compiled, function.  Obviously better in MX6/7/8 that it was in 5, and your value of "lots" and "large" may vary.</p><p>2)  The same thing, except with text processing.  CF can handle quite a bit, but when I need to analyze multimegabyte text files, it is not my language of choice.  Perl or Python both do the job (typically) better and faster (IMHO).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll go back to Gus' comment about using the built-in form validation and go ahead and give the reasoning as to why it should be avoided, although I want to expand on the comment slightly and say that you shouldn't use the automatic *server-side* validation. If you plan to write your own server-side validation but also want some client-side stuff, the cfform JavaScript is acceptable (but I personally prefer using Dreamweaver CS3's Spry form validation stuff as it provides for a nicer end-user experience.)</p><p>First, CF still uses single quotes in the generated hidden fields, meaning that the error message cannot contain apostrophes (so you can't say, "You must provide the customer's last name"). Related to that is the fact that the generated hidden fields aren't closed and thus result in invalid XHTML. Neither of these issues have ever been considered as a high enough priority to get fixed, but they severely limit the usefulness of the validation.</p><p>Second and much more importantly, the fact that the server-side validation relies on the presence of hidden fields at all is a huge problem and should be a deal-breaker to anyone who is serious about form validation. It is ridiculously easy to get the form to submit without those hidden fields, at which point you have no validation at all. The simplest method is to download and install the Tamper Data extension for Firefox (or something similar). The only slightly more difficult method is to simply create your own HTML file that submits to the same action page, and simply excludes the hidden fields.</p><p>The first most important rule in form validation is that you should never trust any data coming from the browser, and yet the cfform validation relies on exactly that and should thus make anyone's list of things you shouldn't do in CF.</p><p>I would also like to add a caveat to your statement about not using deprecated features. I think it's as important to be aware of, and make sure you use, any new features in CF that will make your life easier. (Which is the whole point of using CF, right?) Take logging in users - I still seee applications that are being written today that manually handle logging users in and tracking them on the site, rather than using the cflogin framework. The same would apply, on a much bigger scale, to all of the many developers who continue to shy away from CFCs imply because they don't want to take the time to learn them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As we deal with spatial data (i.e. maps of Antarctica and its surrounds), we often like to produce light-weight maps of results along with a coastline or bathymetry. This means using external products like Geoserver or ITT's IDL to render data in various projections which CF knows nothing about. The problem is each mapping tool requires its own data access and query scripts that have to be kept in logical sync with anything we do in CF.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,</p><p>In my opinion a developer should always be concerned about the speed of what he is developing. He/she should always be thinking about how to do things better/faster.  Create a stored procedure to aggregate data on the database instead of doing it in CF for example.</p><p>So to answer your question yes we should be worried about a cfswitch vs cfif/elseif and here is why.</p><p>A cfswitch will find the matching cfcase and jump to and execute that case, while a cfif/elseif will evaluate until it finds a matching one or drop out to the last cfelse.</p><p>Not only is a cfswitch faster its also easier to read and maintain.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you may have misunderstood me. Obviously speed is important. But do you not write code using cfswitch because cfif is faster, even though cfswitch may be more readable? (Or vice versa.)</p><p>My point is - you can and should worry about speed at a level where you have control over it. But when it comes down to timing and comparing individual CF functions/tags, I think it is a mistake, especially when from version to version it may change. Many tags/funcs were sped up in CF8.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Try/Catch is intended to wrap code that may throw an exception and that you have no control over. It is not meant to hide all exceptions over an entire page. So for example - imagine i have a datasource that points to a DB that - for whatever reasons - is sometimes offline. I have no control over that - so using try/catch around the query makes sense.</p><p>Now imagine I want to output X. X may not exist. Should I try/catch that? No - I can use isDefined instead.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Doug S. - I think he was meaning both the potential overhead of weapping an entire page in a block as well as the possiblilty of opening up vulnerabilities by having the entire page in a catch.</p><p>@Rob - I've been told a lot by people to never use cfform or the built in form validation for a variety of reasons. I've often found them to be somewhat outdated, but not completely invalid. I never knew the things you pointed out on the single quotes, thanks!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>1: Don't have CF do what your database should be doing.  Do your best to limit database calls. Write stored procedures to combine multiple calls or to do data manipulation logic.  Databases are designed to process data so let them do it.</p><p>2: Logically break up your code.  Don't put all 500 files for your site in a single directory.  This just makes it harder to develop and maintain.  Use sub directories and split the code up.</p><p>3: Don't do something just cause you can.  By this I mean, don't write some overly complex code or have this one off procedure in a part of a site just because CF could do it.  Every site does not need to be a showcase for all the glory that is CF.  Know when to say enough is enough.</p><p>--Dave</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy - I'm curious about your statement to avoid overusing isdefined, and instead using cfparam. Is there a significant performance difference there? I mean, is &lt;cfparam name="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>" default=""&gt; then &lt;cfif <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a> is ""&gt; really better than &lt;cfif not isdefined("<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>")&gt;?</p><p>Not trying to play devil's advocate or anything here, by the way - I'm genuinely curious.</p><p>Oh, and one more "shouldn't do" that I see a lot from beginners - having essentially static content get generated from a DB by CF, such as navigation bars. Yes, there are plenty of aps where the navigation really is changing constantly and needs to be dynamic, but I've seen lots of examples of nav that rarely if ever changes that is still generated by CF, instead of being plain old HTML. The same would apply to using date functions to output the copyright year - something that needs to be changed exactly once per year (and yeah, I have seen it done).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So much to address....</p><p>First, I agree with Sean about CFFORM validations...when using Ajax forms I'm starting to get back to using the built in validations a bit (hey, you're in a cfform anyways...and as he said they're not _that_ bad).</p><p>Second... I have no problem whatsoever with using year(now()) to output a copyright date in a footer (or anywhere)...  If your app needs the extra .000000001ms saved by hardcoding this - and your time is so cheap that you don't mind wasting 5 minutes every year changing this (oh - what if it's not in your hands anymore...) then by all means hardcode the date.  Sorry for being brutally honest...</p><p>Thirdly...  Just my opinion here, but I can't remember the last time I used isDefined.  It's just not in my toolbox anymore.  To me it's almost like var scoping in a cfc...if I'm creating a variable somewhere in my page I immediately hop to the top of the page and param it.  Also - boo on using &lt;cfif <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a> is "" /&gt;  -- use len() - and don't do &lt;cfif len(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>) is 0&gt; -- why take the extra step?  CF will evaluate to boolean so &lt;cfif len(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>)&gt; is all you need (same goes with recordCount, etc).</p><p>Thats all for now...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@todd, totally agree on your second point and the first half of your third point.</p><p>Totally disagree on using &lt;cfif not len(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>)&gt; rather than the much more explicit &lt;cfif <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a> is ""&gt; or &lt;cfif trim(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>) is ""&gt; - part of the issue here is that &lt;cfif len(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>)&gt; just doesn't read as language: "if the length of the form field foo..." If the length what? And of course it's not len() which is a negative condition instead of is "" which is a positive condition. This is basic readability. Compare with "if the trimmed value of the form field foo is the empty string" which is what &lt;cfif trim(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.foo%3A9FYsWPiTxPoThxsdGmWRNLcJr8I&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.foo">form.foo</a>)&gt; says.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree 100% on using the database where possible! Have learned the hard way myself ;-)</p><p>Off the top of my head I would add...</p><p>1. Using TABs to indent code and/or leaving unnecessary spaces within your files slows down the page rendering significantly. I suggest using minimal spaces and returns in your code and would put more emphasis on code performance than code-readability. I have seen significant performance gains by striping all unnecessary whitespace characters from CF files and although this is a generic issue not solely related to CF it has proved time and again to be a good place to start when optimising page-load performance.</p><p>2. Wrapping entire pages of HTML display code in CFOUTPUT when there are only a couple of variables to output in the middle of the code! Using CFOUTPUT just around the variable is my preferred method where possible.</p><p>3. Using CFOUTPUT around code which has nothing to output! hahahaha... I have seen this TOO many times from in-experienced developers.</p><p>4. Relying on the timeout setting in CFADMIN to stop long requests from processing. This can lead to dropped connections and page timeouts on busy servers/apps. My preferred approach is to have the tieout really low in my development environment and use debugging to highlight code which requires longer to process. I then use the CFSETTING tag on these particular templates to specify a longer timeout value. On live servers I have the CFADMIN timeout set to 45 secs.</p><p>5. Not scoping variables... for the love of God scope your variables... always!</p><p>6. Using stupid un-descriptive names for database tables, database fields, variables, etc. If you have a table for employees call it "employees" not "EMP"... if it has a field for FirstName call it FirstName not "FN"... unless of course you really want to frustrate the hell out of the poor sod who is trying to understand your app!</p><p>PS. love your stuff Ray!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I disagree with stripping out the white space. I think whatever you gain in page download will be dwarfed by what you lose in code productivity.</p><p>I'm also a bit lose on my cfoutput. I won't do an entire page, but to me, this is more readable:</p><p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;<br>some text, a #var#, some more text<br>&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p><p>Then this:</p><p>some text, a &lt;cfoutput&gt;#var#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;, some more text</p><p>The first option lets me see the text clearer. And anyway - CF just igores anything not in #s anyway.</p><p>As for table names - remember some DBs prevent you from using nice long names. I think it's Oracle that has some crazy rules for names. I always laugh - you pay a fortune for a DB that has insane rules for names. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In regards to whitespace, I should have said "excessive" TABs, whitespace and multiple concurrent carrige returns. For example I would replace 3x line breaks with a single line break, which still allows you to scan the code easily ;-) and always use spaces as opposed to TABS for code indentation.</p><p>I disagree on the performance aspect as I have honestly seen significant improvements, especially when replacing TAB-indented code blocks with spaces.</p><p>I agree with your comment regarding CFOUTPUT and adopt the same methodology myself.</p><p>It's interesting to weigh the performance benefits against the development productivity benefits. I'd like to hear others feelings about which should take precedence. Personally I put the emphasis on performance because a poorly performing application is destined to be unused, unwanted and ultimately dumped, therefore negating the requirement for further development at all ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>#1 annoyance with code I've worked with:  bad/inconsistent abbreviations...</p><p>I used to abbreviate alot - then realized how stinking confusing it gets to be.</p><p>Hypothetical example: columns mgrName and areaMngrName in the same table.</p><p>So now you're in your CFC thinking "gee, how did I abbreviate that column again?" and you're jumping back to the DB to check.  Then you're calling your CFC on another page and outputting a query and you're thinking again "gee,  what was that column called again?".  This issue is compounded in this example because it used different abbreviations for the same word (mgr and mngr for manager).  So I look it up the first time and assume the second instance uses the same abbreviation and now I'm looking it up _again_.</p><p>All avoidable by simply not abbreviating.  (Disclaimer:  unless the abbreviation is commonly accepted and not easily confused - such as ID).  Just my opinion, but I rarely abbreviate anymore.  The time it costs me to type out 'managerName' is less then it takes me to go look it up...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Can any of you tell me (because I am so new to CF the wrapper the software came is is still in my hand) what limites there are on CFFORMs and Checkboxes???</p><p>Reason I ask is I have built a site with 40 pages and one is now nearly 3000 lines of code and it was working fine until I added a tooltip which was coded correctly but seemed to be the straw that broke the camels back and now the page will load but the form which houses all the fields and main part of the page is blank.  Of course I undid the last tooltip and re-put but the same is happening.</p><p>I 100% haven't got duplicate names or src that doesn't exist or such like...it was working fine, i put an extra tool tip and now its broken.</p><p>I also had a similar issue with check boxes on a tab navigator in that it seems the limit is 20 check boxes...add a 21st and the page says nope, not loading anymore....</p><p>I really tried to google this for some time before posting this here...</p><p>ALL help understanding limits in CF8 would be greatly received</p></div>
