		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yup, finally managed to pick one up Sunday - the Wii definitely rules!  As much as you read about it, that's still nothing till you actually try it.  I had 3 friends over and we were switching between the NFL playoffs and frames of Wii bowling.  I had given up on xbox 3 or 4 years ago since it was such a time sink, but the Wii is just way too fun!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been wanting to try it out but haven't had a chance to yet.  It looks like it would be a lot of fun to play.  I'll probably pick one up sometime this year.  I have a xbox which just sits there most of the time. I find it hard to get interested in games nowadays.  5 minutes and then I'm bored.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got a Wii for Christmas. What a blast!  I highly recommend Rayman's Raving Rabbits.  It's a bunch of mini-games, but it's funny as all get out.  I also have Madden 2007 which is pretty cool to play.  My only problem is I can't find a second nunchuck controller so I can play with a buddy.  But I find that I spend more time playing Wii Sports than anything else.  I'm approaching pro level on both Tennis and Boxing and they are starting to become a workout!</p></div>

Now, I'm waiting on MS to send me a box to ship it back to them so they can fix it for me.  Hopefully it won't take a month to get it back.  I need my Xbox!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I want one...uh...for my kid. Seeing as I have a 360 this will be my excuse. Actually the funny thing about it is that my wife really wants one and she isn't a gamer to say the least. I am hoping the backwards compatibility lives up to its promise unlike some systems (ahem...sony) since we have quite a few GameCube games.</p><p>By the way, I thought this was going to be a negative review since the title called it a "revoltion" - I was thinking it was a clever play on words. After reading I assume that is not what you meant.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had my Wii since launch (I actually waited for a few hours in Wal-Mart for the midnight release) and I'm definitely not regretting it!  Wii Sports is a blast (alone or with a crowd), Zelda is excellent (I've actually begun to wonder how I've ever aimed the bow and arrow and such without the pointer), Rayman is very good (as long as you don't object to cartoon violence), as is Monkeyball (perfect for the motion-sensing single-player game, plus a lot of interesting mini-games for multi-player action), and Madden is a big (and pleasant) shift from the norm.</p><p>Add in all the virtual console games, and you've got quite a collection.  There I've already gathered up quite a few, including a few of the Mario and Zelda games.  They're extremely well done!</p><p>When I get home tonight, I'll grab my friend code so we can all mingle as well!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can see it now...  30 years from now, this will be known as the "Wii Generation".  Seriously though... I have not been a big "console" game fan for a long time (as I am MUCH better with Keyboard and Mouse than I am with a game controller).  The Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii has changed my outlook on that.  The Wii-mote/nunchuk interface WORKS LIKE A CHAMP. (BTW, I am with ya on the sore shoulder from the Wii Sports bowling, Ray.) I've nothing but good things to say about it.  Except maybe... THEY NEED TO PRODUCE MORE OF THEM...  Huntsville, AL gets about 15 Wii's (total) in at a time. for the whole CITY!  Yeesh...  MUCH more demand than supply.  My sone has 5 games, two "motes", two "chuks" and still can't get him the CONSOLE!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stop it! You're all killing me here.  I really wanted to get a Wii for my family for Christmas, but couldn't convince my wife that we NEEDED one, so we ended up with a gamecube instead.  The agony of defeat!!  I suppose I'll have to wait till November and start trying again for next Christmas.  What I'm really hoping is that by then the price will come down, and the hackers will come up with some good stuff so I can start streaming video from my pc via wifi.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Welcome to the Revolution!  After convincing my wife (Sorry Jeff!) to get one I have to admit It's a blast!!  I had given up on consoles as they have always been harder for me to play.  I have tons of games on the PC but squeezing my hands onto a little controller (compared to a keyboard and mouse) seemed to cause no end of problems.  After leaving my PS2 and XBox collecting dust for over a year (and finally giving them both away) I decided to try one last time and got the Wii.  BEST idea I've ever had!!</p></div>
