		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just wanted to thank you for your initial example of the calendar. It helped me build the calendar for: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zaperone.com%2Fknoll%2FCalendar%2Findex.cfm%3AEcq0NGBpH_xJ05hqigAeVLFA97o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.zaperone.com/knoll/Calendar/index.cfm">http://www.zaperone.com/kno...</a> A website that is currently in the testing phase, not the most beautiful masterpiece but i figured out how to integrate some CSS to make the design a bit nicer. Also note how you can navigate between months and it keeps track of it in the url. So theoretically it goes forever. This calendar also loads events from a database added by teachers, or school groups.</p><p>SO THANKS SO MUCH, for giving me the start i needed. Tell me what you think if you can. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>First off, thanks for the work you do and the information you share!  I am a beginner with ColdFusion and articles like this are priceless.</p><p>I had a question about passing events to the calendar, and the question is; how do I do it? My work with ColdFusion has mainly been with databases. I don't understand where the attributes, such as *attribute.event*, are coming from, and I don't understand queering a query. I would think if you were not using a database for a query then you would use a form to populate the event information, but then you would have *<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fform.events%3Ag9ESujkRE6AoBA_S04gCzXS8dTQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="form.events">form.events</a>* rather than *attribute.event*, at least I think you would.</p><p>Hope that's clear</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well the idea was that you had events in your database already and you selected them in a query. That query, let's call it foo, would be passed to the custom tag in the events argument. This is covered in the previous entries.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I went through all three entries on the calendar again and I did manage to find out why you are using *attribute.event*. But I still do not see how to get my query information to pass to the custom tag. Please forgive me if I am being a dumb dumb but I just don't see what I am missing. This is the code I have:<br>&lt;body&gt;</p><p>&lt;cfquery name="events" datasource="employeeApplicants"&gt;<br>	SELECT title, date, link<br>    FROM Events<br>    &lt;/cfquery&gt;</p><p>&lt;cfoutput query="events"&gt;<br> &lt;cf_calendar title="#title#" date="#date#" link="#link#"&gt;<br> &lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p><p>&lt;/body&gt;</p><p>I have six entries in the database and when I view my page I see six calenders with no events inserted in any of them.</p><p>Thanks again for your help with this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You only want to run cf_calendar one time, and you pass the events query to it. Did you download the attached file? It shows an example. Given that your query is called events, you would do this:</p><p>&lt;cf_calendar events="#events#" linkcolumn="link2"&gt;</p><p>Again - try the downloaded attachments from the blog posts.</p></div>
