		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice Ray that's 2 apps for you and .1 for me the only thing I have made with Apollo is a Hello World app. Nothing like you stuff but at least I'm on the band wagon from the begging this time. I'm on Chapter 5 of "Adobe Flex 2: Training from the Source" and just ordered the Action Script 3.0 Cookbook.</p><p>I'm glad your take the time to talk about Flex and Apollo, it's helping me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's not JS, its ActionScript 3. Both are based on ECMAScript, which is why it is so easy to learn one after you know the other.</p><p>Locks up eh? I bet I screwed something up in my loop.</p><p>I'm rewriting it RIGHT now to not use a textarea. Instead, I'm going to apply style sheets to the text matches.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>After i read the code closer i realized it was AS.  Guess it helps to actually read it.  :)</p><p>It does not lock up if i use super simple RE like.</p><p>regex<br>123</p><p>body<br>abc123</p><p>Cant wait to the the CSS stuff.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&lt;rant&gt;<br>Ugh. I know AS is so much like JavaScript (and I love JavaScript), but I always thought I could avoid having to learn AS since I stayed away from Flash. Now with Flex and Apollo, it seems inevitable that ActionScript will become yet another language web developers in the Adobe/ColdFusion realm will have to pick up.</p><p>What happened to the good old days when an app was written in one language? :-D<br>&lt;/rant&gt;</p></div>
