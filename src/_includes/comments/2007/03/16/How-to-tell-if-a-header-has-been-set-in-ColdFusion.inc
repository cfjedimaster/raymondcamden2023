		<div class="comment_text"><p>Okay man, got one for ya. I have been trying to set cache with CF11 cache tags and skipping the web.config file. I have determined from using various tools like Fiddler and a few sites for testing cache etc... that the etag can be created when the web.config file enables cache, max-age etc... The when I test using an online tool to determine if caching is working it does show cache-control works and the files being cached along with a prompt of etag is working.</p><p>When trying to fetch the ETag header this way: etags = getHttpRequestData().headers['ETag']; it does not work. Why if the ETag is being generated by the web.config file enabling cache is it that the ETag can not be obtain from the CF code above?</p><p>I know that when trying to create cache with cfcache tags it does work, scripting style or regular cache tags, but when I remove the cache options from the web.config file and then test it for caching, it does not show any files being cached or an ETag in the online tester. Any clues for me old man?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, I meant you. Hope you are doing well. Okay, not the response I expected but what the heck thought I would say hey. Thanks though. Are you still doing CF or just node.js?</p></div>
