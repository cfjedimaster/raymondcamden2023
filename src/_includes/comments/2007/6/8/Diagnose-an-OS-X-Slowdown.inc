		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would backup your system now.  I had a mac laptop that would freeze up sporatically and the hard drive eventually died.  Now the music still playing is curious maybe it is cached in memory.  Or not your HD at all.</p><p>HD's usually do die in the few few months if they are bad from the factory.</p><p>None the less, I would run the disk utilies applicaitons and repair the disk and disk permissions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I often experience slow downs on my iMac 24.  I even upped my memory from 2gb to 3gb (it seemed to help - for a while).  I agree with Chad and strongly suspect corruption of the permissions.  Why this happens is a mystery to me but once a week I correct the permissions (there are always some to be corrected) using Disk Utility.  This, also, seems to help.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oddly enough, I've never had permissions problem on my macs over the past few years, until yesterday.  Yesterday I received my free upgrade of Creative Suite 3 but it wouldn't install.  I deleted stuff, disabled stuff, etc, etc, nothing worked.  Then I tried repairing the permissions and it saw a *bunch* of stuff that was broken, and then CS3 installed!  The slow-down sounds odd though, try installing SmartReporter and see what it says.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@John - Yes, that is correct. You can even do a "kill -9 #processID#" to kill processes. The only problem is, unless you had terminal open before the slowdown, it's much easier to just use the appl-opt-esc (or something like that) to bring up the gui kill app.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Took a sec to figure out appl-opt-esc been along time since I've had a nice Mac. I was suggesting top so he could have it open and see the proccesses running, im sure Ray has a big screen and can spare a few inches. If top was open and the slow down started Ray could see what was doing it. I haven't used a Unix or Linux or any other terminal since back in my CCNP days.</p></div>

And if it happens again then I would refrain from using it until its out of beta.</p><p>I looked at mozy but I cant see the purpose of it.. And you are storing your data on their server and I wouldnt store my data on someone elses server.</p><p>What I do is as I go to bed I drag my entire home folder onto an external drive. The benefit of that is that if something happens I can just reinstall os and drop my home folder over my new one and its exactly how it was and it works. Lets see winblows do that..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, I have been experiencing very similar issues on my Macbook Pro. Since I have upgraded to the latest beta of Mozy, Im getting some SERIOUS memory and CPU usage issues with Mozy. I used to just let it run automatically every 30 minutes or so and you never could tell it was running.</p><p>Now the thing eats up like 80% - 90% CPU when its running so I have had to change it to only run at 3am.</p><p>I have a ticket in with the Mozy guys and they are VERY responsive so I hope to hear something soon.</p></div>
