		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought I had heard that is was "Macromedia eXperience". Of course, all of those came out at the time where "X" was in everything. I did notice it too, Ray, I just figured since all the other Macromedia projects went into "CS3" that the MX was on its way out anyways.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I noticed too, but expected that since it's ADOBE ColdFusion now, the MX would go away. I wouldn't be surprised if ColdFusion gets renamed entirely in the future; perhaps something with LiveCycle Enterprise Suite(ES). LOL</p><p>They renamed Flex Data Services, LiveCycle Data Services ES. Why? Because of the additional PDF capability? If that's the case, ColdFusion could be next. I mean LCDS Express is included with CF8, it even installs with it. CF8 also gets quite a bit of PDF capability in version 8, which comes from LiveCycle. The assimilation has already started. Resistance is futile.</p><p>Telltale signs of a name change or coincidence? Get ready for LiveCycle Markup Language(LCM) and LiveCycle Components(LCC). I wonder if they could make it work with legacy .cfm and .cfc files and the new .lcm and .lcc files at the same time?</p><p>Just brainstorming. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unless they dramatically tighten the development cycle I doubt they will ever use dates. MX7 would have be ColdFusion 2005, which unless you're on the ball only tends to emphasize the periods between major releases.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good, glad it is gone...I mean what value does it add from a marketing perspective if no one even knew what it meant? In my office we have also speculated on the LiveCycle related name, and I said it might end up LiveCycle Server Documents or LSD - then, we could have Tim (Buntel not Leary - who is of course dead) exhorting people to "Turn on, tune in..."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm glad they shortened it to Coldfusion 8, how elegant! :-) MX reminds me of Macromedia, which is a good thing in my mind, but probably a bad thing to the Adobe marketing staff.</p><p>I doubt that they'll ever change the "Coldfusion" name... unless their marketing research shows that perceived negative stigma from non-Coldfusion people overwhelms the difficulty of creating an entirely new brand name. (and making your existing users angry in the meantime. ;-) Breeze wasn't as strong of a brand and probably didn't have a fan base that was so tied to the name.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, I'm of the opinion that MX = MatriX.  After all, the java based CF runtime was codenamed Neo, not just because it was new, but because of the movie.  Anyone remember the techno and green laser light show?</p></div>
