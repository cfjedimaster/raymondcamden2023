		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't speak for anyone else, but here's my dilemma with Application.cfc vs. Application.cfm.</p><p>1.  As a newb, my biggest priority is getting something to work, and to have a decent grasp of why it works.  When starting with Coldfusion, I found a lot more information and, most importantly, more helpful examples that involved App.cfm than App.cfc.  As most newb applications (well, at least mine) will tend to be small and nearly all CRUD based, the additional "power" of App.cfc is not really that big of a deal (at least not conceptually for the newb).</p><p>2.  Then there is the issue of cfcs in general.  If my application is simple, and only requires the use of a function or two per page, the need or desirability of packaging this functionality in a cfc is not immediately apparent.  So if one is not already using cfcs extensively, the general ignorance about their operation and purpose will definitely be a detractor from utilizing an Application file that ends with the same extension...</p><p>Again, to the newb, getting something to work--period--will often take precedence over getting something to work as efficiently as possible and with as much portability and scalability as can be generated.  I know this is not ideal, but it is a glimpse into my development psychology.  Best practices, in my extremely limited experience, come after a lot of poorly designed applications.</p><p>3.  Further, in my opinion, the official documentation is not really helpful for explaining the usefulness and desirability of App.cfc.  Sure, it provides examples of the different elements, but there is not really a top-down "here's what a full Application.cfc might look like and what it might be used for" description of the file and its application potential (which potential I still do not understand).  Obviously, the documentation is not specifically designed for that, so the docs cannot really be blamed for it.  However, if the "operative imperative" of the newb is remembered, the fact that the docs don't preach the App.cfc gospel AND that App.cfm is providing everything the simple app needs to accomplish its limited purpose, a newb like myself is not going to look much farther.</p><p>I trust that I am not coming across as if I am trying to put the blame on anyone for failing to provide adequate information regarding this.  Obviously, the lion's share resides with me for not investigating these things through the vast resources that are available on the internet.  However, I hope this gives a bit of a glimpse into the psychology of a newb vs. Application.cfc  :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I've suggested you do a CFJUG meeting on the Application.cfc, I find lots of reference to it but no one breaks it down with examples. Thatâ€™s the biggest problem, how is a beginner to know what init is and how to use it.</p><p>Sure I could download others code and use it but I've said it before and I'll say it again "You won't learn it you copy and paste".</p><p>One last thing I vote for my entry of course, do I get a vote?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, Ray, I didn't know a lot about using Application.cfc until I read your write up on it in Fusion Authority Quarterly. I haven't really used it yet as I've only recently gotten into an arena where I'm consistently working in something other than CF5.</p><p>I do keep that issue of FAQu handy though as I intend to use that article as a reference when creating an Application.cfc file.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agree with exists comments....</p><p>1) I had never heard of using application.cfc before this contest - and in my WACK, it isn't even discussed. Granted, I am on CFMX 6 - but it's sort of a valid point. Since my App.cfm works, I wasn't actively looking for other ways to do it. (I still am lost as to how to build one.... My next step I suppose.)</p><p>2) Not having written a CFC before, I wasn't sure what the var was either. (Or what the need for a CFC would be.) I just went through my steps in the WACK and made mine like the first few examples in there. I thought, in general, that using the arguments tag was "secure" enough... My documentation didn't go through that all that well - at least - not that I picked up on it. I just saw it as another way of declaring variables - and redundant at that. It seemed "extra" or Superflous to what I needed to do.</p><p>3) And yeah - sometimes it is about getting it to work. And as a Newb - when you see it work - you're just excited that it does. Application performance is secondary. A) Because of client deadlines. And most importantly B) You don't know how to improve performance.  Thus the "newb" status.</p><p>However, as I have repeatedly said - this was a great excercise for learning some of those points. I know I am already applying my new knowledge and fixing some of my previous efforts. Thanks!</p><p>And yeah.... I vote for mine!  ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting responses guys. By the way - I hope I didn't sound negative. I wasn't trying to say, "What is wrong with these idiots - why aren't they using app.cfm/app.cfc correctly." It was an honest surprise with regards to the usage, nothhing more, especially since the rest of the code was well done.</p><p>And to be clear - I saw issues with App.cfm as well, ie, even those who used App.cfm over App.cfc seemed to use it incorrectly, or what I would consider incorrect. (Again, not trying to sound harsh and if I am, let me know.)</p><p>So as for my CFJUG - my next meeting is on custom tags, but I can definitely talk about App.cfc in the future. I need to _schedule_ the darn CFJUG first though. Someone needs to hold me to a date and force me to present I think. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll hold you to it Ray and I won't stop buggin you, hehe. I emailed you a week or so ago and suggested you do the next CFJUG on the application.cfc. I know in the past I have asked for you to dig more into CFC's and your response was you could talk about CFC's for 3 days and still have stuff to say. Thanks again Ray, set a date and I'm sure many of us will hold you to it.</p><p>PS I vote for mine again, yea that 2 votes!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>re: Application.cfc vs Application.cfm</p><p>as someone else pointed out... in the grand scheme of things, Application.cfc is still a relatively new thing.  obviously, if you're not on CFMX7, you're not using it.</p><p>i also think there's a lot of the "if it's not broke why fix it" mentality.  for a lot of people, Application.cfm works fine, and is their "comfort zone" (having gotten accustomed to using it for the past x number of years).</p><p>i think Application.cfc is going to need more articles written from the perspective of "why it's 'better' than Application.cfm" versus just straight "how to use it" articles.</p><p>but... well speaking of straight "how to use it" articles, i'll take a second to pimp ben nadel's excellent blog entry on using Application.cfc:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bennadel.com%2Fblog%2F726-ColdFusion-Application-cfc-Tutorial-And-Application-cfc-Reference.htm%3A-b7M2K-LtmOOK22F6vAUTjvct-8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/726-ColdFusion-Application-cfc-Tutorial-And-Application-cfc-Reference.htm">http://www.bennadel.com/blo...</a></p><p>as well as my own "riding on ben's coat tails" blog entry that links to an interactive "skeleton" based on ben's entry:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfblog.griefer.com%2Findex.cfm%2Fid%2Fyet_another_Application_cfc_re%3AbqhUzIK6OjaF0vIP8VBqYf-5SX8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cfblog.griefer.com/index.cfm/id/yet_another_Application_cfc_re">http://cfblog.griefer.com/i...</a></p><p>:)</p></div>
