		<div class="comment_text"><p>After Ray's review, I went back and addressed a lot of issues, although I still need to take some of the hard coding out.<br>The new code can be found at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aacr9.com%2Findex%2Fcamdenfamily%2Ftamagotchi%3AJAN7t5mivcm6UrS_MzdBdq_HDJA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.aacr9.com/index/camdenfamily/tamagotchi">www.aacr9.com/index/camdenf...</a></p><p>And I plan to continue to make improvements because this type of project can be used as an example on so many levels.<br>Graphics, CSS, data storage, security.</p><p>As I learn the more, I'd like to use it to showcase the use of Selenium to provide testing, and cfunit or cfcunit to showcase testing from that perspective.<br>I'd like to show how to develop it beginning with a UML diagram.<br>I think it's harder to go from 0 to 10 than from 10 to 20, so I'm toying with the idea of doing a series of Connect presentations with someone, and we would go through the process of setting up a development environment, from downloading the developer's edition of ColdFusion, Eclipse and all the various plug-ins, SQL Server Management Studio Express, Mindmapper, Selenium, cfUnit, cfcUnit, etc.<br>Then developing the Tamagotchi program from a blank ColdFusion page.</p><p>It would be quite a learning experience!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Most excellent. I enjoyed playing with all the enteries.</p><p>One thing I did notice about Phillips entry is that, no matter how far you go with in the game. The creature's hunger never diminishes. I played for 100 turns with a hunger at 512 and it never went down.</p><p>Happiness has a similar bug. If you pet the create to 8/8 it will sit there no matter how many times you press pause. You have to pet the creature to much in order for the happiness to go down.</p><p>Other then those two small bugs, it was a great application. Congrats Phillip you did an excellent job on it.</p></div>
