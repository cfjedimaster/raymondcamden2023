		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nick, your comment is completely unhelpful and - well - is beyond crap. I'm trying to help a company find a new CF developer and I'd like to know how this helps? As for the site itself - it looks fine to me. Shoot, the last two web firms I worked at had great talent, but their own web sites were pretty boring.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This looks like a good opportunity...and I'd love the chance to move back home (Louisiana)...just not so sure I'd want to take a 50% (probably more) cut in pay. I'm guessing salary range for this position is probably in the high 40s (low 50s if you're lucky).</p></div>
