		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is a blurb on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FCNN.com%3Agxgq7L_rKE0y1ChvoWcH89idDuE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="CNN.com">CNN.com</a> this evening about it as well.  They mention fans have sent in over 50,000 pounds of nuts in protest!! Thats crazy!!  CBS executives are going to donate the nuts to charity.</p><p>I think it's pretty cool that a) the fans revolted, and b) the network is going to listen to them and bring back the show.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Like BSG, I'm just glad that this is going to be allowed to have an ending.</p><p>I mentioned that I'd watch serial shows that I know are one or two seasons if they have a good and interesting story.  Just tell us up front.</p><p>A really good quote did come out of this: <br>"I really think that what has been learned here is that networks are going to have to look at numbers and who is watching their show and who is downloading their show in a different way from here on out. I think they have to understand that the Nielsens are not telling the story anymore and that the 18-49 demographic they're all so keen on is online and that's how increasingly they are getting their news and entertainment."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Amen Scott. That was my original complaint. I just want an ending. I don't care if it is a Hitchcock/Leave ya wondering type thing, I want an ending.</p></div>
