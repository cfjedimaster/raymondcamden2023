Haven't dug too deeply but there is a registry change that will let it work with BlogCFC.</p><p>Open regedit</p><p>Click on Edit - Find<br>enter Windows Live Writer<br>expand Weblogs<br>should be IDs - expand those out<br>find your blog and goto manifestOptions<br>delete the characterSet key</p><p>Restart Windows Live Writer</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had no idea XML-RPC was an 'unloved' feature :) I've been using Rob Rohan's cool little blogging plugin for Eclipse (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frobrohan.com%2Fprojects%2Fafae%2F%29%3AqM8tH5be6FLum7suZ3sbOsgqPhw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://robrohan.com/projects/afae/)">http://robrohan.com/project...</a> with BlogCFC for a few weeks and it works great, except that you can't create new categories, which isn't a big deal to me. It lists entries, lets you edit or create new ones, edit metadata etc. all from within Eclipse. Now, if only someone would write a plugin that makes coffee...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - an AIR BlogCFC manager would be sweet.  You really wouldn't even have to bother with xmlrpc because it would be for BlogCFC only and you could control the communications.  Offline support for creating slideshows, adding/editing pages, etc.  Basically an admin tool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For what it is worth - the xml-rpc tools are already built into Word 2007 and are very easy to set up, give you all the power of Word (spell check, grammar, etc), and work with blogCFC perfectly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Love the XML-RPC support, and use it with Live Writer.  Works a treat for English, but not for Japanese - the text is corrupted.  Live Writer does Japanese fine to Blogger and SharePoint blogs, though.<br>I do Japanese updates through the admin screens.</p></div>
