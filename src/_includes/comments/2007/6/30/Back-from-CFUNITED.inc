		<div class="comment_text"><p>wasn't there a 80's movie - The Last Starfighter with the same premise.</p><p>From Wiki: <br>Several schools around the world have adopted Ender's Game as required reading, some for its psychological aspects, others for its science fiction background. Some examples include:</p><p>* The Marine Corps University at Quantico, as a textbook on the psychology of leadership.[1]</p><p>Thanks for the info, guess I'll have to read this one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, you may want to pick up "Ender's Shadow."  It follows the life and development of one of the other Battle School children, and it provides a very different perspective on many of the events in "Ender's Game."  It's very interesting.</p><p>Glad your trip home was uneventful.  The national news media has been reporting that air travel's been pretty bad the last few days due to weather-related flight cancellations and holiday travel.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Logan's Run was an OK read. The movie was essentially right but they of course changed several things, including the ending. I've been told there were two follow up books to Logan's Run but I've never tracked them down and read them.</p><p>I'm heading on a trip soon and have never read Ender's Game, despite having it on my 'to read' list for several decades.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I own the entire Ender series(there are 8 books) and have reread them many times, they are just that good.  I would have to agree with Brian, Enders shadow and the entire "Shadow" Series were some of the best books I have read.  I recommend them to everyone I can that likes to read</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, Ender's Game is a great book, I read this in college in one of my humanities courses.  I couldn't put the book down, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I understand the author wrote other books that build on Ender's Game.  I also hear there will be a movie that covers Ender's Game and Enders Show.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You need to ping Teratech about that. They manage the videos. If you want a personal recreation, I can be hired to do a remote breeze preso. (Not to sound like I'm "selling" myself. I do give free one hour presos from time to time, but for 3 hours, well, that is a bit much. ;)</p></div>
