		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, that brings up an interesting question - with CF8 - how much need is there for "manual" AJAX? I say there will still be a need. As powerful as the AJAX stuff is in CF8, I know I will still - from time to time - need more control and customization than CF8 can provide. Also, I think Spry in this case does the tooltips better, although I like the tabs in CF8 more.</p></div>
