		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know this is nitpicking, but I have to back up Gary on this one. When many of us were lobbying to keep the name Apollo, we were told we were going to get a "really cool" name. AIR doesn't quite make it.</p><p>Still, at least it's one syllable, which is more than can be said for WPF (5, I think!).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>David</p></div>
