		<div class="comment_text"><p>One note here.  Some of the speed increase in CF8 is from the move to Java 6 which has a substantial speed increase by its self.  CFC generation is for sure an example where Adobe has done work to improve performance.  Which is awsome.  CF8 has so much to offer and I love the speed increase with just an upgrade of the server and no code changes needed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Daniel, good point, the new JRE does indeed help and is part if it. One thing I did not point out though is that the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FAdobe.com%3AF-lEhjY67nEyMJ-Pxxz4lVWafuI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Adobe.com">Adobe.com</a> store is faster in CF8, but they are using JRE 1.5, not 1.6 (because of compatibility issues with some other Java stuff they need to run). So even on 1.5 it is faster, on 1.6 it should be even more so.</p><p>--- Ben</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We've taken out the dependencies on Log4J for CF8 - you can drop in whatever version you want to, though you may also have to update your Apache commons-logging to a version which can handle the Log4J version you select.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary - I tend to repeat this story a bit, so if you have heard me say it before, forgive me.</p><p>When I first ran RIAForge under CF8 - it loaded so fast I was convinced it was broken and I was looking at the error handler. I was -convinced-. Imagine my surprise when I saw that it really did run that fast - and ran well.</p></div>
