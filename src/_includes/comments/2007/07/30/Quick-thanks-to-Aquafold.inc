		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is my favorite DB tool even though it isn't free. I got it for $120 back when they had deal in Jan. It is a great tool especially if you work with different DB types like MS SQL and MySQL at the same time. It is also cross platform which is great.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I second that!  I've been using ADS for about a year now, and I've had great success managing SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and Informix instances...at the same time...on the same box!  I love the versatility of the tool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've heard great things about ADS, but have never tried it because I can't justify the investment.  It's great to hear that they're stepping up to support the OSS community.  There are a lot of ways to support OSS development and this one is particularly generous.</p></div>
