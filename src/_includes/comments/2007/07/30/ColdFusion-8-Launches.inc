		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chris - do you NEED the enterprise edition? If I were you, and was trying to "sell" the boss, I wouldn't start with the price - I'd make sure he/she was sold on the features. If he/she is not, there's probably no need to consider enterprise.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>David</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi all,</p><p>So...  the question of the day... what do we mean by limiting the gateways... and what do we mean by the EFR in general.</p><p>Okay, here's the deal... with ColdFusion 8, we decided that we wanted ANY ColdFusion application to run on ANY ColdFusion server.</p><p>Now... so wait a second... you're saying I can do anything?<br>Yes, we decided that everyone should have access to gateways and all of the new features.</p><p>So then what's the deal with this EFR thing?<br>Well... the EFR manages all requests from the Standard implementation to the Enterprise features (we essentially made a tunnel).  This provides full compatibility, but does so by using just one thread to manage all of the calls.  So, if you want to use CFEXCHANGE and CFPDF at the same time... one will have to wait for the other... the second request queues until the first is complete.</p><p>As for gateways, the number of threads for incoming messages is limited to 1 and outgoing messages get routed through the EFR.  It's that simple, no big trick.</p><p>So, use the gateways and all the new features, enjoy them, show off how cool ColdFusion is!!!</p><p>Here's the catch (if you can call it that)... should your application become wildly successful... (which I hope it does... that's good for all of us)... like you finally get your entire corporation to love SMS or you turn all of your paper processes into using PDF Forms... then you will want to upgrade to Enterprise to get those awesome new applications to scale.  A few requests here and there will work in Standard perfectly, but if the server is chugging these requests all the time... then its time to upgrade. :)</p><p>I think its the coolest thing that ColdFusion applications will be able to run on ANY ColdFusion server.  Hopefully you all will agree.</p><p>Cheers, :)<br>Jason</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry!  I should have made that more clear too... EFR stands for Enterprise Feature Router.  It routes all of the requests from a Standard server to the features that we otherwise would have classified as Enterprise features, to provide full compatibility. :)</p><p>I hope that makes sense.</p></div>
