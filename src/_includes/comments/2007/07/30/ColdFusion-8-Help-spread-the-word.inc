		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, you can hear the gap widening now!  Well done, Adobe, of gaining more support and customers!  Wow, this should put CF right over the top of RoR.  Looks like I'll be switching because this is going to bankrupt me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It really bugs me (the hate I mean). While I don't use PHP, I've played with it in the past. It isn't a bad technology. If I didn't have CF, I could see using it, and not hating it at all. I can respect PHP coders and their solutions to their problems.</p><p>What I can't respect is the PHP folks who feel the need to bash everything that isn't theirs. Real mature. I just hope they are the vocal cry baby minority.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jason - I posted a few comments to the thread... but I had to stop. I can't do it. I just can't take the hate. Maybe I'm weak that way (too much teasing in high school for being fat), but I can't look at those comments and NOT take it personally. (I know - I don't even work for Adobe, but ColdFusion is my baby. ;)</p></div>
