		<div class="comment_text"><p>How about checking for IP addresses and time stamps?  If you detect 3, 4, or more vote posts in rapid succession within 1 minute or something like that from a single IP, that's a good chance that this is an auto vote machine.  Check for these variables, and throw out these vote posts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A problem with ip checks is folks behind firewalls and NAT.  Can't say for sure that IP X has voted 50 times, that could be legit votes from different people.</p><p>Most everyone knows the clear cookie trick for voting already.</p><p>I've tried hashing the useragent and ip address to guess if it is the same person.  That works for home users but most networks will have some set image with the same useragent string on each machine or have the firewall strip out the useragent data.</p><p>I can't wait to read what the community comes up with as to "real world" suggestions for handling this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm going to venture to say that you'll never stop someone determined enough. I mean, we still haven't solved voter fraud where there is actually a persons face to look at. With that said, sort of having everyone get a verifiable client certificate (PKI), there's not a real way to verify 1 vote per person.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A Flex/Flash based voting system would probably make it tough to autovote from a DOM perspective, but it would be totally vulnerable to a macro-based screen recording/playback program.</p><p>However, the limitations of those kinds of systems are that they often are based on the physical location of clicks. So randomize things up. Change the ordering of the entries and the "Vote" buttons.</p><p>I saw this technique used on shareware in the past. The "Try" and "Buy" buttons would sometimes swap positions, making a macro to automate the clicking of the "Try" button a bit frustrating. :-)</p><p>Used in combination with some other afore-mentioned techniques, and it'd be a frustrating system to hack..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know that if we could solve this problem, then we could begin voting in elections online, though admittedly there are a few more problems with that sort of thing that current online voting systems wouldn't have to deal with (like age verification, citizenship verification, etc.)</p><p>The SMS suggestion reminds me of the old BBS Callback Verifier days!
