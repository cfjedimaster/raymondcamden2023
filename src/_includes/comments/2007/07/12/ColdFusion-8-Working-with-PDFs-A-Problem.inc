		<div class="comment_text"><p>I guess what you're seeing happen makes sense since I'd assume CF would have to work with the PDF in some native data structure to be effective.  That being said, you'd think the default output format would be binary when the PDF is asked to serialize itself.  Cool find.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, I hope folks don't mind. I swear I'm not doing it for link bait. A few weeks ago I was working with a friend, got a bit stressed, and said something like, "I just can't concentrate. I'm too concerned about Paris." This was during her incarceration. It was funny - and now it is just sticking. I'm sure I'll switch back to Star Wars refs soon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't been tripped up by it yet, but I have run across similar issues in the past. Specifically, at one point I was storing PDFs as base-64 encoded strings in a DB (yeah, not efficient, but it was special circumstances)... I had to do a lot of toBinary() and cfcontent-ing to get it all to work.</p><p>Same general idea here...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know this particular entry was about a problem you were having, but it got me started on fixing a problem I was having and I had to take a break to write this.  Sometimes CF gets me so excited about solving a problem, that I practically have an anxiety attack getting started.  And the options seem endless again.  Does that ever happen to you?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, I've spent more late nights working on cool (well to me) CF ideas than playing video games. ColdFusion - not just a language - a passion! ;)</p></div>
