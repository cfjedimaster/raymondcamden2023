		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice work Ray. A question...what did you use to determine uniqueness? I think MXNA uses the GUID which changes whenever people update their blogs across versions or software which makes for the fairly regular "blog puking" as I call it when all the old posts suddenly show up at once. Goog uses the title from what I can tell which means that if you have two posts with the same title, the newer one doesn't show (which I noticed when my original open source update posts had the same name thus I added the date). Curious how you approach this problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't quite get your meaning here Charlie. I do re-use index.cfm for my search results, just like BlogCFC does. But that isn't an AJAX issue at all. It is just me reusing the same template. If your search returns N pages, the links show that I also allow passing the search term via the query string. So one change I could make would be to switch my FORM to a GET, although that's not technically valid. Either way - it isn't an AJAX issue though. Or are you talking about my _plans_ to add more AJAX? Or just AJAX driven search results in general?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I think you may be reading more into this than I meant. I'm not referring to any previous discussions we've had about BlogCFC and bookmarking search results.</p><p>I simply meant that many who build such Ajax apps may create their CFDIV (or whatever control) so that all the server interaction occurs within that control, and the user would never see a URL changing (much like when one uses an iframe).</p><p>I was just bringing that challenge to people's attention. In your case, I see that indeed the next/prev links cause a regular page request (where the URL changes to reflect it). I just hadn't noticed that, so one could look at that link to get the URL to bookmark.</p><p>But if you had instead designed those next/prev links to refresh the control holding the results instead, then this issue I mention would be something to note.</p><p>I wasn't attacking any choice you made. I just thought it interesting to note that some Ajax apps may indeed do new page requests without exposing a (changing) URL to the user, that's all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In general - I like it. But I have some problems with the way queries are made. If you look at Paragator, one of the things I do is copy values over into common columns. That way I can always use one column for the link, for example, no matter what feed type it is. In my humble opinion, CFFEED should have done this for me. Now _normally_ I think people will use hard coded FEED urls and won't be doing it dynamically like I am.</p><p>THere is also a bug with some feeds not reporting dates correctly. But in the 290 or so feeds I aggregate, this was a small minority.</p><p>All in all - I'm VERY happy it was added, I'd just tweak it a bit for CF9. :)</p></div>
