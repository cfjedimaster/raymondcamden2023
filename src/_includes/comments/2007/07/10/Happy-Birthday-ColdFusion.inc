		<div class="comment_text"><p>My first experience with ColdFusion was three years ago when I got a job with a research study who was running their data collection, participant scheduling and study management using CFMX 6.1 with a MS SQL database.  I started the job part-time as I finished up my Masters in CS at Pitt.  Up until then, I had done most of my coding in C++ and Java for projects in school, and I hadn't played with much else, but I was able to become comfortable with CF in just a few weeks.</p><p>In fact, CF won me over so much that just a year later I was taking my CF 7 Certification exam and not looking back.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I came a bit late on the scene compared to you Ray.  My first experience with Coldfusion was 4.5 back in June of 2000.  I had been developing in ASP prior to that and hating every minute of it!</p><p>I got a contract at a Government site in Washington DC and got my first taste of Coldfusion and thought "It can't possibly be this easy can it?" as it turns out it was, and still is and like you never looked back.  Until that is, I moved to Germany, where CF is virtually unknown, and the market terrifyingly small.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>95-96. I had been tinkering with HTML/Perl and at work began tinkering with IIS. At the time ASP was just coming out as well.  I took a look at that but it was too hard to figure out :) I dug around a bit and found Cold Fusion!  Comparing the code it took to do simple queries and form based things it both languages it was a no-brainer on which one to pick! I initially replaced a few Mac based Filemaker applications, and went on to build a corporate Intranet for the company.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My last company had an in-house programming language that was very similiar to CF, on a more basic level, and that's what I started out with when I switched over to programming from web design (html).  For a variety of reasons, the in-house language was abandoned in favor of CF and gradually moved over to ColdFusion with each new project.  I think we started out with 4.5, or 5, can't rememer which version it was when we started working with ColdFusion.  But my knowledge of the language really grew once Sean came up with a way to install CF on OS X systems (thanks, Sean!) and I was able to install it on my laptop so I could play with it at home (kept too busy working on projects to really experiment at work).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Coldfusion was the first server-side script I learnt while I was doing an ecommerce course after coming out of my Business School (M.B.A in Systems and Marketing). I was truly amazed of its easiness and power. It was version 4.0 and year was 2000. My interest over it increased in double after learning the next server-side technology which is ASP coming under same course. I became a Coldfusion addict and I spend most of my time in computer lab doing small apps using coldfusion while my colleges used to tease me saying that it don’t have much job scope as Indian market was dominated by MS and Sun Java. I never listened them and developed my first shopping store which was a small book store in the same lab.</p><p>After the course I placed  as a Coldfusion developer in a company associated with the same computer education center and I worked on a portal in coldfusion 4.5 with that company and left to Mumbai in search of better opportunities and funny thing is that I got job there as a PHP developer :)</p><p>After working for 1 year with them I return back to my home town and started my own consultancy. I initially picked PHP as my tool of trade as I targeted small customers and later when my business grown I eventually picked Coldfusion again which was still my favorite in my heart. The year was 2002 and since then no look back...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My first time with Coldfusion was in my last I held before graduating college back in '99.  I had taken a little gig working on a defense contractor's website and they taught me Coldfusion (version 4.0) on the job.  Up until that point I had been working in C++ and Perl mainly.</p><p>The funny thing was, I had taken the job there working on websites only to get my foot in the door to work in one of their simulation and training teams, developing in C++.  I was hooked, and within 6 months I was working full time for an emerging dot com working with CF full time.</p><p>I haven't looked back once!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I too began with Perl, but moved to ASP, then PHP and finally found ColdFusion with Macromedia's acquisition of Allaire in v5.  I wasn't too impressed at first, but v6 had me fully converted from its beta stages and I now program ColdFusion and ASP full time.  Ideally, the ASP will eventually go away, but I have no plans to go to .NET or JSP any time soon with CF8 around the corner.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started out doing freelance web design around 2000, and the first couple of clients I took on were using CF, so I had to learn it.  As I started to pick it up, other clients wanted more functionality in their websites, so I bought the Allaire CF 4.5 boxed set of manuals and went to work.</p><p>I only really appreciated the beauty of CF after starting a new position where the boss had written a bunch of PHP scripts that I inherited.  What a nightmare compared to programming in CF!</p><p>It took months but I convinced the boss to go CF for our next shopping cart launch.  A year later we are ultra-nimble and are enjoying a tremendous advantage over our non-CF competitors, as our time-to-market for new site features is virtually nil, and I am the only developer on staff, easily handling the entire site front to back.  Thanks and happy birthday CF!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My first experience with ColdFusion was back around 1999 during the big Y2K scare. The company I worked for had a DOS application that used a dbase database I believe, that they wanted converted. They had been using ColdFusion for a while but the other developer and myself hadn't had a chance to use it. In fact, I hadn't even wrote any HTML let alone ColdFusion, as I started out writing and supporting Access applications and working with MSSQL 6.5. Anyway, we asked for some training and what we received from them was a CD from Allaire that taught you the basics in about 30 minutes. From that point forward the other developer and myself figured out that ColdFusion was probably the coolest damn thing we had ever used!!!</p><p>Happy Birthday CF!!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started back with version 2, late 1995 I think.  I had an accident (not car) where I crushed my ankle and could no longer do the job I had.  I needed to find a new career so I started reading books about this internet thing and this other thing called HTML.  I got a gig doing a website for a company and a friend of mine said "You should do that in ColdFusion".  I have not looked back since.</p><p>--Dave</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok. Now here's the behind-the-scenes story of how Ray was introduced to Cold Fusion. As the President and co-founder of Einstein Digital Media, I was attending Internet World in 1996 (which was held in Los Angeles that year). I was walking by the Allaire booth when I noticed that they were offering really cool t-shirts as giveaways. And although I really couldn't care less about their software, I sat through their presentation in the belief that I'd get a free t-shirt if I hung around during their dog and pony show. Low and behold, as I was soon to discover, the t-shirts were used as bait to get people to sit down! Only a few folks received a t-shirt in the end of the presentation! The agony of it all!</p><p>Not to be foiled, I stuck around and chatted up some marketing guy, making him think that my Web design company would be really interested in a product like his and that we were really shaking the trees in terms of technology use and client acquisition. To make a large story short, my ploy worked beautifully. He gave me a free t-shirt. He also gave me an evaluation copy of Cold Fusion so that I could it back to our programmers. When I returned to Louisiana, I dropped the box off on Ray's desk and told him something like, "When you get a minute, check out this software and see if it's any good." The rest is history.</p><p>BTW, I kept the t-shirt for myself.</p></div>
