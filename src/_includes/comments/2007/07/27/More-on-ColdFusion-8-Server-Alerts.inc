		<div class="comment_text"><p>Question:  I'm pretty new to ColdFusion, but am more experienced running J2EE type boxes.  I'm trying to set up a ColdFusion dev server on a VM with limited memory, and I'm trying to trim it back so that it doesn't pork out and use every bit of memory on any computer within a 10 mile radius.  I.e. trying to get it so that it perhaps doesn't fire up all of the Flash remoting servlets or other things I don't need for basic CF functionality, in hopes that this might trim back the RAM usage.  Any help you might be able to be on this?</p></div>
