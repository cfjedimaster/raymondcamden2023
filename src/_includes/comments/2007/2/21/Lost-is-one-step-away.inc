		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought tonight's episode was good.  I do not recall what 3 questions were answered, and it was a weird back story, but I was not really disappointed.... ABC is always making previews look like one thing, but something totally different happens so I take the previews and teasers with a grain of salt</p></div>

I bet the reason everyone will be talking next week is because they tell us nothing...AGAIN.  I used to want to watch because I wanted to see what was going to happen, now I find myself watching because I have invested so much time, it would be a waste to not stick it out.</p><p>However, I think Jericho turned it up  few notches with the episode tonight.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It wasn't bad, but I just started watching Lost a few episodes ago.  I actually like what I've seen so far.  This episode did have more loose ends then the others.  So is this the way it works.. Each episode focuses on one character where they go back in time showing prior events.  Is that how every episode is?</p></div>

I ended up watching the first two seasons in the fall in about a two week span to check out what all the hubbub was about, and things definitely flowed together better than the one episode, week of conjecture I'm back to now.</p><p>But yea, the back story to this one wasn't very good at all...Jack's character deserved a better telling.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the story was fine.  It was a basic down to earth story.   It was not as detailed as some stories, but I think that is because in a future Jack story they will fill in more of the details so that story will really make sense.  IE Did he go there right after he turned his dad in?  Was it because his wife left him... I am sure they will tie it into something in the future.  I think last night's episode was great.</p><p>-Randy</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think last nights story showed that throughout his life, Jack has a history of problems when dealing with women.  It seems that he always gets close to someone, screws it up and then realizes what a big mistake he has made.  You can see it with his wife, Kate, the Asian woman and probably the woman from the others (can't remember her name) that he just saved from death.</p><p>It does kind of annoy me that his character is always trying to rescue women.  It's almost like a compulsion to him.  To me, he thinks that without his help or influence--all the women he meets would be doomed.  I realize he is a doctor, but he's not God.</p><p>Overall, last nights episode was not bad.  I just really like Lost better when more of the core characters are involved.  I'd also like a return of some of the more Sci-Fi elements.</p></div>

I'm sick and tired of wasting my time watching a show that is nothing but (boring) melodrama wrapped around a huge MacGuffin.  Nothing was advanced plotwise last night, no questions were answered.  I want the 42 minutes I spent in front of my TiVo back.</p><p>The first season hooked me.  I held on to hope during the second season, and now?  I'm finished.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the 3rd question was "Was Cindy an other?" but it's irrelevant because the producers said they only intended 1 question - the tattoo question - to really be answered. It was ABC that hyped the other 2 things in the promos.</p><p>So Jack is a "Stranger in a strange land" does that make him an inside man with the others that will enable the losties to get the upper hand.

I'm bracing myself for this story to turn in to another Matrix 3. One where at the end they throw out all pretense of originality and it turns out to be just another twist on the second coming of Jesus. Only this time Jack is "the one".

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only thing I hope is that the show doesn't become another X-files, and compared to that steaming pile of crap I would say Lost is more than one step away.  The first two episodes this month were rock solid, just because this one wasn't everything you wanted is no reason to whine about it.  On the contrary it shows you're more hooked than ever, but I do find it humorous that so many of you geeks have this sense of entitlement when it comes to TV entertainment.  For myself, I rather like the idea of turning the amperage down for an episode while we take in the fact that Desmond traveled through time and that cold bitch might be human after all.  I'm sure the next mind bender is just around the corner and then it will be nothing but praise again...Such is the power of Lost.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm glad it's not just me.  I was really into this show for a season and a half. But for crying out loud, we're on a deserted island...how do people just keep showing up out of the woodwork (and I mean on the beach, not even the "others").  And do the others have supernatural powers, or not (they know everything about everyone, but don't have access to medical care???)  My wife is still hanging with it, but I think I'm done after last night.  I think this is a clear example of writers who had a fantastic idea for a pilot, and were able to muddle through a full season, but had no idea where it was going, and now we're all paying the price.  It's definitely starting to feel X-files-esque.</p></div>
