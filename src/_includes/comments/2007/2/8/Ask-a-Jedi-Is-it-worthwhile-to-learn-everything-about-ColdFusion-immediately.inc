		<div class="comment_text"><p>I personally don't think that you can pick up a book and learn the advanced parts of languages.  However, you can learn the syntax of advanced coding from books.   Learning the advanced parts of a language comes from experience.  Yea, you can read and learn how to do advanced stuff, with CFCs for example.  But, does a book tell you when and how to actually use them?</p><p>I would start with the basics.  Once you have got a good grasp of them then start moving into the more advanced parts.</p><p>My 2 cents.</p><p>--Dave<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkferguson.com%2FBlogCFC%3A67yso0XlaG-QRADNTx1jag04z08&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dkferguson.com/BlogCFC">http://www.dkferguson.com/B...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Also don't dismiss a home-grown 'framework'  I have tried Model-glue and fusebox, and I find my brain just flows along better using my own methodology.  CFC's will save your butt and make things re-usable, and don't underestimate the importance of a good well-thought out directory structure =)  A bit of planning on paper will make your later code much easier to go through and change / fix.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think some techniques are labeled as advanced for a reason.</p><p>Will "advanced" techniques make your coding better? Maybe so, but I don't think they are essential to getting started.</p><p>My first ColdFusion application was a collection of worst practices. Still, in less than a month I had an application that was well-received in my organization.</p><p>From there, I learned better techniques (much of that from the pain of trying to maintain that first application).

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of the key selling points of Coldfusion, at least to me, is that one can become very productive, very quickly in it. That right there makes me think that you don't have to become "advanced" right away. In fact, as you said, you learn you need something like frameworks once you've been doing it for awhile.</p><p>I say let people come in, use it, maybe even use it badly. When they learn that they need more, be ready to point them in the right direction.</p><p>I would argue, however, that moving security issues (like using cfqueryparam to block sql injection) into the "basics" might be a good idea.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To somewhat echo what dave said, experience really is the best teacher.</p><p>I have been developing cf for 7+ year now (jeez, has it really been that long??) and I still learn new and better ways of doing things every single day.</p><p>I can look at an application I wrote as little as 2 months ago and think to myself about all the ways I would change that code if I rewrote it again now.  Most of it is not things that would make a noticable difference in the application or maybe even its performance, but it might make a difference to me in maintainability.</p><p>So I guess what I am saying is, learn what you can when you can, but don't worry about trying to absorb it all at once.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Everyone has made great points even Ray =) but as I near my one year anniversary in the switch to ColdFsuion from PHP I can say Ray is right. My blog started out a very simple piece of code but as I learn and grow with ColdFusion my blog is becoming more advanced and secure.</p><p>The best advice I can gove so someone just learning ColdFusion is take on side projects, design and develop ColdFusion Software that you can use to learn and grow with.</p><p>Right now I'm developing CF Link Exchange System free and open source of cource but I know 6 months from now when I go back and look over my code I will say "what was I thinking". As my blog matures I see it every week, what was I thinking when I did it this way, and then rewrite code with the knowledge I learned since I wrote it.</p><p>Like Ryan said trying to learn CF all at once won't happen, but keep at it and ask questions (hehe Ray) is the best resouce for learning ColdFusion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Echoing the sentiments above, I think learning the core, as well as the syntax is a much better approach than diving into the advanced topics. And I think we all can agree that making mistakes is one of the best ways to become a better programmer. "Advanced" techniques don't mean much if you don't know *why* you would use them; i.e. it's very difficult to see why you'd want to use a framework until you develop a site with a ton of page controllers and spaghetti code. I don't think any book, website or mailing list can give you that "a-ha!" moment you need to really "get" some of the more advanced topics like experience can (though it can't hurt!)</p><p>Learning multiple languages is a great way to shorten the gap between picking up the syntax and language basics, and being ready to tackle the more advanced aspects of the language. In fact, once you learn advanced techniques in one language, it's often much, much easier to apply those to another language once you learn the basics.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I would become aware of the advanced topics, so that if something comes up I can say "oh, you know what?  I remember reading about this some place.  Let me go look at what it had to say."</p><p>No need to go in depth if time is an issue, I would think.  Of course, if he's got plenty of experience developing applications anyway, I don't think it is as important if he has none.</p><p>Finally, I'd skip the framework for now.  If you've already got a hodgepodge of code, using a framework would have alleviated that, but I don't see it helping now, short of using even more time to get the product out the door.</p><p>Of course, you'll be paying back all the technical debt you've accrued, with interest.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it's also a matter of background.  For example, I just got back from Taiwan, where a co-worker and I spent two weeks teaching ColdFusion to a team of .Net developers.  We had a specif goal - for them to develop an application in mach-ii that would fit in our customer portal.</p><p>Since they all had programming backgrounds, we didn't have to spend time teaching basic programming concepts.  We were able to focus on the ColdFusion basics - setting variables, writing queries, passing around parameters, http get and post, data structures, and then move on to components.</p><p>We didn't teach much about mach-ii other than the basic.  The point is that once you know one language, learning another language is often just a matter of syntax, and knowing what's available to make doing a particular task easier.  In our case, we taught them enough CF to get going, and through code reviews, are helping them to learn faster ways to do things using ColdFusion's awesome array of tags and functions.</p><p>Note that we did not explicitly teach them about ColdFusion's security framework, as our customer portal handles the majority of security for the app.  We did teach cfqueryparam and data type checking and exception and error handling, though.</p><p>So far, after having taught several groups using this approach, we've found that it works reasonably well for our needs.</p><p>As with anything, though, the more time you have, the better.  Also, there's no better teacher than experience, and no better way to gain experience than by doing.</p></div>

Because I had programming experience when I started using Coldfusion I thought I could skim the basics and get right into the advanced features.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Steve,</p><p>We always include CFCs in our training, since all of our applications are written using them.</p><p>For some training we did last year with developers in the Philippines, where the programmers had little development experience, we started off with the Fast Track to CF class (delivered remotely using RoundPeg).  After that class, Adam Crump and I went to the Philippines and followed up (about 2 weeks later) with more training, but this time focused exclusively on CFEclipse, CVS, and CFC based development.</p><p>What's interesting is that we use Mach-II, and are able to get developers working within the framework without really understanding all of the ins and outs of the framework.  This only works on certain types of applications, and mainly because the apps are being built to fit in an already existing portal that has a lot of services already built.</p><p>But to answer your question, I do think that CFCs can be taught as part of the basics.  CFCs themselves are pretty simple to learn - it's their application that can take a lot more time, practice, and experience to master.  I'm reminded of Ray's example of the "uber-CFC" vs how a CFC would be used in a fully OO MVC style environment.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me, the best way to learn is to dive in and do it, experience the problems, and then learn the advanced solutions (like why I need a framework) as I go. That's not always fun, but it sure burns it into your mind! <br>Learning CFCs should be essential, I'm sure they are a lot easier to wrap your head around if you learn them from the beginning, rather than learning to write procedural code and then having to unlearn that later. I still feel like I'm unlearning all the CF5 stuff I started with.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having been writing CF code for nearly 10 years (YIKES!) - I have coem to realize that this language never fails to challenge me, each and every project. There is ALWAYS something "new"/"advanced" to learn...  I started with very basics (back in the CF3/4.5 days) all the way up to OOP in MX7.  I echo the general sentiment I have seen in these comments... get the basics down first, be "aware" of the more advanced techniques, be aware of the frameworks available (and ones that are in development, but most importantly... KEEP LEARNING.  We (CF Developers) are a huge community that are very open (at least mostly) to sharing what we learn and know and do in CF.  Ask questions.  Unlike some languages, we have a great resource in each other, those on the Adobe Teams (Hi Ben!), high speed developers (Hi Ray!) and so many more the list would be a blog entry of it's own.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There's one "advanced technique" I'd push pretty hard right from the beginning - automated unit testing.  It's sometimes assumed it only applies to testing objects, but it can work pretty well for just a simple data-driven web site as well.  Obviously you don't test for all your page layout, but you can look for link targets and output of data fields.</p><p>Then it doesn't matter how awful your code is - you can refactor with confidence, and your fresh noob app is less likely to turn into one of those legacy Big Balls of Mud we all keep on our least favourite server.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am a couple of years into ColdFusion now and started out with just the simple basic templates with some forms, queries, and other elements which are used in just about every site I develop.  As a matter of fact, CF is my first language (I think that individuals with experience in other languages certainly have an advantage when adopting new languages, including CF.  For instance, concepts in JS and AS have made much more sense to me having been working with CF.).  I, like many, used CFWACK as my primary introduction to learning CF.  What I have come to realize is that when I begin to separate what is a web site from what is a web application I find that more advanced topics need be learned in order to accommodate an application's requirements.  So I look at problems of an "advanced" nature from an application specific point of view.  This for me translates into the more applications I work on, the more CF I learn.  At the same time it becomes easy to recognize how reusable CF is from application to application.  Certainly I want to become better at what I am doing with CF but it is not realistic to think that you can know everything about CF.  I think CF, as with any programming language, is a continuing study that one will learn something new regardless of how long one has been writing CF.  Plus it would get boring if you new it all - don't you think?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would like to say that good habits should be taught as part of the basics. Bad habits should be touched upon as well. CFCs should definitely be included, as you can't teach good habits without them. Now with that said, I am relearning Coldfusion to separate the business logic from the presentation from the application I wrote and our company uses to provide services to clients. And by moving the BL into CFCs when I am done I hope to be smart enough and in a good position to use seme Flex to make some front end components. Looks like the CFWACK7 is a great resource as to what defines the basics. After writing CF for seven years (not my full time occupation) there are things I am picking up in the very beginning of that book. Thank you Ben Forta and Ray Camden =D</p></div>
