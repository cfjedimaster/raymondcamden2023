		<div class="comment_text"><p>The first half of Rob's preso was essentially my Managing ColdFusion Components with Factories talk that I gave at a number of CFUGs last year and at cf.Objective() and CFUNITED. The second half of his preso was essentialy what Dave Ross and Chris Scott were touting last year (the IOC and AOP stuff). Glad that it gave you food for thought tho'...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very funny Sean; I would have loved to hear your comments had you assisted my preso, but I don't remember seeing you there. I had one of your slides and one from Dave, but you could see for yourself once I post the final slides and code. Make sure to download the podcast so you can get a better feeling of what you missed.</p><p>Cheers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rob, I was referring to the slide printouts in the Frameworks Conference booklet. I'm not saying that basing your material on mine and Dave's / Chris's was in any way wrong, merely that it wasn't new material - it was stuff that was presented at last year's CFUNITED. I'm always happy for people to use my material to create their own presos.</p><p>And anyone looking at your slide printout in the booklet and my old factories talk will see a lot more than one slide's worth of common material...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The community certainly appreciates your open and selfless contributions. You're right; the printouts were part of an initial draft which was later modified, adding code examples, reverse engineering of open source applications, step by step architecture process and thought flow to better explain the reasons for those who never experienced the problems factories solve.</p></div>
