Thanks Ray! :P</p><p>I've had CS on my dev box for awhile now and its still one of those I need to get some free time to play with this. Maybe I'll try to dive into it this afternoon some, it sounds really interesting.</p><p>reading all these though makes me yearn to bust out of this procedural-eaque framework we use atm haha.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Life without ColdSpring sucks!</p><p>When I was learning ColdSpring I remember struggling with what I needed to add to my components to get the right composition.  get set methods, init-constructors, it was a little bit confusing to get started.</p><p>Now, I am suprised by how much code I don't need to write to get what I want. I've actually worked on Apps that are so heavily configured by ColdSpring, it is possible to make an entire new application by just moving the XML declarations around.</p><p>Having an App built around ColdSpring makes it super easy to change the location of the components and in the case of using a prebuilt app, if I want it in another directory, I simply edit the ColdSpring.xml and I am not bound to the original paths the Author built upon.</p><p>It is helpful to have a good instance factory so you can manage your instance objects as well.  the makeEventBean command in ModelGlue will take a path, or a reference, so thank you Joe R. for that little feature...</p><p>&amp;lt;sung_to_the_tune of="Jingle Bells" /&amp;gt;<br>Oh what fun it is to code, with ColdSpring in your day...</p><p>Ok, that was lame..</p></div>
