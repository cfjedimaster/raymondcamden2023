		<div class="comment_text"><p>T and I will start watching it tonight, for the first time.</p><p> We've finally caught up on the previous seasons (DVD) and downloaded the first few episodes of this season.</p><p> I guess it'll be our first episode we see as it airs as opposed to playing catch up.</p><p> I think a lot of the appeal of the serial type series is lost when you watch 2-4 episodes back to back, so Lost hasn't grabbed me the same way that Heroes has.</p><p> But, I'm interested enough to keep watching.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm kind of the opposite, I'd prefer to sit down with 3-4 episodes and watch it in bulk. I hate following these serial shows in hour segments.</p><p>As far as Lost, they need to step it up to get some of their fans back imo. All these hiatuses and breaks over the past two seasons gets tiring.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Greg - In my opinion, BSG and Heroes (and even 24 so far) are, this season, far better than LOST. (Personally, I think BSG is the best show on TV)</p><p>I feel like there was not much added to the story in the first half of the season, and too much time spent on Jack, Kate and Sawyer, and way too little spent on what happened at the hatch and how it would affect everyone on the island(s).</p><p>While I don't see myself abandoning LOST, if things don't get better, it will come off my 'must watch the night it airs' list. (Which currently only includes 4 shows: BSG, Heroes, 24 and LOST)</p><p>@Michael - 24 has aired all episodes, without a break, for at least the last 3 seasons.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Come the end of the first half(really, what is the break about?) my partner and I found that we are loosing interest. The fractured storyline which really has to many plots which never seem end are getting frustrating to follow. I like the the questions raised but also you have to answer them at some point.</p><p>Though i'm not giving up. The second half of this season could still be a surprise, though my fear is that this could turn into an X-files scenario where the show gets too big and no season finally will be a satisfying!</p></div>
