		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Doug - that is so lame! I'm sorry to hear that. <br>To the general public: when you fill out these forms, it's polite to give constructive feedback, and please don't take it out on the speaker that *you* were not interested in their content.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Doug - Boring? No way, you were one of the most energetic and dynamic speakers there.</p><p>@Ray - You were energetic and dynamic as well.  I did attend a few sessions where I was interested in the topic but the speaker did not engage the audience.  Still, I wouldn't classify that as boring.  Thanks for sharing your wealth of knowledge with us.</p></div>
