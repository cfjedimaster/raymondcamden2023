		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, I thought I'd just bring this to your attention.. The "Print" link on your blog has some style issue that causes the  PDF version of the articles to come out all text centered. I'll print your blog posts and read them during lunch a lot, and it's driving me loopy. ;-) I assume this centering was not intentional..</p><p>Josh</p></div>
