		<div class="comment_text"><p>Doug, for now it is CFUNITED, with the Frameworks Conf being a close second. I have heard -very- good things about CFObjective, but as I haven't gone yet, I can't say if it is the best.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you knew the things I had to go through to get to the Frameworks conference you would understand why I am not going to CFUnited.</p><p>In sum, I flew in and arrived the morning of, stayed one night in a cheap Motel 8, and then flew out Friday afternoon and missed the last two meetings. I had my flight re-routed on the way there and back and was put up in a hotel Friday night and missed a VERY, VERY important meeting on Saturday morning (it was a church service, and I was supposed to be the preacher). The tight schedule and cheap motel was necessary to reduce costs so my work would actually send me.</p><p>I have to prove to my employer that it was worth it and there is not enough time between now and CFUnited. But if I could go, I would definitely be there!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Since my work will only pay for one conference, and they're [currently] willing to pay for one as expensive as CFUnited or event MAX, I usually go to those. CFObjective sounds great since it's more advanced, plus I'm sick of going to D.C. I'm hoping to win the CFObjective giveaway by ColdFusion Weekly. :-) Then maybe work will let me go. ;-)</p></div>
