		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well I know, Ray, this will just be another reason to switch everything to a Mac someday. What I would is uninstall the drivers for your audio card through the Hardware Profile and actually physically delete the profile for your sound card, and reboot, then reinstall the latest drivers/software from your audio board manufaturer.</p></div>

I had a few audio software titles that I used to use for making the ColdFusion Weekly that typically mucked with my settings.  I have "upgraded" away from all of those titles nowadays.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Look into Microsoft's "devcon" software.  You can use it to restart the hardware drivers for devices based on their PIC vendor string.  (It's easier than it sounds.)  I have to occasionally kick my wireless drivers, and wrote a blog entry about it earlier this week.  It details where and how to get devcon:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frickosborne.org%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D119%3AqvhwupuhpjOS3szRzkEB2XYNGy4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rickosborne.org/blog/?p=119">http://rickosborne.org/blog...</a></p><p>-R</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I wouldn't be too hasty to rush to mac to solve all your audio woes! after a month the switch in the audio jack broke in my brand new macbook pro 15", so if i take the headphones out, it thinks there is a digital line plugged in, and there is no way in OSX to tick a box saying play through my speakers regardless. so it always thinks something is plugged in and will never give me audio from the speakers :( i've rung apple service centre, and they said they have to keep it minimum 10 days for them to even look at it or $200 charge to have them look at it same day...and then no guarantees... this is unacceptable as it's a work machine and needed 24x7, so i guess i'll have broken audio forever. (this is a common issue with the laptops too! apparently it's a 15 min fix to replace a small circuit board, but the service centre refused to pre-order the part for me for a quick fix!)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I've been having the same problem with my Sony Vaio with WinXP Pro.  At least, the audio was initially gone totally, but I found that if I push the volume all the way up, then mute and unmute, and turn up my headphones all the way, I can faintly hear the audio coming through.  If I touch the volume slider in the Sound system tray item after that, it's gone again.  I've tried using Process Explorer to kill off processes one by one, but nothing restores it to functional except a reboot.  It's frustrating as all get out, and it's intermittent.  Some days, I'll start the machine and run it for hours until turning it off with no problem, and other times the audio is gone before I start the first app.  I wish I had a solution I could post here, but I wanted to comment so that if someone does (please, please, please), I'll be subscribed and can see the answer!  :-)</p><p>Hope you get it fixed, and if you do, please post something here!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have the same problem on fresh xpsp2 installation. after 1 day of uptime like half of my services shut down (WTF). One of them is Windows Audio. When i start it up, i have sound again. I think there must be something that messes up audio devices (afaik there are 2 - Default audio device and real soundcard (for example realtek 860...)), I use skype plugin for miranda, that might be it.  Winamp, mplayer and other programs, where u can select audio device work. On the other hand, audio from flash on web pages, sound form games and other applications which use default audio device don't work.</p></div>
