		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I made the very same mistake.</p><p>My only other gripe with the Charting components is the lack of any type of envelope graphing.  Like: I want to show if a value is within a set of constraints.  You see it a lot in performance displays and engineering circles.</p><p>Sure, maybe it's a little obscure, but for outlandish cost of the charting package I expect my wildest charting fantasies to be fulfilled.</p><p>Aaron</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't know that.  I use column charts as opposed to bar charts because I thought that I read that bar charts display data similar to horizontal bar charts in CF.</p><p>I would like to see more chart types (like gauges and tanks).  All of my applications are some type of performance measurement site and a number of people have asked for gauges and tanks.  The standard types are okay but you really need more in today's environment.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was looking for a fix for an unrelated flex chart issue when I found this entry. For all future explorers to this spot, this will solve the problem.</p><p>Just make the bar chart a stacked or 100% type graph and then make the second entry 0.</p></div>
