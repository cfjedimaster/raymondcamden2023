		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hope you can attend cf.Objective() - it was the best event last year for me in terms of learning new stuff. I'd be interested to read your experiences of cf.Objective() 2007 if you can make it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 for cf.objective. It is like frameworks, only it has more content and it is all fairly advanced. Last year there was almost nobody in the corridors as even the veterans could find something in each time slot they wanted to learn about.</p><p>I would say cf.objective is very similar to frameworks and definitely worth attending.</p></div>
