		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was a great presentation last nite, Ray.  Wednesday are normally bad for me to attend one of your presentations "live".  Running one that late (for those of us in Central Time) worked to my advantage this time.  Though it was rough to go to sleep afterward.  Too many thoughts of Spry usages running round in my head after it was over.</p></div>
