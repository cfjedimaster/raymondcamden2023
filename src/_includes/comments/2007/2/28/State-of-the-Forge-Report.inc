		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to see the site is taking off. I think its great to have a place like this for us CF folks because sourceforge was lacking as of late with all their issues and google code while not bad isn't focused in our niche area. my .02 anyhow.</p><p>My only -gripe-, and I use that very hesitantly, is sometimes I feel its cumbersome to browse... especially if you are looking for something thats middle of the pack. There is no one click to get it, you either have to browse a 10 page recordset or click to another page load to search. Its very minor and its just because I'm inexplicably more lazy than most probably but a quick search on the front page would be astounding for me personally. Maybe no one else cares though Now you have .04 :D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>congratulations on the site.</p><p>For suggestions, it would be nice to be able to sort the projects by author.  Sometimes I can't remember the name of the project but I know who wrote it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Scott P:</p><p>Your wish is my command. I added Name. I also made the search check the short description and author name. I also reduced the size of the AJAX payload. It went from like 200KB to 98KB, which is still high, but better than nothing.</p><p>@DK: Yeah, I know, we need a little search box on top. THat would make it a bit quicker.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't say this enough as both a consumer and an author of RIAForge products, you've done such a great job with this site.</p><p>And Canvas?  That would be an awesome addition to the whole offering.</p></div>
