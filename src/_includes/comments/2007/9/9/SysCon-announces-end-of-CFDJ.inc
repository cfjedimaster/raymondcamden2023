Sorry to yell, but I find that disgusting. These are the guys who were trying to help the magazine - for free - and you screw them over? Nice job, Sys-Con. Real professional.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd like to point out our dealings with them. We've had a CFDJ print subscription for longer than I've worked in my current location (currently 3yrs 5months). We've never received any notice that the print publications were ceasing, or now that they are folding. Theres been no word on refunding our costs, or where things stood.</p><p>To be honest, I echo Sean's sentiments about their website. The sys-con site in general smacks of all that is annoying about the web these days with video and audio being blasted at you with no initial recourse. I stopped browsing the sys con site a long time ago, and generally ignore links people post to it. I've seen others post similar feelings, only to be belittled by some of their staff.</p><p> The best part is I just loaded it up from the link in your post and it locked up my firefox. heh</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a long-time author in the CF community (I published my first article in CFDJ in 2000, back when writers were actually paid...) and member of the erstwhile Editorial Board, I can't say this really surprises me (though, as Ray mentioned, even we weren't informed of the pending decision).</p><p>I can honestly say that I've never been involved with as unprofessional an organization as Sys-con has been in recent years.  Though CFDJ had become more ads than content, they didn't pay authors, didn't listen to their (all volunteer) editorial board, and insisted on producing a sub-standard magazine and an actively offensive web site.</p><p>I can see a big benefit in the announcement, though (besides not having to worry about board issues, editorial image, professional image, etc.):  in recent months, the discussion has been about whether Silverlight will be a Flash killer.  With Sys-con firmly on its side, Silverlight doesn't stand a chance.</p><p>Now I'm off to see if Michael and Judith need any more writers for the Fusion Authority Quarterly Update.  FAQU, Sys-con!! (Sorry, couldn't resist.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>These clowns have been hounding me the past two months to re-up my subscription.  They wanted &gt; $100 for a "PDF, non-print version" of the magazine, because they were ending the print edition.  Who can't see that writing on the wall?  Now if they would only send me the magazines they still owed me from my last subscription...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>DK,</p><p> I just wanted to say thanks for the kind words and reading!</p><p> I actually resigned from the column a few months ago for reasons completely unrelated to sys-con.  As far as I know as I know my last article (a retrospective + Thank You to the readers) did not go to print yet.</p></div>
