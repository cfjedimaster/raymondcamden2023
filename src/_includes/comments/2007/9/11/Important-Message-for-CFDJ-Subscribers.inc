		<div class="comment_text"><p>Don't even bother communicating with Sys-Con. Just call up your credit card company and tell them you are not receiving something you paid for and to issue a charge-back. When you get your money back go do something fun to celebrate the demise of crappy Sys-Con.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>At my workplace, I've subscribed to CFDJ since the stone age. When I went to resubscribe some months ago and they told me it was going "digital only", I dropped the sub. Having a background in the printing trade, I pretty much read between the lines and knew they were probably running deep in the red. Not that CFDJ has had anything worthwile to read recently.</p><p>Yeah, I'm with you, Ray. Forget 'em and their lame 'digital' hand-off to Java whatever or Silverlight, or whatever new word their CEO read in the inflight mag yesterday.</p></div>
