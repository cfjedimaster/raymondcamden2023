		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have had about 10 routers in the past 8 years (Linksys, Netgear, Belkin and Buffalo). The on that I have been most satisfied with is the Buffalo Airstation. Buffalo routers have excellent features (like loopback if you are running a development server) and very nice configuration screens as well as easy setup.</p><p>Buffalo also has many other products like nice network storage etc. However, for my next router, I have been considering the new Airport Extreme from Apple. I have heard nothing but great reviews on it:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.apple.com%2F1-800-MY-APPLE%2FWebObjects%2FAppleStore.woa%2Fwa%2FRSLID%3Fmco%3DB962F795%26fnode%3Dhome%26nplm%3DMB053LL%2FA%3ACZK4zXWWJCdXGAdmbe-xnVxLwP0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=B962F795&amp;fnode=home&amp;nplm=MB053LL/A">http://store.apple.com/1-80...</a></p><p>It is a little pricier but you can do some cool things with that you cannot do with most routers. For one, it does support N and Mac as well as PC. It also has Gigabit ethernet, and a USB port for making your printer networkable, or making a network hard drive. You can even connect multiple printers and drives to it via a hub!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Kyle - I've got 2 issues with DraftN. First off - I have a first gen MBP. I don't believe they support N, I think that was the second gen. I could be wrong. Secondly - my wireless network goes through a powerline network. That network tops out at 85 Mbs. So anything faster than that wirelessly is a bit of a waste. I'm going to upgrade my powerline stuff in a few months to the v2 version of it (can't remember the spec name), which goes up to 125 mbs I believe.</p><p>@Emmet - I'll try.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Had/Having the same issue with my MBP and an actiontec router.  I have found that decreasing the packet fragmentation has greatly boosted my signal and the effectiveness with which my MBP has been able to connect.  Essentially what happens is that the larger your packets the more likely they are to collide and get dropped, and losing a 2000 byte packet is far more detrimental to your connection stability then losing a 256 byte packet.  This does introduce overhead but so long as your not planning on transfering huge files across the network with regularity you should be fine.</p><p>Also I would grab a copy of iStumbler so you can see all the 802.11 activity going on.  See if there is anyone out there broadcasting on the same channel as you.  I was able to go from about 30-40% signal strength to 80% by changing channels and decreasing the packet fragmentation.</p><p>Worked out quite well for me yesterday.  Also I have heard some complaints from friends that their MBPs have issues with WEP, but it sounds like you have been down that avenue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As far as routers go I absolutely, unequivocally love the Cisco 815W for home use. Its opened up my network speeds by about 20% from the Linksys I switched from. Its a bit headier than using a Linksys with the plug and go as you need to configure a cisco IOS, but imho its well worth it.</p><p>As far as your problem, I'd do what Scott said and check another hotspot quick. It sounds more like your network card than the router on first read.</p></div>

If you open it up you can see a little card with two tiny wires with what look like buttons attached to it. Check that these are firmly attached.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, if you are looking for the best bang for your buck, you gotta go with a Linksys WRT54G, and put some 3rd party firmware. You get a $500 router for $50 if you go with the &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dd-wrt.com%3AthcYmp9UjgHad4LK3zwOU_6jrY0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dd-wrt.com">http://www.dd-wrt.com</a>"&gt;DD-WRT firmware&lt;/a&gt; the trick is to get a model that has some juice to it. Check the &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWRT54G%3AwWs17x5nfKAgE13J6MZkE2aJiQc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a>"&gt;Linksys WRT54G Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and be sure to look at the serial number on the box before buying.</p><p>** If you have trouble after flashing most recommend you power cycle (and cross your fingers - hehe)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have a similar problem from time to time. From what I observe it sometimes appears that the microwave causes this when it is running or if my cell phone is close by. I have not fully diagnosed this yet, but it appears that one or both of these could be causing the problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is an actual problem with OSX.</p><p>You must go into the network setting for your airport card and  choose preferred networks.  Then remove them all.  Click APPLY.  The change "By Default, Join:" back to automatic and again click apply.  Then reboot the MBP and Voila fixed.</p><p>Just for reference it is usually caused when the MBP goes to sleep while connected to the WiFi network.  If you need it I can dig up the link to the Apple KB.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had tried that- it didn't help. And with the router now flashing and not responding at all - I'm thinking it truly did bite the bullet.</p><p>So - no blog posts from me at night now. Well, for a day. What is odd is that the ethernet ports still work. So I may move the crap out of the kitchen so I can work tonight.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wireless routers do die after a while.  I had a super cheap Linksys that I got for $20 on sale.  After a year or so, it would only work intermittently.  I tried to upgrade the firmware, and that killed it off entirely.  Got a slightly nicer Linksys, so far so good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is done. The only issue I had was trying to get it into router mode - not gateway mode. It kept complaining that I didn't have a cord in the WAN link, which is true. I found it in the manual settings though. One laptop is connected and I'll do my wife's tonight. The signal strength does seem pretty impressive.</p><p>Oh - and I have to get my Xbox connected as well. That is mission critical.</p></div>
