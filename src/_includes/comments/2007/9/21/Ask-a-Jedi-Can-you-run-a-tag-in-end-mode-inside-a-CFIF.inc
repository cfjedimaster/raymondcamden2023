		<div class="comment_text"><p>Out of interest, why would you do this?  Why should this work any more than closing another tag out of flow would, e.g. you wouldn't start a paragraph outside of a table and close it inside the table?  Since 2000 when I cleaned up my HTML practices, I've felt that tag-based languages should be structured according to XML guidelines, which means closing tags cleanly, and IMHO my code has been better for it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm against this.  It's not what a tag based syntax should be trying to accomplish.  It should (IMHO) be accomplished via some other means (ie a function or something).</p><p>But then again, whatever makes you more productive and delivers the end goal should not be ignored.</p></div>
