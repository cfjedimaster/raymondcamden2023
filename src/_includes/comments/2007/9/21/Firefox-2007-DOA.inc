		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I did have a massive kernel panic today that could have been caused by Firefox 2.0.0.7.  Well, to be fair, I haven't had any time to check the logs for the actual culprit, but, with Tiger, those don't happen very often.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I totally agree, and have had the same issues.  Firefox (at least on OSX) has been getting worse and worse over the past year, in my opinion.  I have multiple crashes every day, sometimes with JUST GOOGLE open, and no other tabs.  I have switched to Safari for my regular browsing, and use Firefox only for debugging, and the web developer toolbar, when I'm working with a site.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't had any problems on my MBP and I run Firefox 2.0.0.7 all day (with usually 30+ tabs open).</p><p>The one significant difference is that I don't have any plugins installed yet whilst I slowly migrate from Windows to Mac (my Windows has 30+ plugins on v2.0.0.7, and other than the memory leaks (30+ tabs open) I have no issues there either).</p><p>So, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that it may be a plugin or two thats causing your issues (this has been known to happen in the past for people in both Win and Mac.  Bad programming (for a plugin) can do bad things =\ ).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Raymond:</p><p>I suspect it's an add-on causing problems. One thing to keep in mind, simpling disabling a Firefox add-on does not necessarily mean it's not causing issues. If you have add-ons you're no longer using, completely remove them.</p><p>Also, just to test things out, try creating a new profile and see how Firefox is acting then. I suspect your problems will go away completely.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Same thing for me on Windows. FF1.x never died on me, ever. FF2 has done so since the first release, crashing regularly. The sad thing is that IE7 seems far more stable than FF2 - the only reason I still use FF2 is that it is faster (initial page load time can be a few seconds quicker than on IE). That, and FF tabs are far better than IE tabs.</p><p>--- Ben</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have made the swap to safari for "surfing" and left my flaky and bloated firefox for development (also due to firebug)..  I have found by not relying on firefox for most of my web activity it actually has become less of an issue.  Safari also seems to provide a faster and slicker web experience.  My only issue with safari 3 beta is the inability to  upload files in a web form which is just plain ridiculous.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Running FF2 since the latest download is now crashing every time, but mostly with Yahoo.  I like the features of FF but I am going back to Safari.  I wish someone from Mozilla would take an interest since it is obvious that there are some problems.  Maybe not everyone is having a problem but enough are.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well here is what I did and it seems to be working so far.  I had and old dmg file for an earlier version of FF2.0.0.3 and I replaced it with the 2.0.0.7 and now things are back to working.  Strange!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought I'd report in - since disabling Firebug globally, things have been much better. It's kind of obvious now - but still - I'm happy my FF isn't crashing anymore.</p></div>
