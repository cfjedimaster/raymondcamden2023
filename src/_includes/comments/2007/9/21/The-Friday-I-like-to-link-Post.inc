		<div class="comment_text"><p>That CFDocument bug nearly killed me...We had tested a site in CF8, were happy with the performance and compatibility, so we moved it live.</p><p>Then comes that user that pushes the limits and wouldn't you know it, all of that user's cfdocuments blew up.  Too many pages.  After spend half a day scrambling I talked with the guys at Adobe and to their credit a day later we had a beta hotfix that fixed it.</p><p>Just wanted to give Adobe some props for responding so quickly and resolving these issues.</p></div>
