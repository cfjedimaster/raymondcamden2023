		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray,</p><p>Glad to see you airing your frustrations on your blog! I think it’s a healthy attitude to take, everyone should complain more, and it makes us feel better in the end :-)</p><p>This whole situation does pose a few interesting ideas and questions though, one of my main beefs with AJAX all along has been the security possibilities, it’s probably one of the reasons I’ve been VERY slow on the uptake of anything AJAX related, I've never been a JS fan, I'm sure plenty of people have read over opinionated posts from me in the past on the subject.</p><p>I'd be interested to see some serious presentations on the security exploits of AJAX and the ways to tackle them, as generally we're all Server Side developers and we all know about protecting our user produced content against SQL Injection and XXS, but for some reason many developers seem to forget these principles when dealing with JS.</p><p>It's a shame that Brain Flove had to blog about the exploit, that was a little unfair, he should have contacted you directly, on the other hand, I do like the concept of use challenging one another’s application security a little, and it’s a responsibility we should all share. I know when working on development for my application, I'll always buzz the dev server version over to some trusted developer friends and ask them to try and break it, and then we can work on actively patching the problems.</p><p>As CF developers we have quite a blessing when it comes to security, things like queryparam and script protect make it VERY simpler of us to build secure applications, and with J2EE sessions being as they are, they’re also very safe, at least from your average attacker, however this simplicity also probably makes us complaisant and I suspect a large number of people don’t make as much effort to strive for security as they should do... me included!... security isn’t really one of those things that can be ‘patched’ as an afterthought, it needs to be at the core of our design from the get go.</p><p>Thanks Ray,</p><p>Rob</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I used to run a few large community sites and they spanned from when I was first writing my first Coldfusion application all the way to some of my more later works.  I have always found people tinkering and fiddling and trying to boost their stats and get the edge up... in the beginning no-one really notified me, i just noticed weird oddities in the data and stats and I looked at my code how I could prevent this from happening.</p><p>More recently when I wrote my own forum software, there been a slew of bugs, permission issues, and HTML hacks that caused different things to happen... sometimes people would send me a polite note, other times you have to rely on the community to point these out.  Even if it means said community member takes an inappropriate action.</p><p>One thing I've learned... if you put software out there on the net... people are going to "test" it to its full abilities or disabilities.</p><p>I view it as a challenge and not something to get mad about.  In fact it gives me something to do and ultimately makes me a better and more experience software developer.</p><p>Here's to "Trial by Fire!"</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Ben.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Maybe I'm not being clear. I do expect people to find/report security issues. As I said, I knew this was a potential security issue (showing content like that). My problem was with how people played with it. I am over it - but I just want to be sure folks know - if you find a security problem with my app - please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention.</p></div>
