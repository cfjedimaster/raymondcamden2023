		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Check your add/remove programs list to ensure no installations  completed. If you're good on that end, go into Program Files\Adobe\Creative Studio 3\ (or wherever your install directory resides) and dump any folders created during the botched installation. Dump your temp files and reboot. Then attempt the installation again. If you're still having problems you will need to clean up your registry a little in which case hit me up on email and I will send you a quick cleanup script that you can tweak for your botched CS3 installation.</p></div>

It must just have been a glitch, Ray - I've run Adobe installers and upgraders on both MS and Mac for years without a single issue (although ask me about their constantly annoying update reminders every time I open a PDF...GRRRR!!!).</p><p>/ejt</p></div>
