		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Don't get your hopes up about Michael Crichton's "Next".  I found it to have quite a bit information, but it seemed to bounce around too much (almost like he was trying to write 4 different short stories, but combined them into one book).  I lost track a couple times and had to skip back to figure out what happened.  I actually didn't think it was as good as his previous book (not that that was too great either).  Definitely a let down for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Gareth: One of the reasons I hated his last book was that it was so flat. I actually _appreciated_ the view that environmentalists may be wrong - and that there may be media bias for global warming. I don't agree - but the IDEA was very interesting. But that way he presented in the book was horrible. With the hollywood star who was so ... flat I guess and the repeated arguments.</p><p>It would have made a _great_ lecture. But as a fiction story it was a complete mess.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Next is much like the previous book where he obviously researched a topic and found a lot of interesting stuff....but couldn't figure out a good fictional story to convey his non-fiction information with his fiction readers. I actually think the story in Next is worse, but the information (about the gray areas of medical research) is probably better.</p><p>Personally, I like Timeline (book not the movie) the best as he had some information to share, but it didn't get in the way of the compelling story he constructed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm something of a Lovecraft fanatic, so I wanted to state that up front. But I think he's by far the most imaginative and entertaining horror writer ever. He wrote in the 20's about extradimensional god-beings (Cthulhu), originated the entire "aliens among us" genre with "The Whisperer In Darkness", and all sorts of other ideas that were way, way ahead of their time. Anyone who even remotely likes this type of fiction needs to check him out. I recommend "The Call of Cthulhu", "The Shadow Over Innsmouth", and "The Dunwich Horror" as starting points, but virtually everything he wrote during his sadly short life is brilliant. And the best part is, most of his stories are only 20-30 pages long so you can devour them in one sitting.</p><p>Ray, I do so wish the Abrams movie was about Cthulhu, but it doesn't appear to be, at least not directly. I've heard it's based on "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" (which could easily be seen as a derivative of many of Lovecraft's works). I've been dying for a good film version of a Lovecraft story, but so far, unfortunately, they've all been bad and/or mangled versions of his tales.</p><p>Coincidentally, the captcha I have to enter is "Ib", which is the name of a city of Lovecraft's "The Doom that Came to Sarnath"!</p><p>Yes, now you know why I said I am a Lovecraft fanatic. ;-p</p></div>
