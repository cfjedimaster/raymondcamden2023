		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, glad to hear your eye didn't burst. I've had the same problem a few times on flights. It's quite painful for those who haven't ever had the displeasure of experiencing it.</p><p>It never hurts on take off, only on descent. I've even had that problem when I didn't think I was sick.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If the pressure comes back in the next day or two I'd definitely get it looked at. I had some pressure, cotton in the ears feeling sinus thing going on for a bit. It turned into an ear infection in barely any time, and then caused a full on bout of tinnitus. horrible stuff :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>**** WARNING!!!! ****<br>Useless knowledge alert!</p><p>If your ears hurt from flying or if you get water in your ear from swimming or if you have an ear infection, you can instantly relieve it by using rubbing alcohol.</p><p>What you do is take a cotton ball or some tissue paper and douse it with rubbing alcohol. Next tilt your head so that ear that is bothering you is pointing to the sky. Then drop the alcohol into your ear until filled (usually about 10 - 15 drops will do). Leave in your ear for at least 30 - 60 seconds. Then tilt your the other way to drain.</p><p>I learned this a long time ago from my brother girlfriend sister who was a swimmer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Whenever I fly with a headcold, I always shoot up with Afrin. Most of the time it helps (3/4 times i've had to, I had no problems once I landed) but one time I actually ended up with an ear infection and needed antibiotics.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There are also some earplugs made specifically for flying to keep the pressure stabilized. I think I found mine at CVS or Target.</p></div>
