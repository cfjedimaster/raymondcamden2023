		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the compliments, and for the great suggestion. As I stated in our own forum (where a link to this was posted), sometimes one can get lost at the 50,000 foot level - it's nice to have spotters on the ground to keep things in check.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've got kinda the same issue here, the only problem is my application doesn't have a web based login, we authenticate via IIS, not sure whats it called, but it's an authentication mechanism similar to a .htaccess in apache... <br>So the question is, how would you handle redirecting on an expired session here...? Currently now I have a browser/tab close on an interval once a user is not authenticated...</p><p>any thoughts??</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm no IIS guy - but if I remember right:</p><p>When you don't authenticate right, that's an error. IIS lets you specify what file to run on error. So you could specify a custom page there.</p></div>
