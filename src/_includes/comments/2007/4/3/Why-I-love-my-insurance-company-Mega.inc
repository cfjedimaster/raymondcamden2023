		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dude, I swear, insurance is the most blatantly obvious fraud ever conceived by man.  Their whole job is to NOT provide the services you're paying for.  And, for the most part, if they don't, you're screwed 'cause it'd cost way too much to sue them and they'd probably win because of the fine print somewhere in the agreement you signed.</p><p>Insurance pisses me off.  It really does.  This is one of the major reasons why we need universal health care.  The other major reason is the people who don't have insurance to begin with.</p><p>We should all be able to go the doctor or to the hospital when we need to.  No one (anywhere) should have to worry that we can't afford to have our ailments treated. (Maybe I'm an idealist, but let's all be human for a minute here.)</p><p>Honestly?  I pay a fair amount for insurance.  I never recoup what it costs me in real medical bills (except when Liz had the kids).  (Not that I'd want to have that many medical bills, of course.)</p><p>Anyhow. I'd pay *more* to the government, if I knew that I and my family and everyone else in the US were going to get the medical treatments they need.</p><p>This insurance crap is a joke and needs to be thrown out the window.  It's not just health insurance either.  I'm sure you're familiar with all the mumbo-jumbo going on with Katrina too.  If you have your house insured your whole house should be insured.  Period.  No riders for fire.  No riders for floods.  No wind damage, etc.  And when a claim is filed you should get whatever you need to at least get out of the hole and start over.  You shouldn't either be flat out turned down.  You shouldn't just get a pittance.  You should get what you paid for.</p><p>Ok.  I need to work so I've got to end my rant.  Sorry Mega is being dishonorable.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray- I promise you that if this turns into Yet Another Universal Health Care Debate, this will be my only contribution...  :)</p><p>In my years of working as a developer for insurance companies, two things never changed.  1) Universal insurance (in ANY form) does not solve the problem of insurance companies trying to weasel out of paying for claims.  2) People who call for universal health insurance have never dealt with an insurance company who *knows* they have a lock on their market.  I have- it's not pretty.</p><p>That being said- Glad to hear you seem to have found a good one.  After going through a lot of auto insurance companies who seemed to have a corporate mission statement of "Grab mine and RUN", Geico is really working out well for us.</p></div>

Hope it gets sorted out for you and that over time you guys figure out how to take the health of the nation out of the grip of vultures.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I lived in Montreal, Canada for a couple of years not too long ago.  My wife was in graduate school and since neither of us are Canadian citizens -- we were not covered by Quebec's provincial health coverage.  The only option for us for was to get coverage through the university with Blue Cross of Quebec.  Get this now...  We paid just shy of $1k USD for the BOTH of us for the ENTIRE year.  We had no co-pay for visits, no co-pay for Rx (with 100% coverage) and even an upgrade to a semi-private room for hospital stays (which is great since there are some hospitals that still have wards there).  All in all, this was private insurance as well and even the Canadians we knew complained that we paid WAY too much for coverage.</p><p>There's two reason in my mind why they can keep premiums downs. 1) The government sets the rates for procedures and visits and 2) the government negotiates drug prices each year and sets the selling price.  (Another is that drug patent laws are different there - so there's competition with the generic makers.)</p><p>This leads to a couple of things.  Since there is equal access to doctors, "bad" doctors (which diagnose not so well, maybe grumpy, etc.) loose patients.  If you want to do well, you have to practice medicine well.  I'd say that the quality of service was better than in the states.  However I'm sure people will disagree with me.  Maybe I'm an idealist, but let's all be human here - doesn't everybody have a right to health?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I live in Canada and think the coverage here is less than ideal. When you have something more serious, you can wait for MONTHS for treatment. And I constantly hear horror stories first-hand from people. There are doctors who are available and willing to operate on people but can't because the government doesn't let them. So they're just twirling their thumbs while there's a line of 500 people waiting, just because the government wants to keep costs down. So while the public system seems like a good and noble idea, it becomes more evident every year that the system here is flawed and needs re-thinking.</p></div>

But, what I am saying is that we should have a system that (in a perfect world) provided quality access to everyone in an affordable manner.</p><p>In summary, this isn't an insurance or government issue, it's a human issue.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a physician, I can tell you that all health insurance companies are inherently evil.  Every penny I earn has to be extracted from them....worse than pulling teeth. Their overriding goal is to deny as many claims as possible, for any reason, legitimate or not. I am positive that they have quotas to fill.  Insurance companies exist to make money and for no other reason.  Payments made to hospital and doctors are actually characterized as "medical loss".</p><p>It drives me crazy when I see money wasted by these companies for advertising claiming how much more "touchy feely" they are than their competitors, or how they have the best doctors on their panels.  What a waste of health care dollars.</p><p>There is so much waste in the chaotic, bureaucratic mess created by our totally dysfunctional health care system.  There needs to be a single payer system which could be a private/govt hybrid or all government controlled. Believe it or not, it is much easier dealing with Medicare than with any of the health insurers.  It is really time for the US to have Medicare for all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>In my experience the only way to get the best service from an insurance company is to pay top dollar.  I had 100% insurance for a while and now I have 80%, and if I could afford it I would go back to 100% as fast as possible.  Right now I am basically working overtime so I can go back to 100%.  You should try 100% Raymond, it's pricey but it's well worth the cash.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have been a health insurance broker for over a decade and every day I hear more and more horror stories like the ones posted regarding insurance companies not paying claims or refusing to cover specific illnesses and physician's not getting reimbursed. Unfortunately, the reality is that insurance companies are driven by profits, not people. If the insurance company can find a legal reason not to pay for something, chances are they will find it, and you, the CONSUMER will suffer. However, very few reasons exist. The majority of the time the insured has no idea that they purchased a plan with a variety of exclusions or payment caps and because these caps or exclusions are in writing in the policy, the insured has no legal recourse because they signed the paperwork and accepted the policy oftentimes blindly trusting the agent. So the insurance company wins again.</p><p>We can all complain about insurance companies but they are a necessary evil. Very few of us in this day and age would consider going without health insurance. This being the case, how then can you protect yourself from insurance companies, and how will you really know if you are getting the best plan for the lowest price? I have read the comments about the 100% plans and I agree that they have a great appeal. However, I would not recommend working overtime and giving up time with your family just to be able to afford a plan with 100% coverage. Everyone wants to have affordable, quality health coverage, but in my experience, particularly dealing with the small business and self-employed market, very few people want to take the time to educate themselves about health insurance. This is one of the primary reasons that most people feel like they have been defrauded or "ripped-off."</p><p>As a broker, I make calls to business owners all the time. Time and time again, I ask the same "BASIC" questions regarding the health plan that they currently have in place and 100% of the time, no one can answer all the following questions.</p><p>1. What Insurance Company are you with and what is the name of your plan?<br>2. What is your deductible?<br>3. What is your coinsurance percentage?<br>4. What is your stop loss number? (This determines your maximum out of pocket expense per year). <br>5. What is the Lifetime maximum benefit the insurance company will pay out if you become seriously ill?  <br>6.)Are there any "per illness" limits on your plan? <br>7.)Did you really buy a legitimate major medical plan or did you instead purchase a schedule plan which only pays a certain amount and nothing more per procedure? (example: Mega Life &amp; Health &amp; Midwest National Life a.k.a. N.A.S.E.<br>8. Does your plan offer any outpatient doctor copays and how much are they? If you have them are they limited?<br>9. Does your plan offer outpatient prescription drug coverage and if it does, do you pay a copay or do you have to meet a separate drug deductible before you receive any benefits?<br>8. Does your plan have a reduction in benefits for organ transplants? <br>9. Do you have to pay any separate deductibles on your plan if you need hospitalization or emergency room services?<br>10. Are there any restrictions/limits on out-patient services, such as, physical therapy, speech therapy, etc. or are there separate "access" fees for these services?</p><p>If you can't answer all ten questions either, does that mean you are not a smart consumer? No! It just means that you have a "bad" agent. A great agent will really take the time to help you understand your health insurance benefits. A great agent looks out for YOUR best interest and NOT the interest of the insurance company.</p><p>So how do you know if you have a "great" agent? If you can answer all of the above questions without looking at your policy, you have a "great" agent. If you can't you don't.  Just like any other profession, there are professionals that really care about the clients they work with and there are others who will never return phone calls when you have a question or a problem.</p><p>Considering that Health Insurance is one of the most important "buying" decisions that we are likely to make, why do most of us know so little about what we purchased?</p><p>Unlike car buying, where you assume that an engine, transmission and air-conditioner is standard, health insurance is a maze of confusion where "nothing" may be standard. When purchasing health insurance, the "transmission" may be an option. If you have every option you can think of (100% Coverage) but are relatively healthy and rarely go to the doctor, is it worth giving the insurance company an extra $200 per month or is it better to save that money, just in case you have to pay out of pocket? Remember, there is no bonus or refund of premiums for staying healthy....but is it really in your best interest to have to work overtime to afford your health plan?</p><p>To be an informed consumer, you have to ask a lot of questions and feel comfortable with the answers that you receive. Read the fine print in your health plan brochure and make sure you find out what every asterisk next to the benefit description really means. Do an internet search for lawsuits against that company. If the original poster would have researched MEGA Life and Health, aka Midwest National Life a.k.a. National Association for the Self Employed (N.A.S.E) a.k.a. Alliance for affordable services (all U.I.C.I. companies)he would have noticed the 14 class action lawsuits brought against them since 1995. In turn, he probably would not have bought a policy from them in the first place.</p><p>If you have concerns about an insurance company, in regards to complaints or non-payment of claims, call your state's Department of Insurance and find out how many complaints have been made against the insurance carrier by other policy holders. If you think your agent is trying to rip you off or you are concerned about insurance fraud, ask the Department of Insurance if there have been any complaints made against that agent.</p><p>There are a lot of things you can do become an educated consumer and make good solid buying decisions. And always remember....."if it sounds too could to be true, it probably is!"</p><p>-C.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mr. Camden,</p><p>I sincerely hope you have better luck than my current client has with MEGA.  Sure the premiums are low but the benefit limits are questionable and the contracts they have with providers leaves the patient with some large balances due.  For example, room and boar 100% up to $600 per day on the schedule of benefits.  The hospital contract allows for only a 4.5% discount.  If your bill is $10,000, you get a $450 dollar discount and the balance due is over $9,000.</p><p>You might want to rethink that policy endorsement....</p></div>
