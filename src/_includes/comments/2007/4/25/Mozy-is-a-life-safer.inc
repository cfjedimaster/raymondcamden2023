		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use the unlimited Mozy in my home / office, and at the office of my biggest client, persuaded the business manager to install the "business" version on about a half-dozen machines. It's so EASY, set-it forget-it... until you need the backups! You even get a crude variety of versioning going back 30 days or so if you have a changing file saved with a given name multiple times over that span.</p><p>What I WON'T forget is the wonderful feeling the one and only time I had to turn to a Mozy backup to rescue myself. Five bucks a month? No cost at all for the value of the service.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For the question about security:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmozy.com%2Fsupport%2Ffaq%3AOQ7bk4tIIWjxz2juzx3tCOCBTkg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mozy.com/support/faq">http://mozy.com/support/faq</a></p><p>Is Mozy secure?<br>Yes. When you use Mozy, your files are encrypted on your PC using 448-bit Blowfish encryption and then transferred the Mozy servers using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. You have the option of using a Mozy key, or your own private key to encrypt your data. Note, that if you use your own private key, you must be very careful about not losing it, because if you do, we won't be able to help. It's impossible for us to decrypt your data when you use your own key. Most users opt to use the Mozy key, but it's up to you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim, in that case Id probably recommend investing in a Blue-Ray burner in the near future and do a once a month archive to Blue Ray DVD. A couple 25GB DVDs should cover most of anyone's critical data I'd think and still be cheaper (over time) and more secure than online backups. Personally, I've only used online backup services for Enterprise level data, where I know the data is encrypted and I control the encryption keys. Too much scary stuff happening these days.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think people should definitely take a look at Carbonite. It also provides online hard drive backup. The deal they have is great, 50 dollars for unlimited backup. I havent had any problems either. Some other services allow you to back up smaller amounts of space which I dont like, because then I have to pick and choose what to keep secure and what to leave vulnerable. Carbonite allows me to backup everything. I give it my highest recommendation.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be fair - Mozy has a paid option as well. (I use it.) I don't remember the price but it was pretty darn close to 50 as well. So if you don't want to pick and choose, then you can backup everything with Mozy as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm currently a Mozy user, it's pretty good, you get what you pay for. From my readings the more expensive services can do backups much quicker, and support unlimited versioning.
