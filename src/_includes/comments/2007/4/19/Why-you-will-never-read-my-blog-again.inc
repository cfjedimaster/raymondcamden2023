		<div class="comment_text"><p>It seems that this line:<br>&lt;CFSET DOUBLE_NEWLINE = NEWLINE &amp; NEWLINE&gt;<br>...provides a savings of 3 characters per use. However, you only used it one time, so if you actually used more characters by using the CFSET. But creating the double_newline for the replace method was much easier to read overall, so maybe that's ok. It just struck me as funny that there is no apparent way to shorten "DOUBLE_NEWLINE" without losing readability.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>God, that is hard on the eyes. I was still writing uppercase code up until sometime in 2006, when Ray mentioned case in one of his posts. So, I decided to get with the times. I remember how hard it was to force myself to write in lowercase.  Thanks for kicking me into modernity!</p></div>
