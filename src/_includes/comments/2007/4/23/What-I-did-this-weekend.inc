		<div class="comment_text"><p>My nephew got one for Christmas just like that, me and my brother in law spent 3 hours putting it together that night. Needless to saw we got to admire it for 15 min before the kids took it apart. Than they asked us to put it back together, of course we said no but it was nice to see it built. I'm trying to find the Death Star!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's great, quite an accomplishment. I started on one of those destroyer droids you have in the background with my 5 yr old and it was going well until he tried to do some of the work himself and lost some of the pieces. I've been afraid to try it since. Maybe we can get away with ignoring any missing bits.</p></div>

I'm sure plenty of contractors do that - right?"</p><p>Isn't that what happened with the original Death Star? The contractor forgot the obstacles in the vent ports?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice Ray!</p><p>My wife and I take our 5 year old to Downtown Disney (Orlando) about once a week and one of his favorite places to go is the Lego store. That place is incredible. He will sit outside at the build stations and build stuff for hours if you let him!</p><p>I make a point every trip to let him pick out a lego project for us to build together. Our last couple were from the Exo-squad line, they are pretty neat. We have already built every Bionicle piece they have so its on to other things.</p><p>I tried to talk him into the AT-ST model but he said if he couldnt play with it, he didnt want it!</p><p>That place has a T-Rex out front that is about 12 or 14 feet tall along with a transformer style robot about the same height. They are awesome. I will post some pics on my site of them shortly for you guys to check out.</p><p>Go ahead and pre-order the Falcon! You know you want it!!</p></div>
