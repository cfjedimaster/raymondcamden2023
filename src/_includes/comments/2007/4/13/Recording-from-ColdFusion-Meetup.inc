		<div class="comment_text"><p>No, Dave. Like Robert, I can view it in FF 2.0.0.3 (running on Windows XP). In fact, I tested that before I posted the URL recording. I've not heard of any other such issues yet. Curious.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lola, meetings (if any) will always be posted on the meetup site (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoldfusion.meetup.com%2F17%2F%29%3AaQi751wTXJzOUK-YJm2DGmf0mqk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/)">http://coldfusion.meetup.co...</a>. Now, you may have checked and not seen one, because we had not scheduled one immediately, but there's one there now, set for 2 weeks out, Thursday Apr 26.</p><p>Also, if you're a member of the meetup group, you'll get notification of new meetings. That would be more expedient than asking in Ray's comments. :-) He may not always know the latest scoop.</p><p>Indeed, I just arranged the next speaker this morning and he may not yet even know about it. That's the beauty of co-leading. Each of us can take responsibility and neither one has to handle all the load. :-)</p></div>
