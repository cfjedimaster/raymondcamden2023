		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for posting the recording of the Spry presentation. I had not looked at Spry before (boy do I feel stupid now!). Anyway you made it look easy and after hearing that Spry was already in BlogCFC -- I felt inspired to Spry-ify my new BlogCFC instance with a tabpanel widget. So I did.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice. BlogCFC uses Spry for the related entries code. I don't think I'm using it for the tabs yet though. I need to update that and be 100% Spry.</p></div>
