		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the subject of IE6/7: while I was at An Event Apart Boston last week, I heard several of the speakers mention an amazing script from Dean Edwards called IE7. When called in pages of your site, his script fixes a huge amount of IE's bugs and quirks, and improves IE6's support for many CSS features and transparent PNGs. Jeffrey Zeldman, Eric Meyers, and Cameron Moll all mentioned it, saying that it practically turned IE6 into IE7. Imagine using one script on your site and you no longer have to code or test for IE6's quirks!</p><p>a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdean.edwards.name%2FIE7%3AG4F-H_KHAwrlyWxO6eJGTC6mVsk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7">http://dean.edwards.name/IE7</a>"&gt;<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdean.edwards.name%2FIE7%3C%2Fa%3E%3AtVkQVy8YBrGKaWmfx0PqX8CNE4c&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7</a>">http://dean.edwards.name/IE...</a></p></div>
