		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dude - I always HATE missing one of your preso's...  but the timing (Wednesday Evenings - Central Time) kills me.  Luckily you record yours.  I am on a billiards league and the team is in first place with a good shot at Nationals Tournament in Vegas this year.  So they kinda count on my participation (and the venue we are playing at tonight has no wifi hotspot).  Our home venue HAS a wifi hotspot and normally I get to attend while waiting for my turn to shoot (yes - I write code between pool games in a pool hall - I know - I'm a geek).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks again for that presentation. It's amazing how I've checked out pretty much every Ajax framework out there and missed out on Spry... I hope I can make some time to play with it. Btw, really do make sure you look into selector functionality for javascript, it's really become indispensible nowadays for manipulating the DOM. And the good part is that they're painfully easy to use. If you know basic CSS syntax, you can use these things, and it's the same for all frameworks, other than the fact that they each have their own method names.</p></div>
