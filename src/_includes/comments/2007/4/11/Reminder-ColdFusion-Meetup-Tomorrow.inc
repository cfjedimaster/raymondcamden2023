		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. THis is NOT the end of the CFJUG. The CFJUG is very different from the Meetup. The CFJUG is just me, whereas Meetup is multiple speakers. The CFJUG is a class (mainly) for beginners, while Meetup is for a variety of development levels.</p></div>
