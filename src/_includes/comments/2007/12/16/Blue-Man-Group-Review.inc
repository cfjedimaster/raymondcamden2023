		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Blue Man Group has a place in Chicago where they perform, and my wife bought us tickets for our anniversary a couple years ago. I share similar sentiments: It totally pulled out the kid in me and I had a blast.</p><p>The rolls and rolls of toilet paper with a heavy techno music backdrop was an awesome finale to the night.. :-D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The permanent shows in Las Vegas, Boston, Chicago, and New York (and other places in the world) are theatrical shows with concert elements, while BMG's Rock Tours are concerts with theatrical elements.</p><p>It's too bad they couldn't make this clearer to people before they bought tickets, as I'm sure many people wanted to see a show rather than a concert.  Glad you still enjoyed it, though.</p><p>-A BMG fan</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw them the Friday night after MAX last year. Seeing one of their shows was on my "to do" list while in Vegas, so having them show up for the keynote was a big bonus. I got one of only 5 tickets left Friday morning and ended up in the 6th row. One row past where they gave out the raincoats.</p><p>Had a blast. I'll see them again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I rented the DVD of their tour and I was blown away.  Went right out and bought a bunch of their music.  They've come to town, but I've been too cheap to buy tickets.  I'm waiting to see the entire deal in Vegas.  Completely unique, great music.</p><p>How do you like Mass Effect?  I've got it coming in the mail.  I'm not a RPG guy, but think it looks interesting.  gamertag: matthewsteiner</p></div>
