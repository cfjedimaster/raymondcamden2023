		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually avoided mass effect because half the reviews I saw said something to the effect of the combat system is buggy to the point of wanting to bash your controller into the wall but then the overall review was something like a 8.9 or 9 lol !?!?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>good review.</p><p>one thing, if you want to take the crappy filter off go into options and turn off the 70's filter.</p><p>I think the soundtrack is amazing, very Thing-ish at times.</p><p>My biggest complaint is driving the MAKO around worst control scheme for a vehicle.</p><p>I really love the storyline, modern choose your own adventure!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ben - Well, yeah, it is odd, but seriously - despite the flaws, the game is amazing.</p><p>@DK - Odd. I find combat a bit fun. As I said, the control scheme is hard - but I wouldn't say combat is buggy.</p><p>@Justin - I need to ry that. I noticed there were some settings for graphical stuff. I find that a bit odd though as most games don't ask you to tweak stuff.</p><p>Oh - and thew MAKO. Another fun bug. If you flip the MAKO, you are screwed. You can't exit the MAKO then - and there is no flip command.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great review Ray. I rented Mass Effect a couple of weeks ago, and really enjoyed it. I have to agree with the whole MAKO issue. Why does it have to be so hard to control :P?</p><p>But I really enjoy the combat system, much more than in KOTOR. At least now I have the feeling that I'm doing something, rather than clicking a button and hoping my character doesn't miss.</p><p>I haven't had any graphical issues though (no popping or slowdowns). Have you checked your disc for scratches? Does it happen with any other games? HTH ;).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jason, I remember via muscle memory, and I don't have my controller nearby - but it was - if I remember right - right trigger (for sure) and the left button in the 4 grid on the right. I think that's X.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is my 2 hours in review.</p><p>Personally, I hated GRAW because of the overly complicated controls. I hate squad-based fighting to the core. If you make a squad, please don't recruit them from the short bus. I can't tell you how many times I've shotgunned a comrade to the back of the head or watched my sniper charge into a room and shove the flashbang I just set up his bum.</p><p>Mass Effect, Quality Squad. So happy. I disagree with all of the reviews I've read. They claim you are "thrown into a confusing mix" right away. I disagree. I killed maybe 10 guys total on the first planet (Edin Prime). How is that "in the mix". Maybe COD4 has reset my bar for "the mix". Meh.</p><p>Anyway, I do dislike the crazy amount of equipment I have. Like I said, I just cleared Eden Prime and I have 20 guns in my inventory and 7 armor options. That is nutz. Especially when I don't want to give my squad any equipment. Wanna know why?</p><p>----------Spoiler --------------------<br>You lose a squad member in the first 20 minutes, are you effing kidding me? C'mon. Now they've set the tone that at any moment you could just lose someone...and if all you equipment is on them...gone!</p><p>Lame<br>----------Spoiler --------------------</p><p>But, for a 2 hour review....7/10.  I got caught in a loop in the conversation system. That pretty much annoyed the hell out of me. They changed the text for the conversation path, but it was the same path. Booooo.</p><p>More to come.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not a role playing guy AT ALL, will I hate this game?  My neighbor has it and I played it a little more and it seemed alright.  I think it's more of an "action RPG?" not the old school (hit the guy with 15 points worth) text based type role players.  GOW, COD4, Halo 3, Rainbow Six Vegas are the best shooters with Rainbow Six in the lead.  They all have their advantages and true Rainbow Six is a thinking man's shooter, but you can't beat having all that control.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Matthew - I think the Bioware RPGs, in general, are much more approachable to "non-RPGers". I think you should try it. At worse - get Knights of the Old Republic on the cheap shelf. If you don't like it - you will know.</p></div>
