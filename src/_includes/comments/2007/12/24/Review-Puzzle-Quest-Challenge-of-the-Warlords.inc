		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agree, after being through 3 Xbox 360's (RRoD), I still find myself playing XBLA games.  Puzzle Quest is great and just yesterday I downloaded a classic, Tempest.  I played that as much as the Call of Duty 4(PS3) that was under my tree.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My buddy had downloaded this on his Xbox and completely addicted my girlfriend.  Same with Settlers of Catan.  PQ is available on most of the consoles and easy enough to find, but the PC version is impossible to get ahold of.  The PC version has most of its files in XML so people have been modding the game like crazy, creating thier own classes.  Love this game.</p></div>
