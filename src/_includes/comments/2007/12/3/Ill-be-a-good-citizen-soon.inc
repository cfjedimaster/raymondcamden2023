		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had jury duty a few years ago. I loved it.</p><p>Imagine a world where no one is competing with one another. A place where everyone comes together from different walks of life, regardless of their income or social class. Picture a land where there is no reason to be the group leader or a minion in the system. There's a social dynamic between jurors that is one of the coolest things I've witnessed in my lifetime. The entertainment begins during the in-person juror selection, when people show up with notes from their boss/doctor/mother describing why their employee/patient/offspring can't attend jury duty.</p><p>You'll love it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A year ago I received a summons for Federal Jury duty for a two month period starting in August 2007.  This past summer I got a letter stating I was on-call for October and November and that I would receive a Notice to Report in the mail if I was called up.  I didn't receive a single thing so other than the fun form and the letters -- I never got to "experience" the jury.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Once in a while I get a jury duty notice.  And without fail I put down that I will need a sign-language interpreter.  To date, I'e never been called for jury duty. Go figure.  Budget for hiring interpreters is not infinite, and it can be very expensive to hire certified interpreters.</p><p>And if one goes with a non-certified interpreter, trust me, there will be screw-ups.  Especially since such interpreters usually have not gone through training for interpreting in a legal environment.</p></div>
