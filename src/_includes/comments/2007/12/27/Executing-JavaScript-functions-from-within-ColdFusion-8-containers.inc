		<div class="comment_text"><p>Spry is a bit more than one JS function, so I'd be surprised if it worked. I'd also be curious as to _why_ you would use it? I use Spry to load data via AJAX which lets my page appear to load quicker. If I'm using an Ajax based container then using Spry seems redundant to me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I decided to go back and re investigate this issue  a bit further. Firebug shows that spy validation libraries are loaded as well as the special spry CSS styles. The hidden spans are hidden as they supposed to.</p><p>If I place the alert code before or after the widget code as Ray suggested in another thread, it works and alert is fired.</p><p>The spry validation, however still does not work. Even if I set it to validate on blur and change.</p><p>The same exact code works with spry HTML panel</p><p>I will keep you posted if I find anything further.</p></div>
