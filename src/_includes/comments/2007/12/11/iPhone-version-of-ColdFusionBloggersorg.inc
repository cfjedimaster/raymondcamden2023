		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ Ray,  you may want to make your mobile page even "lighter".  How much of the YUI do you really need.  Tooltips are pretty cool but at what cost?</p><p>I know CFBloggers was made to highlight CF8 and all of it's ajax goodness so this comment maybe out of line, but those of us who hate to see the data section of a wireless bill... it would help to stop panic attacks, or a least limit their duration!</p></div>

The Apple iPhone is a fantastic device I think, even SAP apparently announced it would port some applications to it as it "is so easy to integrate into corporate environments".</p></div>

Couldn't find an emulator to try the script out. Maybe there's no such thing. Does anyone know if there is? Had to contact the client to get him to try it out, and I don't like having to do things like that. Just doesn't make me feel very professional</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chris, I'd definitely say that if you are a "serious" about mobile development then you at least need one device. I won't say you need DW - but it is freaking amazing how much it helps. But at minimum you want at least one piece of hardware. I've currently got 3 tablets and a few phones, but I only test on my main phone. My wife has an iPhone I could use in a pinch, but eventually I probably need to pick up a iPod Touch and an iPad.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray is right - you'll need at least one hardware device, as current as at least one year before today's date, in order to be able to test the mobile version of your site/app.  I'm working on a website and we're planning on having a mobile version, so we'll eventually need to update our smartphones, maybe even get a tablet. My BB8830 just ain't gonna cut it anymore, I'm afraid.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Luckily I bought the Web Premium Creative Suite a couple of years ago, but being partially disabled and working from home, money is tight, so I have to put up with my aged Motorola RAZR V3X, aging Creative Suite 4, and still can't justify the expense of ColdFusion Builder, although I would love to get a copy (actually, I have just downloaded the latest version, so I can at least use the free Express Edition after the trial).
