		<div class="comment_text"><p>Robin, I have never seen a cock fight. I haven't seen dog fights either. That doesn't mean I don't know that they are disgusting. Cocks don't just fight "naturally", they are angered and encouraged to fight. They are given weapons. How is that natural?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would think there are more important issues in the world than banning cockfighting. Cockfighting, to many who participate is a near spiritual experience. That blood sacrifice is part of the tradition. Why couldnt people spend more time and money, say trying to cure AIDS?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's great that one state is leading cockfighting. Roosters are natural-born fighters, with or without gaffs. Even, if you put gloves on them, they're gonna fight. so what would if i had electronic gloves that would mark the hit; instead of piercing the birds, would that make it better????? or would the gambling become an issue?? I was under the impression that we lived in a free country.. Animal activist should find a way to claim all the animals in the world and allow us to claim them on our income tax to support the animals in the world. Activist do more for the freaking animals than a human-being without food or shelter, why not worry about our hungry and homeless, and let something that has been going on for centuries alone. You go, Louisana!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well I believe that cock fights will continue to happen regardless of what people say. So why not allow them in a control environment. In Puerto Rico the animal are treated like kings and train to do what they do naturally, those who say that cocks will not fight naturally need to go watch them in a natural environment and not in a zoo where they are keep separately. In Puerto Rico the clubs were they fight are overseen by two judges which make sure that all ruling are upheld, for example a cock can not fight for more then 14 minutes an during that time if the bird doesn't fight or engage for 60 seconds the bird is declare a loser. I think there is bigger problems in our country then to take the right to fight cocks from a large number of people, why not put some of our effort in eliminating and making lobbying in congress illegal that to me is a crime where people that have unlimited financial power could change the system to there benefit and slaughter us financially. Like corporations that take away our pension benefits and pays the CEO 12 million in bonus. How about the chicken industry where a bird is hatched and raised in a cage for 6 weeks with out know what it feels to run in the field and shot with growth hormones to make sure it yields 4 pound in that period of time, to make the greedy corporation millions, why isn’t that illegal. Please let’s not be hypocrites and allow our constitutional rights let our founding fathers rest in peace and stop challenging what our great nation was founded on the right to be free to exercise the freedom of speech and the pursuit of happiness, don’t ask us to stop being AMERICAN.</p></div>
