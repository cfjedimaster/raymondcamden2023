		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be fair to Steve, we all hyped this thing up by all the debate over XML config v. API conventions and Steve was led like a lamb to the slaughter. He was quite willing to be thrown into the lion's den however, but he made some concessions from the very beginning about it only being an experiment.</p></div>

As one scouting for an alternative to FB3 and learning and being coupled to one of the XML-based frameworks, I liked its simplicity.</p><p>Ray, thanks for your helpful presentation on Model-Glue.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This approach feels like Rails, and I don't like their idea of having object names and methods in the URL - too easy for someone to change.<br>I've not looked too much at the code yet, but it seems the Application scope would very easily end up just as a mess of CFCs.</p><p>"Steve made the point that the whole var scope thing was an Adobe bug"<br>That's not what Macromedia told me during the (CF7) beta. Thay said it was a feature, and more over some people are relying on the behaviour and so it wasn't going to be fixed.<br>I'm hopeful it'll be an option in CF8, along a with one to ban output from CFCs without having to write output="false" on them all.<br>Failing that, I'm going to hunt down the people using the broken variable leaking stuff in their code and talk at them till they stop :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't see this presentation, but from how you've explained it, it sounds like Steve is teaching a methodology not a framework. Were there core files in the framework? Or was it primarily a set of rules? I consider that to be the main difference between the two.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, can you send me a link to your var scoping tool you made a while back? I still think it would be relatively easy to extend it to handle included templates. Don't you? I'll add the functionality to it if you're up for it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rachel, the methodology that Steve was discussing makes me recall the FB2 era.  FB2 was no framework but a methodology/concept.</p><p>Though FB2 doesn't have any core file, but it was much powerful than some other frameworks which has a complete set of core files.</p><p>The idea that Steve brings out this time really give me a glance.  When I read his idea in a blog, I said "Wow, why didn't I think of that?".</p><p>The FB4 feature which means most to me is the &lt;do /&gt; syntax.  It's really usefully, especially to architect the application with MVC approach.</p><p>As all of you might know, &lt;do /&gt; is for invoking another fuseaction within a fuseaction.  Before FB4, FB3 did the similar job by FuseQ.</p><p>Before Steve's idea comes out, I just thought the &lt;do /&gt; feature could not be done well without XML config &amp; parse.  Therefore, I felt comfortable to rely on the FB4 core files as long as I can enjoy this feature.  But, when Steve points out the CFC way, I thought we were re-inventing the wheel in some senses.</p><p>For FB5, the new features: lexicon and fuseaction-wide variable scope (there might be some other) can be accomplish by Steve's idea without any extra effort.  For example, when using &lt;cffunction&gt; tag, we can use whatever cf-tags we want.  But when using &lt;do&gt;, we have to pre-define lexicon.</p><p>"If we can do it as good in pure CF, why do we need the core files?".  That's my curious.</p></div>
