		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Thanks for the presentation last night - it was definitely informative. I think I had the only question afterward...</p><p>Have you seen a noticable difference in performance on the server between Alagad and CFImage while doing image conversions? In my particular case, I'm resizing a lot of images that are a meg or more down to around 10K.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Steve - Checking into it.</p><p>@Kris - I have not done any speed comparisons. I do know that CF8 offers you options when it comes to performance, as you saw when I played with the rotation code. CF8 errs on the side of speed, but gives you the option for slower, more prettier results. I think that's a good choice.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Thanks for the video-cast thing. Saved me about 4 hours of reading to get me up and running with the fancy new cfimage functions.</p><p>1 thing though (not sure if you can do it while recording your presentation) it would be great if you could zoom your screen in when trying to show off some of the details or the text in the error messages you got. On the Mac, all you have to do is hold COMMAND-OPTION then use the "-" and "=" buttons to zoom in to your pointer.</p><p>Thanks again. Great work as always.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ah yeah - I love that zoom thing - but I always tend to forget the key command. I'm not so sure ow useful it would be over connect. The code wasn't big enough as is.</p></div>
