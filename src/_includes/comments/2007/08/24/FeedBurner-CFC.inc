		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just did a Google search for "coldfusion feedburner," and it never fails that you show up on these kinds of searches, Ray. :)</p><p>I'm looking into building some really killer dashboards and apps for a marketing system, and I could see this being immensely useful. I'm getting tired of logging into different systems to get to my data, so I'm appreciative of finding this CFC as a first step in some major integration!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's ridiculous that few business use these great APIs to get to the data that really matters. I would say that CF developers seem to be behind in this, but then I realize that it's not unique to CF.</p><p>Again, your curiosity and willingness to tinker is much appreciated!</p></div>
