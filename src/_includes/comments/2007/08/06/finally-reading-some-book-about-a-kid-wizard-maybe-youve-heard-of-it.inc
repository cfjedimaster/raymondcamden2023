		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, the books grow up with the kids, become increasingly darker. I personally really liked the progression. Book 6 and 7 are really just fantastic. I think one reason they are so good is that they incorporate both the fantasy world full of cute words and terms and silliness (ie. children' story element) and extremely rich characters and the narrative depth of serious literature.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>IMHO the movies have been like a slideshow to the book, and I can't understand how people who never read the books would get a lot of it... especially in the latest movie oferring. They gloss over, change, and forego so much backstory and in some cases change it all for time constraints. One of the big ones is quidditch. It has such a profound effect and influence on the protagonist and the past 2-3 movies have completely ignored it and changed the story around ignoring it. Seems kind of weird.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't start reading the books until the 4th one had been released....  There is something about the books that really keeps me going. I mean , for me, they are very hard to put down once I get started. I tell myself I'm going to quit for the night after this chapter then end up going on and on...</p><p>I think you will enjoy them... And if you like to listen to books, these are great for that.. I've always been a little disappointed with the movies as compared to the books. I kind-of feel like they should be considered "an arrangement" (to borrow a musical term) rather than "the story"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@DK:</p><p>Granted, but I often wish that screen adaptations were developed with less of an eye toward the original book and more toward a cohesive story.  I just don't think it is possible or advisable to try to turn even a 300-page book into a 2-3 hour movie and do it justice.</p><p>I *just* saw the fourth movie, and was very disappointed with how disjointed the narrative was.  I haven't read the books (beyond the first), and I agree with you that I don't get a lot out of the films.  But I could have--had the screen writers and directors made a firm decision in the beginning to make a story -based- on the characters and plot of the book.</p><p>I suppose that's a tricky question when artistic egos are on the line, and the purists are an important part of your audience....</p><p>/ejt</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another big fan here.  My wife and I read all of the books out loud together so that we'd get to share the enjoyment - it was a great experience to do that.  We really love the books and wish they'd put more effort into retaining more of the books' details in the movies - I think the fans would have been just fine with 3+ hour movies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok I just want to through my thoughts into this one since I just finished books 6 and 7. While I must admit I didn't read them myself I listened to the audio books as read by Jim Dale. If you have not heard him read a Harry Potter book I suggest you try it out. I know an audio book is not reading but when working in the basement it's great to hear it as I work. Jim Dale holds the worlds record for voices and if your imagination is any good it's like watching the book blind. Thats the best way I can describe it.</p><p>Also his voices sound alot like the voices in the movie (most anyway) so it's really easy to follow the story.</p><p>I only sold out to audio books because I work so much I don't have time to sit down and read a book.</p></div>

What do folks want? Five hour movies?</p><p>The last few books I've read as they came out, putting my life on hold for 24 hours and doing nothing but reading (and eating and a little sleeping :) They're great books.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@ Sean - Well.... 5 hour movies would be a bit much... But, longer movies are not unheard of.. You know, when you read something that entertains you, you get a strong mental impression on what's going on visually.. And when it is translated into film and the "actual" visual differs from your own... well... You tend to notice the discrepancies between the two mediums even more.</p><p>@Rob - Nope, not broken... I have several friends who feel the same way you do.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What took you so long?  ;-)  Yes, the books get darker and darker, but it's for a "good" reason, to advance the plot further.  And there are a lot of allegories to discover, if you know  you literature and history well.  The series is good because there's so many levels to read at - for simple pleasure, to see how the characters develop and grow, to see what the author has drawn on from her literature and history knowledge.  I would put her on the same level as C.S. Lewis and Tolkien.  There aren't too many authors nowdays who can write that way, unfortunately.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Rob -- If you're broken...that makes two of us.</p><p>First of all, I'm thrilled that someone was able to write a series of books that got many children and adults alike, who aren't "readers" to read.</p><p>Second, I think Rowling is a very imaginitive person with a very accessible writing style.</p><p>My issue with these stories that has kept me from getting into them (and I AM a reader) is that the stories just don't resolve very well.  I will admit that I only ready through book 3 and saw a couple of the movies, but it always seemed like the turning point and resolution of the story (or climax and deneoument for you literary buffs) were totally random and made no sense (e.g., resurrected bird and flying car).  I guess I just like a story that when it all unravels, I can look back and say "I totally should have seen that coming because of the subtle foreshadowing and clues".  It didn't seem like HP had any of that.  It was always just dumb luck that got this naive, disobedient kid out of a jam.</p><p>I know, I probably shouldn't even start with such a sacred cow, especially since I only got to book 3, but that's my beef.  Nobody has to agree with me.  Any if you want an example of what I'm talking about, read a few classics, like The Count of Monte Christo or Les Miserables.  Now those guys knew how to unravel a story.</p></div>

In fact, the more it grew into a craze, the less I wanted to join in.<br>It's kind of like a few years ago, when I had my heart set on going to Las Vegas because I've never been. But then it seemed like 6 of my co-workers went to Vegas on vacation in the span of 3 months or so and that completely quelled my desire to go. Guess I'm kind of weird that way.</p></div>

Not perfect, but then we can't expect that from the hand of man anyway.</p><p>The really sad thing is that many who hold such a negative opinion about the books choose not to read them. Kind of like those who bash CF but have never (or not recently) used it. Hard to share an educated opinion then.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Amusingly my wife reading potential spoilers online upset me more than an actual spoiler we read as I then spent some time wondering whether it was true or not.  Ultimately book 7 took so long to read (two days, reading it out loud) that I'd forgotten, but still..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Finished B3 about 10 minutes ago. Earlier today I picked up books 4-7 because - and I kid you not - I was worried about finishing a book and not having the next one ready. I'll be watching the 3rd movie on DVD in a bit. It's funny - I remember watching the 3rd movie now and falling asleep at parts and just being confused. Now it all makes sense.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just finished B5. I'm now going to movies. By some stroke of luck, M5 is still playing here, and I'll get to see a HP movie at the theater.</p><p>I cannot describe how much I'm enjoying these books. While they aren't the "coolest" SciFi/Fantasy books (China Mievelle wins there) nor is it the best writing I've seen (easily Milan Kundera), but I think these are probably the books that have been the most fun, exciting, and, ok, I'm gushing now so I'll stop.</p><p>Is it obvious I'm addicted? I'm leaving with the kids in 30 for the movies, but as soon as I catch up on email I'm going to get a few pages of B6 read.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Both the last two movies were fun - but REALLY miss out on the emotional subtlety that you get in the books. But - I figure they have to make _some_ sacrifices when moving an 800 page book to screen.</p><p>I read almost a 100 pages today. I should be on B7 by MAX, which means for the first time I'll actually be returning to my room early. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, I wrote this post on August 6th, and on October 6th I finished the series. I heard that the ending was very well done and I definitely have to agree. I'll keep my comments vague so as to not spoil anything. I am very - very happy I read this series. I've said it in my last few comments, but the books really gave me a lot of happiness and that makes them priceless to me. I'm actually thinking of rereading them next summer. (Or at least B1, which is still my favorite.)</p></div>
