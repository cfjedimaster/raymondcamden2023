		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep - it IS just a simple thing, but I think you see the UI used often. MOst sites have "things" in the nav that are square like. I do. And cfpod is a good way to encapsulate that. Also - I've seen cfpod used like a form fieldset and I think it works nicely that way.</p></div>
