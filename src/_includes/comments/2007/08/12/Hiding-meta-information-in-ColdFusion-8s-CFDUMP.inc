		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, do you know of a way to speed dump up? When I dump an equivalent structure (a biggun) on CFMX 6.1, it's probably 5 times faster than the same dump on CF8. It's possible that it's because on 6.1, the "collapse" only collapses the top level, where as on 8 it collapses every level. This is highly annoying because you have to do so many more clicks to drill down into what you want. Do you know of a way to get dump to work like it did on 6.1?</p></div>
