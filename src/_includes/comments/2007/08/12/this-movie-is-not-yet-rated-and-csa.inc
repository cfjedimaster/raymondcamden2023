		<div class="comment_text"><p>i saw part of this film is not yet rated. I can't remember but did they mention that big studios sometimes get away with more than independent movies. ie. possible big money makers get a pg-13 rather then a more deserved R.</p><p>I've noticed that. On a side note I beleive i recall them talking about the introduction of pg-13. We let our 9 yearl old daughter watch back to the future this summer. harmless enough, right? ha! the language was just terrible in it!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Kebab - Yep, I remember that as well. My main point is though that there is a difference between your government preventing you from seeing something and the MPAA giving movies unfair ratings. The MPAA is free to give whatever rating they want, but this movie is doing a good job informing people of how misguided their ratings may be.</p></div>
