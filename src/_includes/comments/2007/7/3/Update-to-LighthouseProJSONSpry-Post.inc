		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, I know you had made some samples, etc using the PagedView functions of Spry and I had built some stuff based on your examples. I recently changed my stuff to use the JSON dataset instead of XML. The grid works fine, the sorting works fine, but the paging doesn't work at all. I posted the code on the labs forum and the guys there don't see anything that looks wrong with the code, so I was just wondering if you had tried using json in combination with paging with any success yet?</p></div>
