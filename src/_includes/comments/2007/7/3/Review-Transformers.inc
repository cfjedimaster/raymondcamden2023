		<div class="comment_text"><p>yeah I wanted to go right back in line and see it again. It was like seeing old friends you haven't been able to visit with in awhile.</p><p>I had a few small gripes with it though, mostly minor:<br>- the lips on prime were just wrong.<br>- the lack of starscream or decepticon time vs all the human storyline time.<br>- The way they isolated one or two of the characters from the story, given the way it goes. I don't want to expound on this and give away movie parts though :P<br>- the backyard scene reminded me of the spiderman 3 jazz club - heavy handed and out of character for the prime that some of us grew up with. It wasn't bad just felt off.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's my only gripe.  Product placement.  I typically do not mind product placement.  I would much rather a character drink a Pepsi than a can that just says 'Cola', to me, it lends to the realism. I like it, and encourage it, when it makes sense.</p><p>What doesn't make is that every Autobot that transformed into an automobile or truck transformed into a GM vehicle. Come on, look around, you'll probably see a lot more Toyotas or even Hondas on the road.  I initially thought Barricade (the police car) was a Dodge Charger, but according to the website, he was a Saleen 5281 Mustang.</p><p>Also, I swear the voice of Optimus was the same guy from the cartoon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't seen the movie yet (maybe today), but I do want to comment on something Ray said: "If I had only one complaint - it was a bit too long."</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this trend in movies lately?  Over the last few years, movies have been getting longer and longer.  When The Lord Of The Rings trilogy came out, 3 hours was extremely rare (although not completely unheard of) for a movie length.  Now, I would wager that most movies are aiming for the 2 - 2 1/2 hour mark, and 3 hours is getting to be the standard for your big budget "blockbusters".</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love going to the movies and watching it on the big screen.  But if it's going to be so long that I can't sit through the entire thing without having to get up to go to the bathroom, then I'd rather just wait 'till it comes out on video so I can pause it.</p><p>(sorry to hijack the thread)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't think Transformers was too long.  I have sat through 3+ hour movies that seem to fly by, and I have sat through 90 minute movies that feel like they are 3+ hours.  For me it all has to do with the quality of the film, not the length.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll agree with that.  I don't mind the length that much if it's a good movie.  But you can only sit there for so long.  Eventually, you're going to get uncomfortable, keep shifting positions, your leg falls asleep, you're wife/girlfriend makes you go get her a drink at the best part of the movie, etc...  I was just commenting on the fact that more and more movies are creeping towards the 3 hour mark these days. (not to mention the 30 minutes of commercials you now have to endure before the 30 minutes of previews!)</p><p>Anyway, back to the Transformers.  I was talking with a friend of mine a couple of days ago, and she's really excited about the movie and just kept talking about how much she liked the cartoon series as a kid.  When I asked her what she thought about the first Transformers movie, the conversation when something like this:</p><p>ME: What did you think of the first Transformers movie?<br>HER: This is the first movie.<br>ME: No, the original movie based off the cartoon series in the 80's.  <br>HER: They made a movie?<br>ME: Yeah, you don't remember?  They killed Optimus Prime and almost killed Megatron but he was saved and turned into the psychotic Galvatron.  <br>HER: I never heard of that!<br>ME: It's at blockbuster, you should check it out.</p><p>Anyway, I may go check out the first one before I see this one, just for "old times sake".</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Eric - they re-released the 86 movie in the past year as the 20th anniversary edition with extras and some other cool stuff.</p><p>@Scott - it was Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus. Initially they said they wouldn't use him or were leaning away from him and the fans went ballistic. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or Peter nailed his audition but he got the part.</p><p>The voice of Megatron was replaced in the movie with Hugo Weaving. Bay said he thought the original Megatrons voice was too cartoony for a 40ft evil leader type. Its odd given the short amount of lines Megatron has in the movie. They did pull in the original voice of Megatron for the video games from this movie. Seemed odd.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@DK - Yeah, I would have loved to see more Decepticon time. Spoiler Alert: The comment that Megatron made to Starscream about him failing him... again... was one more example how perfectly they nailed the personalities.... I just wish they would have shown more.</p><p>@Eric - Yeah, movies ARE getting longer. Although I will say that LOTR was ok being long. LOTR was pure gold. Period. About the best darn movies ever made. I'd site through 8 hours of them. (Of course, all 3 together are what, 12 hours?)</p><p>@Scott - I woulnd't say it was _too_ too long... just a bit too long. ;) As I said -it was my only complaint.</p><p>@Eric - Believe it or not - I've never seen the first movie. I'm going to add it to my wishlist now.</p><p>As a final note - now that it is 24 hours since I've seen the movie, I can say that my appreciation for it has only grown. I'd go see it right now if it wasn't for the fact that I've had a few beers. (Ok, quite a few beers.) (Ok, way too many beers, but that's all good. Moosehead is good for the soul.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray--I have to agree 100%. I just saw 'Transformers' and it was excellent!  I was so nervous going into this movie, and my expectations were actually kind of low. I mean, I've waited 20 years for this.  I expected it to get messed up like every other remake.  But, I literally had goosebumps throughout the entire movie.  The Autobot personalities were nailed--dead on!  Peter Cullen's voice brought back my childhood instantly.  Bumblebee was awesome, too.  I can't really complain about anything in the movie.  I didn't think it was too long, because everything was relevant to the storyline.  I WILL be seeing it again!</p><p>I just hope if they re-do G.I. Joe they do as good of a job.</p></div>

The scene where Optimus and Megatron go crashing through the building (Megatron is in Plane form) is a direct nose-thumbing to the Silver Surfer scene in FF2. I think it might even be the same building.</p><p>Aside from that...there are no palm trees at Nellis AF Base (go Nevada).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with most of the comments. When I read that Peter Cullen was reprising his work as Optimus Prime I was thrilled. One of my favourite lines in the movie was when Sam and Mikala were in a tunnel riding in Bumblebee and she says, "...why does he always transform back in this 1975 POS?" At that point Bumblebee spins around and throws Sam and Mikala out of the car and drives off. As Sam gets up he says, "Now look what you've done, you've pissed him off! He's sensitive!"</p><p>Oh and one more thing, I wish they used more of the original transformation sound effect that you always heard in the cartoon. I think it was used only four times in the movie.</p></div>
