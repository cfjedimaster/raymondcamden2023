		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I echo your sentiments across the board.  I almost made a blog entry this morning solely about the food and the bed!</p><p>Having to move from one session room to another was definitely a drag, especially a couple of times when I was sitting happily next to a wall plug!  Considering all the positives, however, that is a pretty weak negative.</p><p>Great sessions by all.  There really wasn't a single "dog" out of any of the ones that I attended, and I feel that I picked up some new ideas and concepts to help me bump it up a notch or two in my own development for sure.</p><p>Glad I got a chance to sit and chat with you bit.  You aren't nearly as bad as everyone says. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>While I didn't stay at the hotel, I have to say the food and the company was excellent. This is my second time at CFobjective() and while last year was fantastic Jared and the rest really did an excellent job organizing. Maybe next year a small web app could be posted on the the cfobjective site to gauge interest in each session so that they would have an idea of what speakers are going to be most popular to get the biggest room. Great talks by all hope to see everyone again next year or at other CF or adobe events later this year.</p></div>
