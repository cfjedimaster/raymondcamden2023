		<div class="comment_text"><p>This reminds me of a few hair-pulling issues I've encountered with reserved words! One that had me going crazy for several hours (the error I got was ridiculously obscure and nothing like the actual problem) was that I was trying to pass a "username" parameter in a &lt;cfinvoke&gt; tag, and CF was understanding it as a security/roles user name, not the string value I wanted. That ordeal taught me to use CreateObject() instead.</p></div>
