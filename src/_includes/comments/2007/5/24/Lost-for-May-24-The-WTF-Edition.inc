		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got the impression that not everyone got off the island (Why else would Jack want to go back?).  Also, who's to say that Jack and Kate (and whoever else) got off the island as a direct result of the events of last night's episode?</p><p>Charlie dying was kind of lame.  Both him and Desmond easily could have had enough time to put on diving gear and get out before the entire station filled with water.  They could have even just jumped in the water and swam to the surface.  Just like Sylar slinking away into the sewer in the Heroes season finale, I think Charlie dying the way he did was juts lame, and took away from an otherwise awesome episode.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So who died in the funeral home?  I think it was Ben or Sawyer.  Locke stays on the island and other than Sayid, the rest had family that would have shown up to the funeral.  It was someone that Kate has some kind of relationship (good or bad) with.</p><p>I thought something was up when they covered all of the bodies except Mikhals. Then Charlie dieing made no sense to me either.  Just go out the hatch and shut the door behind you.</p><p>How does Kate get to stay out of prison? She was heading there when the plane crashed.</p><p>In summary, If I wanted to watch a bearded doctor with a drug problem I'd just watch House.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know. I can easily see Sawyer and Kate hooking up after leaving, then breaking up badly, which would account for her saying 'why would i go' when he died. So I think it was Sawyer. I think if Ben died he would spit on the grave.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the funeral home death was Juliette maybe. I can't think of anyone else that Kate would have acted incredulously about going to their funeral. I guess Ben, but I don't think he would leave the island no matter what. Also since it was a flash forward its not conclusive, its probably similar to Desmonds flashes. I think if you watch again the part with Jack talking to the other doctor when he mentions his father the other doctor looks at him a little off... I'm not sure if that means his father is still dead and everyone knows it crazy man on pills... or if it means he is alive but different. Anyhow yeah.</p><p>The Charlie thing was weird, I know he was resigned to die so Claire could be saved. I don't know, the writing and everything in that part felt very heavy handed. I honestly think they had taken his character as far as they could at this point, and it was a good time to write it off.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you recall Kate implies that there's someone she needs to get back to when she's talking with Jack at the end.  I think this is Sawyer.  This would lead me to believe that the casket contains some one else that rubbed people the wrong way and had no friends or family, i.e. Locke or Ben.  Also a long shot guess would be Michael, since he betrayed them and the funeral home seemed to be in a black neighborhood or black-owned.  (Funeral parlors have a long history of being racially separated.)</p><p>I also found it curious that Jack spoke of his father several times as if he was alive, both in the hospital and at the drug store.</p><p>Also, is this one possible future, or what is certain to come?</p></div>

Kate wouldn't care if Michael was dead, he took the boat out of Dodge, leaving them all on the dock with Ben.</p><p>And why is it that Locke couldn't kill his own father because "he wasn't a murderer", but had no problem launching his Rambo knife into Naomi's back?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Charlie's death, if he is in fact dead, rubbed me the wrong way. He could have made it through the broken window or both of them could have made it to the surface with one using dive gear. I can understand the argument though that he felt he had to die to save Claire and the baby.</p><p>By the way, my boss has a double vision problem right now and has an eye patch. He also has a similar hair pattern as Mikail, so everytime I look at him I think of Mikail.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One thing to consider. We assume that they got off after Jack radioed in. That may not be true. They may have gotten off years after that. So next season they could easily be back on the island, and the flash forwards could continue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Notice the loud noises part. And the "J". I'd bet it was James (Sawyer), and the loud noises implied he died a bad death. If things DID go bad for everyone, I'm sure Sawyer returned to a life of crime and it finally caught up with him.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think its Sawyer too. If you look the next letter after the "J" of the first name is clearly a round letter like either a lower-case "a" or "o". So James would fit but Im not sure what his last name is or if they have even said at anytime in the past. I wish I had season 1 on dvd so I could re-watch the epsisode where they realize Sawyers name isnt Sawyer and maybe they said his last name then.</p><p>I was happy about this finale. I think it keeps true to the whole philosophy of Lost. You answer a few questions but those answers lead to even more questions. Its those new questions that keep the story going.</p><p>I agree with the above comment about the flashbacks being over and now everything will be flash forwards. I think there will be a major shift in the story from here on out and the battle will be with this new group that is looking for the island.</p><p>Did anyone else find it weird that the instance that Charlie turned off the jammer, Penny was sitting at a desk sending a signal to the island?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think they're trying to show us more of what the island is. All these people had their 'sins' coming to the island. They island is redemption from the empty life that they came from. Notice how everyone has come to terms with their past and is able to move forward in a positive way?</p><p>Ben however is ignoring the island, and what it truly means and therefor is being stricken with cancer and ignored by the 'bearded ghost'. So this redemption that the island offers comes with a price... you have to live on sand, you have to struggle, blah, blah, blah. But you're happy d@mmit! and that's how we liked it... wait... uh, nevermind.</p><p>Charlie died to save desmond from seeing penny on the screen. If desmond had seen penny on the screen (which was waterproof) he wouldn't have left the room and would have drowned. Perhaps the actor (charlie) had a movie offer that he couldn't turn down and needed off the show.</p><p>The flash-forwards with jack weren't quite the same as the visions because we were seeing the result, not one of the islanders. BUT what question it does raise (if anyone caught it) is that locke said 'you're not supposed to do that'... just like the lady said to desmond when he tried to buy the ring.</p><p>I've got two theories<br>1 - the island is the long sought after 'fountain of youth' and the dharma initiative wanted to bottle it's properties and sell it to the world</p><p>2 - it's a experiment on humans to see if the react consistently when presented with the same situations over and over again (desmond's repeating timeline visions)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hated the flash forward bit and would strongly encourage the writers of Lost to keep away from using too many more in future episodes, sticking instead what worked for the entire span of the show prior to the experimental season three finale -very frustrating.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To angry fan -</p><p>When a show sticks to a formula, especially a sow like Lost, is when things get stale and people head for the door. There is no indication that they will be using the flash forward format many more times, let alone one more, because the unexpected nature of it is why it worked so well. The writers are talented enough to know that if every other show was a flash forward it would lose its meaning. I thought they brilliantly brought the future into this season's finale to give a glimpse of how their current actions weren't everything they seem to be.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Woahhhhhhhhhh!!!!<br>Finaly.... I knew what the newspaper clipping read:<br>"The body of John Lantham of New York was found shortly after 4 am in the 4300 block of Grand Avenue. Ted Worden, a doorman at the Tower Lofts complex, heard loud noises coming from the victim’s loft. Concerned for tenants’ safety, he entered the loft and found the body hanging from a beam in the living room. According to Jaime Ortiz, a police spokesman, the incident was deemed a suicide after medical tests. Latham (sic) is survived by one teenaged son. Memorial services will be held at the Hoffs-Drawlar Funeral Home tomorrow evening."</p><p>Plus check this out:<br>The funeral home's name is Hoffs-Drawler<br>Anyone noticed anything about it?!?!<br>Rearrange the letters to get FLASH-FORWARD</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We'll Scott P posted what he found as the newspaper clipping. And I've heard a few others mention "Tower"? There has been ties to Wizard of Oz. Maybe it's a hint since the Wizard was in a Tower and was the man behind the curtain. So maybe it "Jacod" or "Jake". No one ever said he was dead on the island.</p></div>
