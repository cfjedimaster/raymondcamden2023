		<div class="comment_text"><p>The gas explains what happened to the Dharma folks but I still wonder how did Ben get to be in charge?  And where did the natives come from?</p><p>It makes some since that this was the incident that was referred to, think about this:  Dharma sent others in to findout where their folks were.  Ben is good at manipulating  others so he could have convinced the search party from Dharma that something horrible happened and they gave him the authority.</p><p>He (Ben) has made contact with folks off the island - the video of the red soxs winning it and Juliette's sister on playground.</p><p>Being a workman and smart, he would have been around folks doing real work so he could have picked up enough knowledge on how to keep the place going.</p><p>Really - really good episode.  And Lockes not dead.  Him and starbuck are coming back.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hiya Ray,</p><p>I love your blog and CF projects, and I'm also a big "Lost" fan.  I also really like that you mix pop culture content with professional content because it's fun and more people really should do it.</p><p>However, I read your blog daily via RSS and I watch "Lost" weekly and sometimes I read your blog for CF-related posts before I get around to watching "Lost".  I'm a very spoiler-sensitive geek, so I was really unhappy to check my CF RSS feeds today and see "His name is Jacob" and the opening preview sentence to your post.  I find it kind of a spoiler, however minor, and that's just not cool.  I don't expect to have to watch out for "Lost" spoilers when I just want to catch up on insightful ColdFusion writings.</p><p>Perhaps you could just entitle "Lost"-related posts generically as "Lost for May 9" or "Lost s03e20" or what not, and maybe include a "spoiler warning" text at the start of it before launching into "Holy. Crap....", etc.?  I like to go into episodes not knowing anything about them and now I've got a set of pre-conceived notions and I'm bummed out.  I don't want to accidentally read anything more, so I'm going to have to skip reading your blog today and come back once I've watched "Lost", which is disappointing.</p><p>Sorry for the long comment, just wanted to say that I do like your blog and your pop culture writings, but please try to spare us the spoilers, however light, or warn us first somehow.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dave, all of my Losts posts are spoilers. All of them. So this wasn't new. I can see your point about the title... but if you knew nothing about the episode I don't see how it could reveal much. But - that being said - next time I'll just keep it to the title.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm more confused now than ever.  The same guy that tells Ben (as a young boy) to 'be patient' is the same guy who gave Locke the file on Sawyer (and he doesn't really appear to have aged any)...  Maybe the 'Natives' can't harm anyone but have to get others to do their bidding?</p><p>So maybe the spirits angle isn't far off.  But apparently there are a 'mix' of people on the island - the 'Natives' and then people like Ben and Juliette (and the crash survivors) from 'outside'.</p><p>I just wish the TV folks could work out some kind of rotating schedule so at least one cool show could be on instead of all of them ending with a long dry spell til new episodes.</p></div>

They did a good job of making Ben look nutso, then Locke hears "Help me". I also think Ben can see Jacob, but he can't hear him.

Especially not with the way the island heals people.</p><p>My favorite scene of Lost EVER was last night when Locke jumped on that eye patch guy and started beating his ass. Ben starts freaking and calls for Tom and Richard to do something and Tom just casually shrugs his shoulders and takes a drink of his coffee. Incredible!</p><p>I think Ben is definitely threatend by Locke. Thats why he shoots him. Especially after Locke nailed him as a liar.</p><p>Jacks character is starting to annoy me though.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First - let me address how they can have American accents. I think it is the same reason they can look like Ben's mom and Jack's dad. Remember the smoke monster can look into your past. If the smoke monster and the Natives are one - then we have a force that can read your mind. Therefore it is trivial to look and sound like something you are familiar with.</p><p>Second - Maybe Dharma isn't really sure what is going on the Island. Maybe they don't know about the massacre. Maybe they DO know but are working with tne Natives because... who knows - for power - money - whatever.</p></div>

But then she made the observation that it looks more like one of those old powered wigs.</p><p>Now if this is a spirit - and perhaps from the Black Rock - then that could make sense, could it not?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh I dont think they are 'native' to the island. Not in the sense that Native is usually thought of. But I dont think thats what Ray is implying either. I do believe they were there before Dharma.</p><p>I believe they had something to do with the Black Rock. Probably the crew and the island is preventing them from aging. And like Ben said, some of the others were brought to the island like Juliette.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you can take Native a few ways. Native can mean they are from there. If you take that meaning, then NO one is native from anywhere but Africa. Or you take it in the sense of 'been here long enough where they might as well be native'). I mean shoot, even the Native Americans walked over here, right?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that Ben lost his connection with the island and with Jacob and he was faking the conversation with him in front of locke. If Ben was able to hear Jacob he would have heard him say "help me", only Locke heard that. Another thing, Ben can't let the others know that he lost his connection with the island, that's why he shot Locke.</p></div>
