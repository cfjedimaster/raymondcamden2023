Ha ha... my wife and I were going through some boxes of old clothes the other day and I found a goldish color, long-sleeve t-shirt with the spectra logo embroidered on it that I got from somewhere and never wore! I cant remember if it was at the 2000 Allaire Conf in DC or something they sent me during my stint as the JaxCFUG president.</p><p>I will post a photo on my site tomorrow just for nostalgia sake.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I dont think its the marketing thats amiss. I think the bigger issue is that, just like PHP, its free. Now ColdFusion is free to develop on. But, if you want to deploy that site somewhere tis going to cost you and cost you big if you run your own server.</p><p>Linux hosting with PHP and Ruby is CHEAP these days, you can even get a decent single processor server with a gig of ram these days for around $89 a month. Now if Im paying $89 a month for my server chances are Im going to go with something free like PHP or Ruby vs. spending a lot of cake on a CF server just for my personal sites. (Not me mind you, but other people)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How will it cost you big? Yes it costs money to pay for CF. But if I can get something done in half the time, with more features, than it is worth the cost. I just don't get how people look at ONE facet of price only. It's like Windows. While I've complained about Windows, I'd rather pay the price for the OS than use Linux since Windows is easier to use.</p><p>Anyone who says the price is the ONLY concern does NOT have a full view of what 'cost' really entails.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray</p><p>I know price is not the only concern but look at all the areas that are eventually affected by price. Ultimately the price drives out opensource development. I know RIAForge has done GREAT things to improve upon this but I feel like the lack of opensource options even further push new developers away from CF.</p><p>Development time is still sort of relevant to this discussion but when you combine it with the lack of opensource applications, theres no comparison. Granted we all know you can code a comparable app is CF in less time than you can in PHP but when I can use a free CMS and a free shopping cart system written in PHP that are full-featured apps and only need to skin them for a client, I just saved a BUNCH of time (and money). This again is affected by price.</p><p>Dont get me wrong. I have been coding CF for 10 years now and I LOVE it and have no plans to move away from it, BUT I think things need to change a bit to help grow the programmer base and get new users into CF. In my opinion, its the cost that is killing CF in the battle against languages like PHP and Ruby.</p><p>Hopefully Railo and Smith will help to solve that in the near future.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree there is a lot more OS in PHP, but CF is growing. We can't treat it like a chicken/egg thing or it will never improve. More and more OS stuff is released every week. If folks say 'it isnt as good as PHP', than that is like giving up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah... I agree with you there Ray.</p><p>Im not giving up. I would just LOVE to see Adobe release CF Standard as a free product for hosting. I mean really, its not like its little Allaire anymore.</p><p>I think if they were to offer the CF standard server for free, you would see a HUGE boom in new developers and other companies adopting CF as well. Then Adobe can upsell the Enterprise version or all of the other things like Flex that go along with it. This would be the adrenaline shot that CF would need to jump in the ring and fight it out like a true contender.</p><p>I guess too that those of us who have opensource apps should do the right thing and make sure that our apps run on Railo as well. And really promote that fact.</p></div>
