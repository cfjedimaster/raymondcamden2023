		<div class="comment_text"><p>ABC has a great reputation for killing off shows.  Usually it is because they move them around so darn much you never know when they are on...   I actually have not started watching any new shows that they air because they may be here 1 week and gone the next....  Very Frustrating!!!</p><p>-Randy</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Arghhhh.  I really was loving this show lately.  Found myself rooting for the town of Jericho.  Ray, you wrote about this scenario months ago and now here it is.  The networks suck you in and then cancel the series.  We need closure.  My favorite character was Hawkins.  We need to know what happens next.  Put it in a book.  I will buy it.</p></div>

It would be nice if another network such as Sci Fi would pick it up and run with it.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tv is really getting depressing. FX(nip/tuck, the shield, rescue me) and HBO(too many to list too bad most are over now) and Showtime(Dexter) got it right and the big networks aren't worth investing your energies into half the time when it comes to picking regular shows to watch. You get attached then find out the magic number of 7 million viewers extrapolated from an antiquated measuring system isn't enough for it to air any longer.</p><p>I think nbc cancelled the black donnellys, studio 60, crossing jordan and a few others and put this in their places:</p><p>singing bee - people get up and sing backed by a band and have to keep going once the band stops (all they need is some chairs for the people to fight over .....)</p><p>baby borrowers - people loan their baby (as young as 6months old wtf???????) to teen couples to teach them how to be a responsible adult parent. I guess the idea is hilarilty must ensue?</p><p>world moves - mix dancing with stars minus the stars with american idol.</p><p>man.... its painful to see it in print again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What I love is comments like the one from the ABC guy who said that serialized shows just don't work with audiences. Do you know why, you moronic SOB? Because your damned networks keep pulling the shows after a few airings (Vanished, Reunion, Daybreak, The Nine, etc, etc), leaving audiences stranded, or doing what ABC did to Lost this year and what CBS did to Jericho - put it on for a few  months, then yank it from mid-October until mid-February, by which point no one cares anymore! I really like the whole concept of a serialized show, but I'm not going to pick up another one. If one comes on that looks interesting and succeeds, I'll get it on DVD, but I'm not going to make the commitment again.<br>I something in TVGuide awhile back that was predicting that Jericho would get canceled because it wasn't drawing the numbers in the second half of the season that it did in the first half, but of course didn't mention that those numbers probably dropped because everyone forgot what was happening. I'm really glad that ABC is going to hold off Lost until February so that they can show it back-to-back. The networks all need to get a damned clue, dump the 1950's Sept - May schedule, and instead have three "seasons" of shows - one in the fall/winter, one in the winter/spring, and one in the spring/summer, and then run shows continuously through the season instead of losing viewers on quality shows like this.<br>Since Galactica is on hiatus until next Feb as well, Jericho really was the best show on TV.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anyone who watched Babylon 5 back in the day knows how stupid the major networks are.  Just like the movie and music studios, they want everything and are unwilling to recognize the stupidity of their actions.  They take an involved, braincells-required show and:<br>* bounce it all around the week's schedule (B5),<br>* show it at a time that really does not work for the target audience (Firefly),<br>* show it so erratically and mix in repeats so that only the most loyal of fans (who read articles online to know WTF is going on) can keep up with the continuity (almost every show).  Lets call this the Jitterbug scenario.</p><p>This last one IMHO is what kills more shows than anything else - network are used to all these one-off shows that could be shown in any order that they don't seem to understand that cerial stories need to be shown in a preordained order, and that if you mess with it that the casual viewers will get ticked off and stop watching.  For example The X-Files was about 90% one-off episodes with about 10% of longer term story arcs, so as such wasn't affected too much by the jitterbugs, as compared to e.g. BSG, B5, etc.</p><p>For comparison sake, with the movie industry you have the studios paying hundreds of millions of dollars for these elaborate flicks that typically are either poorly conceived (who wants to see a remake of Poseidon Adventure less than a year after Halmark released their own?), poorly executed (The Matrix was awesome, but Matrix 2 and 3 felt rushed; Eragon had a great dragon but the rest was crap), too bland ("Oh My Goodness I Shrunk Our Fifteen Kids With Their 101 Dogs But The Cats Are OK 4: Johnny Eats Pudding", or all of the Me Too rip-offs &amp; sequels), or just crap (anything by Uwe Boll, anything on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimdb.com%2Fchart%2Fbottom%29%3A2czdSDh53IFDiS-fqTpDyEdCJwo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://imdb.com/chart/bottom)">http://imdb.com/chart/bottom)</a>.  At the same time of hawking this crap, the studios are also pushing DVD sales and expensive home entertainment systems, but still bitching that ticket sales are suffering (no, they aren't sales are up year over year).  Oh, and here's a new movie format that is completely incompatible with the other companies' but ours is better, and please buy all your movies again.</p><p>IMHO the main reason that B5 survived to finish was because JMS is (apparently) so good at budgeting, he kept every single episode within budget so that it couldn't be cancelled on pure monetary grounds.</p><p>The sooner that someone works out a good business plan for making serious TV shows work via direct DVD sales the better; that said, the B5 universe is being continued (no, Joe, please stop it, enough is enough!) via direct-to-DVD movies so if they manage to do well (his last effort, Legend of The Rangers, was truly terrible so I'm not holding my breath) the concept may have a chance.</p></div>
