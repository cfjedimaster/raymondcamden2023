		<div class="comment_text"><p>The best part of being a cf developer and having a mac is the windows emulation.  I have virtual machines setup for each configuration that I need.  If Windows becomes corrupt simply restore from a backup.  No more re-installing Windows or CF, no more bogging down Windows with 2 different versions of cf and 2 different database systems all fighting over system resources.  If you or your readers have any questions feel free to email me.</p><p>here's the geeky details</p><p>hardware<br>-----<br>macbook pro w 2gb ram, 2.33 ghz intel core 2 duo (with 2gb I can run os x, itunes, firefox, and windows xp with tons of stuff running).</p><p>software<br>-----<br>neo office (better than mac version of open office)<br>vmware fusion (better than parallels, still in beta, which means it's free)</p><p>vmware windows instances (all xp pro)<br>-----<br>cf8b2, sql server 2k<br>cf7, sql server 2k<br>cf7, oracle 9i<br>cf6.1, sql server 2k</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm a Mac guy from way back but, because of work and finances, have had to spend a lot of time with Windows for the last few years. I finally got an Intel Mac at home and now I'm happily migrating to it as my primary machine. It's a happy thing. The only thing bumming me out now is that delivery of my new MacBook Pro has been delayed and I won't have it in time for cf.Objective. Have to borrow a ThinkPad from work :-P</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't have the pleasure of owning a Mac yet. I hope to get one just to satisfy the geek in me that wants one of every kind of computer and gadget and software.</p><p>Although, maybe I should just stick with XP. I am a long-time WinXP user and I am kinda' afraid I wouldn't have a support group to help me detox from continous worry over my OS. Oh my goodness! How could I live with feeding my habit of frequent system restore points!</p><p>Sorta' on topic, I would like to put in a shameless plug for the Ubuntu distros. In the past I spent countless hours "debugging" "fixing" etc. my wife's "Designed for XP" laptop. About 3 months ago out of frustration with WinXP I put Ubuntu and Open Office on her laptop. Honest to God! I haven't had to touch her computer since.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"The best part of being a cf developer and having a mac is the windows emulation" How ironic. Buy a computer that emulates an OS you are trying to get away from, even though the computer you are emulating does everything the computer you bought does.</p><p>Owning a Mac is a merely status symbol. It cracks me up mostly because everyone switching to Mac that I know has to use Parallels. And is probably still using MS Office... in other words, you pay twice the licensing fees (yep, you still have to have a fully licensed and legit, non-OEM version of Windows) to do the same thing.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I use Mac and like it fine. I just have seen absolutely no reason to switch.</p></div>
