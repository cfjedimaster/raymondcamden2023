		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm one of the people who actually watched this show at the beginning, and who thought the idea sounded really cool. I could imagine so many cool possibilities in a cut off town during a nuclear attack and its aftermath. I was really disappointed with where the show ended up going. Saving kids from burning libraries? Fights with the father of the hero's girlfriend? I gave up around that time. Even still, I wouldn't mind finding out more about what the underlying causes of the attack were.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The producers of the show can certainly do something to give 'closure' to the series if they aren't going to continue it. When John Doe was canceled they put out a press release from one of the executives at Fox explaining the secret behind John Doe knowing everything. The folks at CBS could do something similar at the very least.</p></div>

They are all looking for original programming, maybe its legal trouble. I know HBO lists their upcoming shows but man some look terrible.</p><p> I know the nbc-cancelled drama The Black Donnellys was picked up last week by <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhd.net%3AI6nPgrWjroZamnVgQuSqP44bzJ0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hd.net">hd.net</a> to re-run season 1 in june, no word on more episodes though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Closure isn't quite what many folks are looking for. Continuation with closure over time is what folks seem to want.</p><p>Personally, it reminds me why I don't like to get into network TV, you simply don't know if the story is going to stop midstream and either never have closure, or have some sort of contrived closure that devalues the rest of the production.</p><p>Similarly interesting recent shows that have been canceled, prematurely in my opinion:</p><p>Commander in Chief<br>Surface<br>Jack and Bobby</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well I'll be damned.  I had no idea it was cancelled.  I just knew it wasn't showing up on my DVR anymore!  The love stories were so painfully overbearing in the series, yet the underlying whodunit aspect was strong enough for me to keep watching weekly.  I think they missed the boat on Jericho.  They could have done so much with the series, like each season returning back to the day of the attack in a different town... of course the name of the show would be kind of silly then, huh? :)</p></div>
