		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim, too bad your grandfather never heard of compassion for others or taught it to you.  Forcing animals to fight each other to the death for *your* enjoyment is sick and inhumane.  It doesn't matter what your income level or profession, it just goes to prove that even "smart" people can be as ignorant as anyone, or more so in this case.</p><p>I also wouldn't use a boxer (well known or not) in my defense, they make their livings beating the crap out of others so their opinions of blood sports are going to be skewed. Also, most boxers develop brain damage fairly early on from their chosen careers.</p><p>As for heritage, if it was in my family's heritage to publicly flog anyone named Jim would you also defent my "rights"?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim used a boxer to show about the jobs people have who fight chickens. If you would have been paying attention he also said doctors and lawyers. I think taht your just an idiot Damien. Who knows? Maybe your the one thats working fastfood. For your information you have to have money to take of chickens. You probably didn't take that into consideration though. Most cockfighters have very good jobs. Over 50% of them probably make more money than you. So spin that around your hard head.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nick: I was paying attention, though it seems you weren't.  My point on the boxer was that a boxer makes their living from bloodsports so they're not too likely to argue *against* cockfighting.  I don't care if the cockfighters are the richest people on the planet, and I'd be surprised if doctors and lawyers weren't making more than me, but at least I don't get my jollies watching animals beat each other to death.  He was trying to defend this inhumane "sport" by saying that doctors and lawyers do it so it must be ok.  To take enjoyment from watching two animals fight to the death is pretty messed up, I'm surprised that anyone is seriously trying to defend it.  What next, people marching on DC in defense of bumfighting?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would like to let you, who have never seen roosters fight, that they fight for territory regaurdless of where they are, in the barn,under a tree,in a 50 acre pasture, or in a pit , they still fight to the death, its there nature to fight for territorial grounds just as "ALL ANIMALS DO" its natures way of breeding the strongest of a breed for gauranteed survival.Just be glad that we humans don't do this because most people "you know, the ones who have nothing to do but bother people who aren't hurting anyone" would have been nocked out of the breeding chain along time ago.I guess its cruel to lock fish up in an aquarium too, maybe they should all be turned loose in the open seas where they can be gulped up by larger fish.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim, again, there's a difference between natural actions in natural situations and forcing animals to fight each other to death.  Farmers tend not to keep multiple males of a species where territory is an issue - chickens, cattle, whatever, so these scenarios tend not to occur in normal situations with domesticated animals.  With wild animals they also tend not to fight to the death, it tends to be bravado where one sight fights off the other, but both sides usually survive afterwards.</p></div>

No I am not going to tell everyone what I make but I probably make more money than a lot of you that have posted stuff about these birds that don't know anything except for the fact that you think that this is cruel you know what you are entiled to your own opinion but until you know what you are talking about just sit down and be quiet.......</p></div>

Again, I've pushed the notion that with normal farming practices and with in-the-wild behaviour roosters would generally not get into situations where they end up fighting to the death, so again your point is moot.</p><p>So does anyone have a valid argument to why this despicable practice should be allowed? "Tradition" - nopers.  "The organizers have money / fancy careers" - nopers. "The animals will do it anyway" - nopers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a Texas boy raised on a game farm the traditon of cockfighting has been with me since I was old enough to say "I got a dollar on the grey."  I enlisted in the Army and have not been stateside in five years. Now a sport and way of life that instilled heritage and pride in me is being outlawed. The same heritage and pride that allows me to fight for my country.  I am not asking everyone to like it. I will not even try to justify it, but outlawing a sport that even our founding fathers took part in is crazy.  I guess I better take some leave and take my son to a derby before its to late.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It absolutely boggles my mind that you people are actually trying to defend a "sport" that promotes murdering a living animal. You make reference that these species fight inherently. Maybe so but they don't outfit themselves with razors and spikes. It's people like you that have little or no respect for the life of beautiful creatures that God has given us and as much as it really sickens me that this cruelty exists, it's even worse to imagine a group of human beings - beings that should be looking after these animals - are actually cheering and betting on the brutal and senseless death of a creature brought into this world just to live its life. I guess certain groups of people just never evolved from the barbarian era.</p></div>

If the majority wanted it to be against the law for you to fish,hunt,or even watch tv does that make it a just law.  No!!  Know it don't.  The constituin says in the pursuit of happiness and just because the majority votes to make cockfighting against the law does not make it right!!  Just think about what I said real hard because the majority will also vote and make it against the law for something you enjoy.  So when they do don't dare to say a word.
