		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, we just want to be able to find people or know if they are in the office. Tracvking every minute move is nto the issue at all. At least, if I have to go pee , I am not chaning mine :). The boss just wants to have a place to check on where folks are in case he needs someone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, some IM would be best suited for that.  Or, if you wanted to get tricky, you could setup an "In/Out" IM account, tie it to a gateway in CF, IM it from your account with your status, and have it displayed on an internal site.  I know I usually IM my buddies that I'm heading to lunch or an offsite meeting, so IMing the In/Out account would be a natural extension to that.</p><p>Have done the STE in a while, but loved it the few times I did back in the day.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, I built a CF "in-out" board, it worked when the dept was split into 2 different rooms..but when we moved into one room nobody used it..I'd go with a IM solution also.</p></div>
