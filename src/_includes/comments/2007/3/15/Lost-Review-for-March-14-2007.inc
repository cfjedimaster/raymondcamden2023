		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I don't think that the others think some people are better than others.  The Russian Guy said that certain people are not on the list because they are "Flawed".  Maybe flawed means they have either directly or indirectly resulted in someone's death?</p><p>I agree i think the past two episodes have been much better.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I liked a lot of different parts of this episode.</p><p>Could Claire have acted more like the typical teen even down to the unattractive dye job?  I was glad to see her calling Desmond out on the inconsistencies she had been seeing.</p><p>I don't know if it's just me but I am beginning to feel more sympathy for Jack's dad.  We've only had to deal with Jack for 3 seasons.  he had years of Mr. Sanctimonious.</p><p>Though part of me thinks he should have still been worrying about where Kate was, it was cool to see Sawyer just hanging out watching the goings on at the beach with his bemused expression.  And I liked how Sun caught him before he could play Mr. NickName again.</p></div>

Someone did/said something that cut him off before he finished that sentence.</p><p>Locke knew the fence was hot so he pushed him into it.  So far Locke has blown up the hatch and now the house.  Something is going on with him.</p><p>The Jack playing football scene really wasn't a big deal for me.  You are stuck on an island and have vowed to get Ben better.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Scott, RE: Jack playing football scene really wasn't a big deal for me.</p><p>I personally thought this scene was very strange. Almost like it was a doppleganger--not the real Jack. He seemed too "happy" to be the real Jack. Also seemed too buddy-buddy with the other guys on the island.</p><p>Also, since it wasn't pointed out yet, this is the village we first see when The Others are introduced at the beginning of the 2nd season (or whatever episode we first see the Others witness the plane crash.)</p></div>
