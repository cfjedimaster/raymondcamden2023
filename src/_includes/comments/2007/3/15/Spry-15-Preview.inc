		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very happy to see JSON support- although it does mean that I have some re-writing to do.</p><p>Also too a quick look at the API.  I have always said that one thing that Allaire/Macromedia did better than anyone else was easy to use documentation.  Taking a look at the Spry 1.5 API, it's great to see that Adobe is following that tradition.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for pointing that out Ray. It's getting really exciting in Spryland. I hope that they'll produce a reduced file size at some point, but that's probably the last thing on their list.</p><p>The session additions intrigue me as well, but that will take some time to figure out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, Don't know if you have had time to try out <br>Spry's JSON. Well I have and it is a bit faster but the cfjson.cfc formats a query different from your queryToXML. As a result I modified your queryToXML. It is now queryToJSON. Here is my code: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcodeshare.ulatu.com%2Fmar4be3e%3AXYU0It6fUHZN-oZxplXnBeY07H4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://codeshare.ulatu.com/mar4be3e">http://codeshare.ulatu.com/...</a><br>Please, feel free to use as your own.</p></div>
