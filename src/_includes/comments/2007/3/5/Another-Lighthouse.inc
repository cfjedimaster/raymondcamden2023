		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am glad you did decide to blog about this issue. Perhaps a simple email to the developers showing them that you have had that name for a similar open source project (providing urls and dates) for quite some time maybe all it takes. Otherwise, being new to open source, I would raise the level up a bar and take a more serious action on it. Again, I don't know how Open-source projects do that. I am assuming that you have applied the Apache license to this one, Ray?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I guess that's for you to decide. I doubt it would be malicious, probably just a coincidence. Since your product isn't commercial, I guess if I were you I wouldn't care much. But you could let them know for the sake of avoiding confusion, because people searching for stuff on it could confuse the two.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - a lot of references to your version are titled lighthouse pro. I think that may be small issue if you ever did consider taking it any farther. I'm no legal person though /shrug</p><p>The beacon tie-in they have is pretty slick marketing type btw :P</p></div>
