		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was serving in the military @ Ft. Polk in '95 when someone in my unit mentioned going to see a cockfight.  That was how I found out it was legal.  I remember just feeling sad.</p><p>I'm an unabashed bleeding heart when it comes to animals, but it also made me sad because LA is a great state.  I lived there for a few years as a young kid and stayed for several years after I got out of the Army.  Stuff like this just reinforces the opinions of so many that the state is backwards and the people who live there are uneducated rednecks.</p></div>
