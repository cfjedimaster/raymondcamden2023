		<div class="comment_text"><p>Andy, that is exactly what I'm asking. I have two mod-chipped original X-boxes that have bigger drives than the new 360. The only thing I can't do is play the new 360 games but I hardly play all the xbox games I have now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'll be honest at the moment the harddrive size isn't a problem for me. But the graphics on the 360 are stunning, especially if you have a HD tv. The handiness of wireless remotes is just amazing. The amount of controllers i've seen busted cause of the cables. Plus with the 'Elite' you're now getting the HDMI player as well. I never went online with my old Xbox but the XboxLive on then 360 is just call and easy to use. Peronsally, its just worth the money to upgrade.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah the price increase is a little steep but if you consider how many people have been buying them you have to admit how much of a difference just painting a white product black is worth...especially in the gaming comunitry</p></div>
