I can VERY highly recommend them.</p><p>QA Dude: We did test rather heavily. As I stated, the main issue was _old_ URLs. My code is as perfect as you, QA Dude, whoever you are.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, there are always those who think they are the "superior coder"...  One thing I have learned in my 20+ years in the industry - NOBODY is perfect (present company excluded of course).  I spent hours testing one section of code I had written on a project - I was sure it had been "idiot proofed"... then someone built a better idiot and crashed my code in 3 minutes by doing something so off the wall I would never have thought about even ATTEMPTING it.  But THEY did.  At least YOU knew how to fix the break in a timely manner (unlike some large mega-corporations that shall remain nameless - cough cough cough-rosoft.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, speaking of testing...<br>It always reminds me of my first job.  I had plenty of time to test an Order Header/Order Detail application.<br>I always tested an Order with 1 or 2 lines items.<br>Can you predict what happened the night we went live?<br>Of course the first order came in for over 100 line items and a behavior popped up that I hadn't anticipated.<br>I told my fellow workmates "I could have tested for 100 years and wouldn't have duplicated that error".<br>This might have relevance to TDD today.  If you setup your TDD to test for 1 or 2 line items, you might feel confident everything is working fine - even more so if the tests are run every build.<br>So we're not out of the soup yet.</p></div>
