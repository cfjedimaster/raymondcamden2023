		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not sure of how I feel about the inclusion of FCKEditor. I've used it a fair bit in the past (including modifying BlogCFC to use it :) - but in some regards I think there are better options out there. I understand that CF will not in anyway force you to use FCKEditor over any other you've used in the past, but still..... As I said, not sure of how I feel about that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I default to using FCK because I've already got code written to implement it, but I absolutely detest the way that it rewrites some styles. I also hate that you have to manually configure a file browser. I hope that Adobe implements that on the back side without us having to do it manually.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I personally could careless about anything new that they added to CF8. All of the CF7 features works great and it's exactly what I need for the projects I do.</p><p>What I'm interested in is what they fixes in CF8 that is broken in CF7. The biggest thing that comes to mind is the reporting stuff and cfdocument (getting the style sheets to play nice is a nightmare.)</p><p>Other than that, I would hope that they make the product faster and on par with Railo with memory consumption in terms of object creation.</p><p>Eyecandy is great, because when you can't see, what good is it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tony: Speed was mentioned on the WebDU post. Tim said - Faster. Also - have you seen RIAFOrge? It is running CF8. Seem slow to you? :)</p><p>As for cfdocument, the #1 tip is to remember to use COMPLETE html pages. Ie, use all the tags you normally would in a "complete" HTML page.</p></div>

I think I was sitting next to the guy from flashmagazine as that was announced (or at least he looked like he was updating flash magazine!)</p><p>I think the inclusion of FCKEditor is good.</p><p>Ive noticed that Adobe are more and more including Open source projects where they can instead of re-inventing the wheel.</p><p>- Adobe Flex IDE is an eclipse (Open Source) addon<br>- Adobe Apollo is using an Open Source HTML Rendering framework....</p><p>These were both announced at WebDU yesterday...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@franktopia: I hear you. Customer services keep here complaining about it. So much so that they now know HTML and modify the source directly. We've also modified the code to add BRs when pressing shift-enter (and Ps on pressing enter).</p><p>@ray: I might be mistaken, but riaforge seems like a small application, so I'm not sure it cab be seen as an example of how fast scorpio is.</p></div>
