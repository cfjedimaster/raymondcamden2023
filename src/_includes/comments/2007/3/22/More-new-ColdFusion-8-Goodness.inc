		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've honestly never used cfform in my entire (short) CF career. The main reason is everyone I work with always says argggghhh nooooooo. They usually point to the bloated JS that gets included and also say that it has some insecure issues similar to cflogin.</p><p>Anyone care to expound on this a bit more or disagree? Just looking for some more information since so many things are being added to cfform :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What if somebody just want to use the function without cfform.<br>I don't use cfform and have developed equivalent to some of the new features in Scorpio because I didn't want to close options/doors for future growth/development.</p><p>It's not the end of the world but it's annoying.</p><p>It would be nice to have the choice.</p><p>Fred</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You do have a choice. Use CFFORM and you get all sorts of functionality but relinquish some control, do it yourself and you get whatever you want and more control. CFFORM is never needed, it's a simplicity and productivity tool for those who want it, recognizing that there is a cost in doing so. It's just like using Verity in ColdFusion, or charting, or anything else. These are there to make life simpler, if they work for you, great. If not, pick whatever works and use that.</p><p>--- Ben</p></div>
