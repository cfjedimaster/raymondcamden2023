		<div class="comment_text"><p>Pretty sweet Ray!  Thanks for posting this.  I just finished updating Flex Builder, installing Apollo and all that stuff here ath ome, and decided before I went to bed (now that the basketball games are over for the night).. I thought I'd check Google Reader to see if anything interesting had been blogged since last time.</p><p>Lo and behold, now I have another way to aggregate you and ben forta's blogs =)</p><p>Pretty amazing that it's all HTML and AJAX!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was relieved when I saw this during some of the Apollo presentations. That's great. Nice to know I don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to learn yet another language to do fun Apollo stuff. It appears, too, that they don't want to make developers taking the AJAX approach to feel like lesser citizens by having decreased support for the HTML/JavaScript approach, but I fear this may happen. For instance, how will I have offline support for an Apollo app that uses AJAX for its data connectivity?</p></div>
