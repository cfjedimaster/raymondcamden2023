		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good stuff.</p><p>The last time I played with Vue authentication and routing I was running Nuxt and using Auth0 for securing access. Generally I would switch layouts (easier to do with Nuxt) based on whether the user was authenticated or not; non-authenticated users get the landing page, authenticated users got the whole shebang. I like how you handle it as well.</p></div>
