		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is a bit steamy. I don't remember particular "steamyness" in the first episode. In general, I wouldn't let me 5 year old watch it. My 13 year old - sure - most likely - ask me in 8 years. ;) It's nothing R rated, at worst PG-13. Normally this kind of stuff doesn't bug me, but it seems to "stick out" for me in this series for some reason. It's like they go just a little bit too far. It doesn't ruin the series for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray -</p><p>I love the series.  I too find it, at times, to be a bit steamy.  I think the reasom it sticks out is because we would expect it from The OC, or some other prime time soap opera, but I didn't expect it from The Sci-Fi Channel, exspecially in BSG.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's a great series, but dark.  I loved the original when I was a kid. This one is a different beast all together, but still great.  Would my kids watch it, not likely.</p></div>
