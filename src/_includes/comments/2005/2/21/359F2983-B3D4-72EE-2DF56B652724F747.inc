		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, not really related, but you might want to shoot over to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%3Ad2YdfXYmoQKnf49i0ig9WEHnLgU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.xbox.com">www.xbox.com</a> and make sure your xBox isn't one of the ones being recalled for potentially faulty power cord.  I checked the other day, and mine was, so I signed up for a new cord through their site.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, thq only handles audio on the game, its like dolby surround or something.  I doubt they will be able to help. I would imagine nick games would be the one to contact.  Very interested on how this turns out though!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We recently had to return a Game Cube game because it ceased to function.  It looked like there was a pretty good scratch in it.  Nintendo gave me an RMA number, I took the disc to FedEx Kinko's, gave them the number, they shipped out at no charge. About 3 weeks later, I had a new disc.</p><p>Let's hope your experience is as uneventful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ryan - I'm not sure I agree with you. When I went to THQ, they had a full support site for a large number of games. An audio-only company wouldn't have that. In fact, they also seem to sell wireless gear.</p></div>
