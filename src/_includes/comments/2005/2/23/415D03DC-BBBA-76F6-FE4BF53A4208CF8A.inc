		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure you're being reasonable in expecting them to replace the damange DVD at all. While you only purchased a license to use their software, you do own the physical media that it shipped on (the DVD). If they had given you a defective DVD, then by all means the retailer should have replaced it for free. But what makes you think they have an obligation to replace a DVD that you owned and broke, just because it makes it impossible for you exercise your rights under the license? What if your computer (or game console or TV) got broken--it would be equally impossible for you to exercise your license rights, but you wouldn't expect them to replace your computer, right? I don't see how the DVD is different (actually, I do--somewhat--but I'm making a devil's advocate argument here).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I kinda see your point, Vince. The thing is - if I had the right to reproduce the media then I could be responsible if the media is damaged. I have no rights to do that. That by itself makes this a special case I think.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's absolutely not THQ's fault that the DVD is scratched up.  However, since they refuse to allow you (the user) to protect yourself from such issues (by saying you can't duplicate the media, even if you don't violate the single-use license), they're putting themselves in a position where they're the only one who can possibly deal with the scratched DVD.  However, the $15 is preposterous for new media.  You're not buying new rights, just media, so the price should reflect that.  But then if media giants had any kind of grip on reality....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Persoanlly this is why I believe in, "if you can copy it, copy it". I'm saying to pirate the game, I'm saying that if you can make a backup, do so. I never understood why it is suck a greyarea to make a copy of something just so you have it as a backup.</p><p>Point in case. My father bought MSSQL 2000 ENTERPRISE for 10 GRAND, with a "G". You don't think I made a backup of the cds and threw them into his safe. Imagine if one day I had to reinstall that puppy, only to discover the disks were unreadable or lost. I'd have a heartattack.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love what you have done in this "research", that's why I take on this issue much like the infamous "mattress tag" law... If you make a copy of the DVD in your house, you are not passing it to your friends and family, but simply keeping it stored with the rest of your DVD collection or on the same super advanced safe that you keep your copy of your treasured windows backups :) then the DVD police is very likely to show up as often as the mattress police... ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Phill, the matress tag is a very different beast.  If you read it, it's only illegal to remove the tag if you're not the consumer.  So if you purchase the matress, you're free to remove the tag.  The DVD's license, on the other hand, explicitly states that you, as the consumer, are not permitted to duplicate it.</p></div>
