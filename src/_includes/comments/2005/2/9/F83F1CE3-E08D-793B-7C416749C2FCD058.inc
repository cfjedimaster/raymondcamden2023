		<div class="comment_text"><p>charlie,<br>i think the synching is dependant on the types of calendaring software you have installed on your ppc.  If the app supports iCal then it should be possible to synch the to together.</p><p>As to Max and sharing informations on the interanet - yeah you can share tasks - again they are just stored in the iCal format.  YOu just have to be subscribed to that persons iCal file.</p><p>One solution (not necessarilly the best) is to have the iCal file stored on a shared location and  read it from there.  A better solution is to use webDav and auto publish all of your calendars to the webDav server -then other users would subscribe to them via the webDav server.</p><p>I use a webbased calendar to publish my sunbird iCal files to my blog.  Since my server doens't support webDav I have a simple batch file that uploads my iCal file and downloads my wifes.  It makes for an easy sync operation that works nicely for both home and work computers.  You can see the webcal at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fphpicalendar.net%2F%3ASeMe4uLpQ3w576gEgI6VQbPwm_g&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://phpicalendar.net/">http://phpicalendar.net/</a> or my personal usage of it at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frawlinson.us%2Fcalendar%2F%3APAtC7CBajmbleFmqpEhxXoY051Q&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rawlinson.us/calendar/">http://rawlinson.us/calendar/</a></p><p>Its pretty nice. I think, if you look at the January calendar on my site I even publish a task.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>the integrated sunbird publishing mechanism is via webdav - so if your server is webdav enabled then you don't have to do anything special.</p><p>However, if you don't have a webdav enabled server you have to work around that.  I use a batch file that ftps my cal up and my wifes down.  Overall, its pretty simple really.  Whenever I'm done updating my sunbird calendar I just click on a shortcut and my calendar gets published to my webserver.  And my copy of my wifes gets synch'd because I download hers.  She does the same and we are always up to date with each others calendar.</p><p>I go into more detail here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frawlinson.us%2Fblog%2Findex.php%3Fp%3D143%3AS2BQfAjIhw67uKKZzkPFxBMk9ag&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rawlinson.us/blog/index.php?p=143">http://rawlinson.us/blog/in...</a></p><p>hope that helps clear up the confusion I might have caused.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, how did it go with updating your calendar from two different "locations"?</p><p>I tried <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ficalx.com%3AyfIygZ9Q5AS7IgG6mdo6CK6oGu4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="icalx.com">icalx.com</a> from two machines and it took me a while before I finally got a hang of sunbird's publishing/subscribing mechanism. I hope the next release will make this whole thing intuitive. Until then, this is what I had to do.</p><p>1) Create a local calendar with no publishing details</p><p>2) Publish a local calendar to webDAV enabled server</p><p>3) Delete the calendar you just created including its local file</p><p>4) Subscribe to remote calendar with automatic publishing checked</p><p>5) Repeat just #4 with another machine</p></div>

I'm not as experienced a programmer as others who post here, and I haven't dived very deeply into all of the technologies I'm mentioning here, but looking at an .ics file it seems almost like an XML document.
