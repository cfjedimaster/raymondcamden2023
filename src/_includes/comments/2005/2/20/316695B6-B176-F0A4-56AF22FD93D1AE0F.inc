		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the tip, Ray... I run the same combo on one machine, and I wouldn't have figured to check the AV for a "no inbox" kind of symptom.... ;-)</p><p>Would it work to set up filtering to multiple folders, so that each mailing list goes into its own folder, with the final filter sending all messages to an "other mail" kind of box which is then AV-scanned? I'm not sure yet if we can filter on Personal Address Book as well, but would something like this isolate your scanned folder from your trustworthy folders...?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Right now I've got gmail handling all my lists, which has done a LOT to slow down the surge of email to my inbox. I could actually use a "New Mail" sound now if I wanted. ;) As for what you suggested, I may give that a try. As it stands, my only real beef w/ TBird now is that the spam handling isn't quite as nice so far.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the same problem with Norton corrupting pegasus email mailfiles when it tried to remove a virus as PMail was running.</p><p>I set it to ignore the actual mail folder, but it has it's inbounc (and outbound) email proxy checker ON.  So, it's checking email as it's retrieved, before it gets into the PMail mailbox files.</p><p>That seems a reasonable compromise.</p><p>Also, I had a file-sync'd copy of the mail folder on another drive.  Norton does look at that one, so I'd get warning on file-syncing if something did slip into my mail folders.</p></div>
