		<div class="comment_text"><p>I honestly despise iTunes.  It tries to be too smart and doesn't have enough options for power users.  For instance, sometimes I want to just plug in the iPod to transfer over a CD which I just ripped, but it tries to do a full sync which takes quite awhile on the 40 GB version.  Now I have the auto-sync disabled, but it doesn't have an obvious way to do a sync on demand... so I end-up having to drag and drop whatever I want to go on the iPod rather than it doing a real sync.</p></div>
