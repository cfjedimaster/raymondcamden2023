		<div class="comment_text"><p>Not every episode of The Prisoner was a work of art but, you're right, it came close.</p><p>I liked Enterprise as a series. There were a couple of "plot device off the starboard bow, captain!" episodes (something that Voyager suffered chronically from!) but overall it was good and had interesting characters.</p><p>My favorite Trek series is still DS9 tho'...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I loved the Prisoner series except for the series finale.  It was so surreal that it made Salvadore Dali look like a realist.  While the series was always full of 60's counterculture messages, the finale was so full of symbolism that you felt like you'd just dropped a sugar cube and licked a superman stamp or two after watching it. (Not that I'd, um, condone such a thing... cough cough)</p><p>As George Carlin put it to Bette Midler in the movie Outrageous Fortune, "Man, the 60's were good to you"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm sad about this, because I really enjoyed Enterprise for the most part.  I am NOT a "Trekkie" in that I can't name episodes and such, but I've seen all the movies, and watched most of the original series, the next generation, voyager, and enterprise (I didn't like DS9)</p><p>I hope that the rights owners will allow someone else to take up the reigns.  Sci-Fi makes some cool series, and I can't imagine that Trek on SciFi would be a failure.</p><p>I've enjoyed every Trek series except DS9, and I really enjoyed the "early history" from Enterprise, tying in the movies referencing the invention of the warp engine especially, because I really enjoyed the idea of the BEGINNING of true space exploration.</p><p>It's not real but it's certainly an enjoyable fantasy, and I will miss Star Trek if it is never resurrected.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rick: I agree - I loved the history part - and the whole animosity angle with the Vulcans I thought was wonderful. It gave a whole new twist to the "history."</p><p>bob: I never watched Babylon 5, and I know that is a mistake. I've heard nothing but good things about it - but I just never had the chance.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is your new machine a Mac G5?</p><p>Babylon 5 tops Treck as far as I am concerned.  When it started it looked goofy and frivilous, but once the story arc started it became much more interesting and much darker.</p></div>
