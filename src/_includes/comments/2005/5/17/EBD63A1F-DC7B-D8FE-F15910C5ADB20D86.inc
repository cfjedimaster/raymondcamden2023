		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome!<br>  We went through a failed adoption.  In retrospect, it was probably for the best.  The birth mom finanlly realized what she was missing and got herself together.  The kids got 8 months of stability &amp; love.  The kids were old enough so that they knew who their birth mom was.<br>  I learned an **invaluable** lesson in parenting.  I'm a lot less rigid.  Just wish I figured it out while those kids were still with us.<br>  Because of that experience, I think I'm a better parent for our son, who we officially adpoted a year ago.  This little guy's truly amazing, but I'm biased!!<br>  Again, congratulations - you're all blessed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gotcha Day is a special event for my husband, my son, and me. Unlike the huge party we give for his birthday, we prefer a small celebration on his adoption anniversary. Our son knows that this is his special day, and we allow him to choose the theme. Last year it was the childrenâ€™s museum, a movie, and lunch at his favorite restaurant. Although his adoption book is always available to him, on this day in particular, we pull it out and share his adoption story and our excitement over his joining our family. He loves this part of the day. <br>&lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.umutdolu.com%2Farac-otokiralama%2F%3AfVHDKt1MIR2eIArK6qZfjiCFZdY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.umutdolu.com/arac-otokiralama/">http://www.umutdolu.com/ara...</a>"&gt;arac-otokiralama&lt;/a&gt;</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Susan, you have an interesting point of view, but we are going to have to agree to disagree. I've never heard of an adoptive parent/child being offended by the term 'Gotcha.' Obviously you have - and different people will get offended by different things. For example, I get pretty ticked when the announcer on one of my favorite shows refers to a characters 'real' father.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Susan, I'd never really of "Gotcha Day" until I came to this website sometime last year.  Since I'd heard it I'd just never used it, though.  No reason one way or the other.  But I've never thought of the term as degrading or anything, like if it was called something like, say, "Acquisition Day".  I guess the term "Gotcha!" always seemed like it was kind of playful to me.  But to each...we all have those things that just run up our spine.  Personally, mine is when someone says "Oh, he's a lucky boy!" if they find out he's adopted...to which I'll usually politely reply "We're ALL lucky."  His "luck" depends on my parenting skills that particular day ;-)  My wife &amp; I, on the other hand, are absolutely blessed to be able to share in this child's life.</p></div>
