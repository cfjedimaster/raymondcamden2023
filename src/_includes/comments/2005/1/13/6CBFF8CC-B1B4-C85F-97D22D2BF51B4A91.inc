		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recently recommended purchasing it to produce the online demos at my current employer, and we had a similar feeling when we used it. We were seriously impressed by how simple it was to build complex demos that used to take days of tedious Flash work. We probably saved the cost of the product on its first official use.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Personally I wish Marcomedia would use their own awesome products for some valuable training on their products.</p><p>Case in point. I have been trying to setup a cluster with CFMX on a single box for weeks now. Basically what I mean is I have one box, with one IP address and I'm trying to get JRun to cluster the multiple server instances of CFMX. Can't get this to work for the life of me. Tried to follow every single instructions out there: Brandon Parcell's, Macromedia's, Talking Tree's, everyone saids it's easy and the their instructions work.</p><p>Now wouldn't it be great if Macromedia used Captivate to create a presentation on how to do this and showed us all EXACTLY how it is done? I love Macromedia products but I find that most of the time (especially with CFMX and JRUN) they tell you that this can be done and don't give you the instructions on how to do it. They rely on the community to give out the information and most of the time getting anything from the community is like pulling teeth.</p><p>--- End Rant ---</p></div>
