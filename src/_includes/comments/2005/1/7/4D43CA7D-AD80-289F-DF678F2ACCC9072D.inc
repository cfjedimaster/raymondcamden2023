		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi there Raymod. I just ported your blog to BlueDragon, Linux, and Postgres (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.robrohan.com%2F%29%3AWAju5zR3mLzMrvv5dNog9ooXLfc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.robrohan.com/)">http://www.robrohan.com/)</a> - While I am pretty sure you could do with out the BD part, I'd be more than happy to send you the Postgres parts if you want them (mostly just some tweeks to blog.cfc and an addtional sql file). Let me know if you you want them (or, I guess, you can grab them from my site if you want). Thanks for making this tool.</p><p>Cheers</p></div>
