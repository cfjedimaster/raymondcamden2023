		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep - it was sarcastic. And scary at the same time. I plan on teaching my children that they can respect authority (parents, teachers, etc) and still be able to think for themselves.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I quite agree.  It's a hot topic here in Australia right now, as an arabic Australian citizen returns to Australia after being incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay for 3 years.   He was arrested by US forces in Pakistan, and accused of working with al-Quaeda.  He was sent by the US to Egypt to be interrogated in their charming manner, then flown to Cuba as the guest of the US Government.</p><p>After 3 years he's been released without charge, on the condition that the Australian government restrict his movements (something they'll have trouble doing under our constitution).</p><p>Now he's released, there is a hubbub brewing because of his alleged mistreatment by the US military, and because of the lack of spine on the part of the Australian government, who ought to have been insisting that Habib was either charged and brought to trial or released.</p><p>I think it's outrageous how the US thinks it can lecture the world about freedom and democracy, yet have all these prisoners held without trial, without even being charged, and without the protection of the Geneva Convention as prisoners of war.</p><p>In this matter, the US Military is behaving like the thugs they tell us they are pledged to eradicate.</p></div>
