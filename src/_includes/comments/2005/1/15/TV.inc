		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've gotten hooked on this over the past week. They must be showing repeats during the week or something, cuz I've seen four episodes and only one was on a Friday (yesterday). So far, it is really good, which is a relief. I was kinda thinking it'd be only so-so. Haven't seen any sex at all, btw.</p></div>
