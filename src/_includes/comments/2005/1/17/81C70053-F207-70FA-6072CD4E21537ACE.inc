		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, to make sure you keep all of the backlinks and PageRank associated with your old url you'll need to do an http 301 redirect to the new blog url.  Let me know if you need help doing this.  I'd be more than happy to help.  There's also a way to dynamically 301 users to the new url for every url on your old site as well.</p><p>Best Regards,<br>Jason Dowdell</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Makes sense.  One note though.  You'll want to tell the search engine robots to not crawl your old site anymore because you'll end up getting hit with a duplicate content penalty.  Meaning you have multiple urls pointing to the same content.  You can put this in your robots.txt file to fix that.<br>useragent: *<br>disallow: /morpheus/blog/</p><p>Then they will no longer crawl that url. Chances are  they'll keep the pages they've archived in their search results though.  Would be a good experiment either way.</p></div>
