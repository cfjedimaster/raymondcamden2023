		<div class="comment_text"><p>I haven't looked through the code yet, but I thought it was cool that if I take a hit and make 21 the game automatically advances to the dealer's turn, it doesn't make me hit "stay" first.</p><p>One nit-pick: after clicking "Ante" the game should automatically set the focus to the bet amount form field.  If you're going to set a default bet for me, go the extra step and focus on the field so all I have to do is hit enter :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One small nit, I like that it remembers my last bet amount, but if my last bet amount is more than the total I have remaining it should reduce to how much I have left.</p><p>Said differently the bet amount should default to the lower of the following two options: last bet amount or money remaining.</p><p>I also got lost far more than I won.  Partly because there is no true "push" in the rules you established, and secondly because the dealer got 21 ALOT.  Crazy combos for it too like 8,2,5,4,2 etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Small prob:  Type 'ab' into the bet field and it throws a 'this value is not numeric' error.  Any user input needs to be sanitized to be sure it is what you expect!  =)  Otherwise, I really like the background image, and the clean look-n-feel of your app, very nice!</p></div>
