		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think you should create an in case I die page that will send posts to your blog, change your home page, and so forth to say "unfortunaley I'm dead so this site will no longer be updated". Your wife isnt going to care about the websites if, god forbid that happens. Also disable comments on your blog so people wont be posting sorry to here that. Then give your wife that link. So in one shot she can do it all</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unfortunately, this has been happening.  There have been several cases involving families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afganistan.  Their families want to preserve the web site as a memorial to them.  However, because the of the privacy policies of many of the ISP's, those families cannot gain access to the site, retain the content of the site, redirect e-mail, etc.  Even with power of attorney, they have little recourse.  The bad thing is, if site fee payments are missed, or domain names not renewed, ISP going belly up, the family's memorial is lost.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought about this recently myself. The crazy thing is that the web is so young that we really haven't had to deal with it yet. Give it 20 years, and this will be a much more common occurance...there will probably be companies that specialize in gracefully closing down your "web presence" after you pass.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The problem doesn't seem to be with "web hosts" as it is with websites like Yahoo! that offer free email or other services.  For them to spend time reviewing Power of Attorney paperwork and matching it up would be an undue burden considering they provide a free service.  And they would have to give these documents more than a cursory examination or it would be an easy back-door into anybodys account.  Keep in mind that Yahoo! hosts millions of email accounts, there are probably tens of thousands of their customers that die ever year.</p></div>

I have a printed copy of a file I maintain as an attachment to each, and these documents reference the current file location on my computer and how to retrieve it.  I think there may be an opportunity to develop an application for storing these, but execution of the actual disposition or disolution of these assets is something you probably want in your will.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is is quite a simple question and John hit right on it.</p><p>In your will, put a list of all the websites that you maintain. Next to each list the name or the community that you want to give that site to. Make sure that you also list the hosting provider that these sites are hosted with. Have a blank document stating the name of the site, the new person / community that now owns the site and statements giving them full control over the accounts and everything else they would need to take control over the sites.</p><p>As for your peronsal sites. List thoughs as well with instructions for your wife to call the hosting provider and take them down.</p></div>

I view it as an on going auto-biography. So that my kids and generations beyond have information into their past. Like I know only basic stuff about my grandparents. And know VERY LITTLE of my grandparents. And I want to know more.</p><p>So my BCP (Blog Continuity Plan) - is that if I croak... my will pretty  much needs to either have someone take over my hosting account, or basically just prepay the webhosting company a few decades worth of payments. :)</p></div>

One stood out, where i hit a jump in bushland behind my house, didn't pick my landing right and came off... no biggy, except i flipped the bike and landed chest first on the ground...right next to a jaggered stump... basically 6 inches to the left, and i'd have a wooden piercing that was  fatal.. on the ride back home i had one of those "what if i died then, thoughts" and the domain did come up.</p></div>

This includes everything from my ebay and paypal account to the CFXtras and Logware backups. The DB access, phone numbers of companies and even the location of the backed up files are specified. Basically, it could be handled off to a nerd and their is a enough info to have everything shut down or handed off.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ben -</p><p>You may want to check with your bank and attorney about putting things in a Safe Deposit box for use after your demise.  If you do expire the contents of your safe deposit box are usually 'sealed' until the court/Executor of your will determine the deposition of your wordly possessions.  Kind of like the ultimate Catch-22, your final instructions (will, insurance policies, what to do with my website and all of the computers and whatever) are locked away in a safe deposit box until your final instructions can be determined which are in the locked box that can't be opened and so on and so on.  Check with your family attorney for specifics.</p></div>
