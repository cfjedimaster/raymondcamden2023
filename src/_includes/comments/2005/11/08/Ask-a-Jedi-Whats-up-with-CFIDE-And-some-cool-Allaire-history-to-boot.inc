		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, that's what a few of our customers told us, anyway, and so we removed it fomr the next CF5 Beta rather than potentially offend and.or alienate customers who might be sensitive to it.</p><p>The CF team thought it was kinda cool since one of the themes of CF5 was performance and scalability (vs CF 4.5), but hey... :)</p><p>Damon</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's kinda wild... I've never spent much time cruising thru the Administrator folders. See what I've been missing? All those beautious NEO and MX images? Classic!</p><p>Aside from the one left in the classes folder, there aren't any Allaire images though. Beyond that, however, I'm amazed at the number of references to Allaire still in there... at least in the encrypted pages everything starts with a reference to Allaire. In /CFIDE/scripts/wddx.js is Simeon Simeonov's old Allaire email address right next to "Copyright Macromedia."</p><p>Head over to /CFIDE/wizards/common/_logintowizard.cfm and you'll find a classic CFMX 6.0 login page (doesn't go anywhere, but it does render correctly).</p><p>There's all kinds of neat stuff in there...</p><p>Laterz,<br>J</p></div>
