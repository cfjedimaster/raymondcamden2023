The issue we are having with the Cooper is that the trunk is not being closed properly. The car thinks the trunk is open and turns the light on which drains the battery. I'm going to call the dealer today and see where i can bring it. (The dealer is in Baton Rouge, and I don't want to drive all the way there.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yep - we had the same problem. We took it to the dealer and they fixed it for us under the warranty.</p><p>The silver is really nice! That is one of our favorite colors for a Mini (ours is black over yellow).</p><p>The nearest dealer is a bit of a drive for us as well (about two hours).</p></div>
