		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Peter! I haven't actually played it yet, but hope to this weekend. I'm mostly better. Still have a bit of snot (I know, too much info), but feeling much better. About 80% better. :)</p><p>The post for the first entry is almost done and will hopefully be online in the next hour or so.</p></div>
