		<div class="comment_text"><p>that would be very cool (seeing how a 'pro' would do it).  actually...the more pros who'd be willing to pitch in, the better (just like us intermediate guys, the pros can vary widely on their approaches.  would be interesting to see the differences in approach there).</p><p>Reading blogs, going to CFUGs/Conferences etc, reading books...that's all good.  But sometimes to really grasp what somebody's trying to teach/explain, it sometimes helps to see a (simple) full-blown app (something like a blog or a forum might be a little complex when it comes to trying to learn concepts...but something simple like the blackjack app should be easy enough to decipher what's going on).</p><p>I'd love to put my code next to some of the 'ninjas' out there and see how I could do things differently (and theorteically more effectively...or just...better) :)</p></div>
