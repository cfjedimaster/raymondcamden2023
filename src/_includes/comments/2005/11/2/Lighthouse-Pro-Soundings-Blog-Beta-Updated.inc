		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>I have just checked new BlogCFC beta and here are some notes.</p><p>- MySQL script does not work as I expected for me. I use Navicat 2005 as MySQL manager and it could not get database with current script. I need to delete lines such as "/*!40101 SET NAMES utf8 */;" in order to get expected script run. I think this is a compatibility problem for clients softwares.<br>- Unicode problem for MySQL script has been resolved.<br>- There are still Unicode problems on RSS feeds. Unicode chars are like ????. This is really important!<br>- I have just clicked link for one of the category and I got following error.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>We're sorry, but an error has occured while processing your request.<br>An error occured while processing a document.
