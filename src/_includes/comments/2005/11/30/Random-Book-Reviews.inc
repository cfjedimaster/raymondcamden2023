		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK Ray, have you read any Gene Wolfe? If you have or know anybody that has you have probably hear raves about his 5-volume "Book of the New Sun" starting with Shadow of the Torturer (no this is not your pointy haired boss's influence). This was a seminal work in the SF genre and I believe one of the finest SF works ever... well now Gene has done it again with a two-volume series called "Wizard Knight" in which Gene conquers the world of Faerie. This book has between its cover a world of such color and magic, you wouldn't believe... truly a golden book. (Of course if you read and hated Book of the New Sun then you'd probably hate this book too.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually have both of the Wizard books. I've read the first one. To be honest... I wasn't too happy with the book. It was definitely _unique_, and I'll give it props for that, but I just wasn't terribly happy with it, and I'm in no big rush to read part 2. (Although I will - to see how things turn out.)</p></div>
