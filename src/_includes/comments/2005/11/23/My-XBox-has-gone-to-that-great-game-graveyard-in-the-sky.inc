		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmmmm . . . if we start hearing that more XBoxes are dying the day after the XBox360 lauches, well let's just hope they don't go all "I, Robot" on us. :)</p><p>Instead of hooking the XBox HD up to your motherboard, you can pickup external USB/FW HD enclosures for around $15 at Fry's or CompUSA. Just pop in the IDE drive, plug it into the USB or Firewire port and Windows should recognize it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So - this is interesting. I called XBox customer support. The guy I spoke to said today was -crazy- because of the XBox 360, and that no one at his place had gotten any training yet for the 360.</p><p>Anyway - I was able to finally browse to the HD, and it said it had 0 blocks. Definitely a HD crash. It's 80 bucks plus shipping to fix it. If shipping is &lt; 20 bucks, it is still cheaper than a used machine.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You might want to wait a few days and see if used Xboxes start hitting eBay after their owners buy a 360.  I'm sure there are a ton of people like me that bought the Xbox for only a handful of games in the first place, all of which are playable on the 360 in emulation mode.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I hope I'm not being to straight forward but, can I have it?</p><p>I'll pay the shipping. I guess it never hurts to ask.</p><p>I love to tinker with stuff.</p><p>Oh, FYI I went to the local GameStop here in San Antonio, TX and they told me they had 75 preorders and only received 11. Thanks to Bill's change from North America to the a world wide release. needless to say many people are quoting COSTANZA, "George is getting upset!"...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the exact same problem a month or so back. It was a secondhand machine I bought off eBay (cheapcheap!) so I had no warranty options.</p><p>I ended up replacing the HD myself through various not-so-legit means (which were surprisingly easy) and haven't had a problem since.</p><p>As Seth mentioned tho, you will probably be able to pick them up off eBay by the truckload over the next few months.</p></div>
