		<div class="comment_text"><p>Blaine<br>I have been using Tortoise CVS and Tortoise SVN for a while now and becuase of their windows explorer integration you can use them from "within" pretty much any application.</p><p>For instance, I mostly code in Editplus (a notepad replacement) and whenever I need to check-in/out/commit a file I just pop open the "Open File Dialog" and I can right click on the file(s) I need to make a change to, use the Tortoise menu option, and everything happens right there.  I then close the open file dialog and go right back to what I was editing.</p><p>I'm sure this same method would work fine in Dreamweaver.</p><p>As others have said SVN is pretty easy to setup.  I would recommend SVN over CVS in the long run becuase it supports a few featuers CVS doesn't (such as file renaming and having that propogate into the version history).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We also use SourceOffSite/VSS because it integrates well with Homesite+, which, because it also supports deploying one or more files via RDS or FTP, has been our preferred IDE.  But since it's been all but abandoned we have begun to look at CFEclipse.  And its support for CVS and Subversion has caused us to begin looking at those solutions.  Like a lot of people that have been left in a lurch by MM's akward handling of us CFStudio/Homesite+ folk, we're looking for two fundamental things in our IDE.  Integrated source control and remote deployment.  It's widely known that MM is working on RDS for CFEclipse and we're basically waiting to see if this support the same sort of deploymnet capabilities that we are used to in Homesite+.  Once that piece falls into place I think we'll jump to a CFEclipse and Subversion solution.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been using Subversion (SVN) with Eclipse / Dreamweaver and Trac (actually added Windows Trac setup instructions to their Wiki).  A basic Subversion install is very easy. What initially overwhelms people is installing other software to support various setups (Python, Apache, etc...) that said, SVN can connect to its repository via HTTP, File://, SVN:// . typically you use HTTP or File.</p><p>Personally using Apache and doing HTTP is the best. If anybody has questions or would like a copy of an Apache config file more than happy to help. The listed link for 30min setup is good though is limited. As FYI in Dreamweaver you will used WebDav, and it works, but you lose the commenting feature of SVN that you get in the Eclipse plugin and TortoiseSVN. Also, HIGHLY RECOMMEND having alternate methods of check in/out of SVN. That is install Tortoise as backup to Eclipse plugin and DW Webdav.</p><p>You can contact me at kmarino"do not spam"<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fattach.net%3AuOOqPLWcsfPBTA2B1_ZBb0cTKEs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="attach.net">attach.net</a> (ya know what to replace :) )</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For anyone using CVS or SVN and the related tortoise product I would recommend a look at Eclipse because the built in CVS integration is very sweet! CVS is built right into eclipse (that is what we use) and I believe SVN is a plugin.  For example you can right click any source file and select 'compare with..' and then choose a previous version from the repository and display a diff of the current file and the previous one on screen. You can visually see and tags or branches that exist on a project, and you can see the change history for your current file showing who committed the change, the date and the comment they entered, in my view this removes the need to clutter the source file itself with this info. SVN I think can be seen as CVS's smarter younger brother. It extends and improves on CVS's solid features.</p></div>
