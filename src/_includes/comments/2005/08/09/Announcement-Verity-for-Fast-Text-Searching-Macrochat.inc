		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, german language pack is installed and we did use german locale when creating the collection.</p><p>we tried also several things with pageencoding on the resultspage, but it seems the problem is with verity on Suse Enterprise ( I don't know about other Linux distributions).</p><p>CF7 on WinServer is ok.<br>CF6 on same SuseLinux is also ok.</p><p>AFAIK verity changed on cf7 to unicode, correct me if I am wrong.</p></div>
