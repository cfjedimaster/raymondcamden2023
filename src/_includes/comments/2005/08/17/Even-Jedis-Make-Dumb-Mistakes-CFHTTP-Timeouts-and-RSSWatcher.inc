		<div class="comment_text"><p>Each HTTP call sounds like a good candidate to fire off via the Event Gateway (provided you have an MX 7 box and so forth)? I would imagine it would cut the 3 minutes down to maybe 20 seconds or even less.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I made a major cfhttp boo-boo last week, I forgot that cfhttpparam type="formfield" used the cfhttp method="" option to decide how the data was submitted whereas for some reason I was fixated on it sending everything via POST.  Naturally enough it didn't work and I wasted several hours of my and others' time.  GAH!</p><p>Damien</p></div>
