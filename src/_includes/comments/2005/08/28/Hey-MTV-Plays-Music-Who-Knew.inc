		<div class="comment_text"><p>120 Minutes introduced me to half of the cool music I listened to in high school. And when they did non-music stuff back then, it was good. Anyone remember The Maxx, Liquid TV, and The Real World (Season 1) before it was about some spoiled brats getting drunk and sleeping with each other?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Same here. There were many bands I "learned" about from 120 minutes, and you are right, the non-music shows were good - when they were kept to a minimum.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I must admit that I don't actually have cable/satellite TV so I'm a little behind the scene, but last I checked (at my inlaws) Fuse was still mostly music-based.  MTV2 I can't vouch for, its been a while since I've watched it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like your statements about MTV.  I basically think MTV is a big joke these days.  It is absolutley ridiculous that it should even be refered to as MTV.  Although they may be going along with the idea of opposites.  Like when you call a big guy "Tiny".  And I tell you what I am bitter about it and I am getting somewhat old oh well.  I do think the prgrams they show could actually suck the intelligence right out of you.  Anyways thanks for letting me vent here since I couldn't find a comment section on the MTV website.</p></div>
