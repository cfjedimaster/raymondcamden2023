		<div class="comment_text"><p>Join the club... our power over here in Campbell, CA went out and there wasn't even a storm. when the power came back on my main Active Directory/Exchange server was completely dead (as in lifeless). I went down to the local electronics store (Fry's) and bought a $40 power supply, got it home and it had the wrong connector for the motherboard! I brought the old one with me on my second trip and got one for $60 with the correct connector and I'm back up... I was about ready to just but a whole new set of hardware... lesson for the day... backup your valuable projects every day.</p></div>
