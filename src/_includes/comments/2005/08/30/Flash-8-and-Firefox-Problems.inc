		<div class="comment_text"><p>i doubt if this one is b'cos of player 8, as I was experiencing it even with 7; this tip here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffusion94.org%2Farchives%2F2005%2F07%2Ffirefox_memory.html%3ApKXVN677pkBbFukI0M56oHVlQTI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/07/firefox_memory.html">http://fusion94.org/archive...</a>, as well as many others, point to explicitly setting the browser cache limit--that solved it for me</p><p>hth, eokyere</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have also had this problem and do not have Flash 8 yet...but having done alot of Flash work lately I was able to become relatively sure it was related to Flash player as it was the only common element in every crash. It seems to happen most often when I click around to another page or refresh quickly before the movie has fully loaded.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My firefox freezes every time I try to open a site that uses flash (for example uses flash for loggins, or uploads of pictures, etc).<br>I tried to do the memory leak thingy, but it didn't work. I've checked for AdBlock, as people say that is the cause, but can't find that I have it (at least it's not where it's said to be, and I can't find it anywhere)</p><p>Any ideas?</p></div>
