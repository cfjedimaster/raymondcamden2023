Outta curiousity, did you go through an adoption agency from Korea?</p><p>My cousins (2 of 'em) and I are also adopted from South Korea.. adoptions seems to be pretty big in our family and I'm all for it when I find others either who are adopted or adopting kids.  I think that's awesome!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>RE: Holt, I'm not sure.  I believe it was on the Korean side.. but I could be wrong.  I'll have to check - just cuz now I'm curious. I looked at their website briefly..  man, I was an expensive kid. :)</p><p>Anyways, yep.. been using CF for about 6yrs now.  Trying to get Flex and AIR in here!</p><p>I'm so happy with the CFFeed tag.. been doing it the long way, and even if it's not totally perfect yet.. it's still nice to have!</p></div>
