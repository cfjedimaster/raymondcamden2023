		<div class="comment_text"><p>We nice survey application.  Nice to see one in ColdFusion using the new built-in reporting.  However, I keep having a problem logging into the admin section.  I did get it to work for a short period of time and created a nice little survey and was able to complete it and use all the features in admin section.  However after I turned debugging off it doesn't let me in anymore.  I haven't changed the settings.ini file and it still doesn't work.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p>Chad Hughes</p></div>

Try Firefox and I bet it'll work. There's a quick fix on the forum to get IE to work but it stops FF. The more feedback we can give Ray the better chance we have of him finding that little gremlin :-)</p></div>
