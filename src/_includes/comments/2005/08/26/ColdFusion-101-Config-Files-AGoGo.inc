		<div class="comment_text"><p>I forgot to include the "funny OT story." Back in college I was in film class, watching a movie. I believe it was "The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance", with John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart. At one point in the film, if I remember right, John Wayne's character was eating steak, drinking liquor, and smoking. He then tells Stewart's character something along the lines of "What you need is a hand gun!"</p><p>I bust out laughing. Something about _all_ those vices at once just made me loose my mind.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You may want to expand this article to deal a little more with the live, dev, staging sections.  For instance, since all of your settings are in the .ini file  - how does a beginner identify which section of settings they want.. do they set a variable in the application.[cfm|cfc] file?  Do they just hard code it at the line they are reading the settings at?  Do they set up some kind of dynamic evaluation thing based on server ip to know which section to grab? I'm sure there are a bunch of different options as well.  Which do you use and why?</p><p>While there might not be a "best practice" for this adding that little nugget of information would probably be very beneficial considering the target audience.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>One thing I notice people often miss with this approach is that, potentially, someone could access the contents of your .ini file via their browser if they guessed the right url. To avoid this security risk, I call the file something like "config.cfm" with the same contents as a typical .ini file; the difference is that the first line of the file is CFABORT ;)</p><p>As to whether to use an xml file for config values, I usually find the .ini file approach faster, but I'd love to see a follow-up article that would convince me other wise!</p><p>My $0.04</p><p>Cheers,<br>Oliver</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jeff, I never said it was -best- per se, just one way. Now, I can think of some good reasons. First off - the actual DSN is normally stored in the config file. Obviously you can't talk to a db until you have the dsn info. I'll also put the mapping info in a config file as well. There is no reason why not to use both either. For example, our Element product, a CMS, uses a mix of both. The config file is normally stuff only we mess with, and the Settings stuff is stuff that the client changes. CF provides many ways of solving the problem. :)</p></div>

Nathan said that a file was a best practice, and my question was intended to be directed at him.</p><p> And yes, you need the dsn before you can access the database.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>&gt;  Why do you think storing it in a file is best practice over a database?</p><p>Jeff, I guess there are a number of reasons but I don't want to push what works for me down your throat. For my applications, I keep what I consider "settings" in the database. Settings are user configurable, easily accessible, and change frequently. When I deploy an application, or setup a new environment, I edit the configuration file. I store "fail safe" parameters in that file. This lets the application know who to email in the event an exception is thrown, if I want tracing, or turn caching on or off, etc. Other developers can easily view, understand, and modify those core settings. Frameworks set a pretty good standard, and both Mach-II and Fusebox use configuration files. Neither require you to setup a database to store the configuration.</p></div>
