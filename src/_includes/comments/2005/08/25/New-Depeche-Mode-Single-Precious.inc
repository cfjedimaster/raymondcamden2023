		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got to see DM in Sunnyvale, CA in 1990 during their 'Violator' tour.  It was a very impressive show.  Nothing like hanging out with 50,000 fans at an outdoor arena singing 'Master and Servant'.  I once owned all of their albums (some on tape, the early 80s stuff), but I've lost most of them.  The only CDs I have left are '101' and 'Violator'.  I'll definitely have to check out the new release.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>niice.<br>the track was leaked on the net weeks ago... but yes it's damn good. i've had it on repeat for days now... <br>their music video was also leaked but they managed to remove it from the web as soon as it hit. i wonder if they've released that yet?</p><p>anyway, i've seen them live as well during their EXCITER tour in Toronto, which was excellent. i was so impressed at how great they sound live. they're got a new north american tour starting this fall, so that'll be something to look forward to! <br>cheers!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree this new single is AWESOME.  I too have thought the last few albums have been a little lack luster.  Although I did enjoy Ultra alot.  But this new single is really well done.  I can't wait to see them for my 8th show.. hehe</p></div>
