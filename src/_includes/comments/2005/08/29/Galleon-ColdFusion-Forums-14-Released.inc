		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wonderful. Thank you! As far as future features, you mentioned  planning to add subscriptions, so a user can subscribe to a conference, forum, or thread.</p><p>Presuming I have an updated version of Galleon and the subscriptions at various levels hasn't been addressed yet, this would be my suggestion. Thanks again!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No code colouring yet. I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to do it. I mean I know how to color code. I'm not sure how the UI will work. I think the Macromedia forums have a popup or an attachment for you to paste code into, so I'm thinking something like that. I'll look into it when I add file attachments to Galleon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Prefixing tables is kind of kewl but it is easier to virtualize a data model by using the table owner rather than prefixing tables.  Now only are there no collisions or fewer collisions of the namespace kind but one can more easily leverage multiple copies of the same tables using the table owner which from SQL Server 2000's viewpoint is nothing but a string - the table owner does not need to have an existing login in order for this to work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When yo usay private forums, do you mean forums only available to certain people? I wasn't planning on doing it. Galleon has 'groups', but just 3 of them, and mainly meant to represent their role in the app.</p><p>Of course, you could install a second Galleon and put it behind some additional security.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Had to create an Oracle port of the database creation script to try it out on our server here. (You're welcome to the table creation script if at all interested, btw). Only issue I had was with the column named 'group' in the galleon_groups table---Oracle won't allow that name, as it's a reserved word. The queries are going to need some tweaking to account for Oracle, but other than that, it's a pretty straightforward port.</p></div>
