		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks. You can use the onError stuff as explained there without the remoting as another means to accomplish what the person was asking. The nice thing is that you can combine your custom validation with the built-in errors. I also agree that the remoting stuff is a bit of a risk...but it sure is cool.</p></div>
