They’re trying to help!</p><p>2) Why the hell isn’t the national guard driving in there like we did into Bagdhad?  It sounds like we need to take *control* of the city again!</p><p>3) Why the hell are people just sitting there, getting ready to die?!</p><p>WALK!!! If busses can drive in, you can walk out!  If it's as bad as they say it is at the Superdome, you can’t get much worse.  Don't just wait to die!  Go!  Act!  Do something!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Doug,</p><p>1) People are stupid alright</p><p>2) Because most of the national guard is currently in Irak? To give them a break though, preparation simply takes time.</p><p>3) You are asking a single mother with 4 kids or old people (possibly in wheelchairs) to walk miles and miles out of town? They have no water, no food and would probably die on their way out because of that. Their best chance was and still is to be in a central location where some sort of relief effort can collect and help them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, sorry.  I’m frustrated.  I can’t stand watching this stuff unfolding on the news.  I agree that the old people and the fragile people shouldn’t try to walk miles in the heat down there.  Really, I do.</p><p>Not being there, there’s probably something I don’t know or understand.  However, I have a two year old son.  If he and I were there, at the super dome, I think I’d give walking a chance.  I think my wife might too.</p><p>Yes, it would be extremely hard.  Yes, you might die.  But, if you could get out of downtown you might be able to find a more inhabitable area.  You might find food and water.</p><p>I can’t imagine, in those circumstances, giving up control and just hoping for the sake of hope that things don’t get worse.</p><p>Regarding #2, you’re right.  I’m frustrated.  You can’t just walk the national guard into a city and hope to change anything.  It would probably make things worse.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree that we should have been on this before it even took place. I think we all agree on that one... But, I think its insulting and completely inappropriate to critique the decisions that people have made in that situation. Its a horrible thing that has happened, yet I find it more troubling that for so many of us, our first response is to assume that we would act so differently in such a situation.</p><p>Who knows maybe you would up and just walk away. Maybe I would too. But I'm going to assume that all the people enduring this situation probably have a better perspective. It is tough though, I have to pay $3.20 a gallon for gas, I have to drive all the way to the store to buy food and water, with the price of heating oil I should probably only take 10 minute showers , and I'm going to try to save some money by nudging my A/C up to 73. Even though, I think I'll assume that they are still in a better position to make those kinds of decisions.</p><p>Maybe I'm alone on this one, but that attitude is disrespectful and grinds me pretty bad.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The thing is people in the rest of the coutry need to realize is that what they see mostly of N.O. is the glitz and charm of the French Quarter ,but this is probably the poorest of the large metropolitan areas in the US. What you are seeing now is people who have been pretty well neglected for a while feeling like in their time of need, they are once again being neglected and are basically resorting to primal survival techniques, just with modern weapons. I agree it shouldn't have taken more than about 30 minutes after the levees broke to call up the needed National Guard units. The fact it took almost 48 hours is alarming.</p></div>
