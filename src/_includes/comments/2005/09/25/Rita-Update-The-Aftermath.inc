		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've evacuated for every Florida storm that looked like it might come close.  You were not even in the strong side of the storm and you were on the outside bands of Rita.  But I've stayed for a "Tropical Storm" that was just below Hurricane" status.  Never again.</p><p>Once you got through one storm like this in the dark... you never want to repeat it.  I can relate to your nervousness.  Which is why I evacuated for Ivan, Dennis and Katrina.  Because even when you don't get the eye of the storm, the wind/rain/noises/loss of power, will scare the hell outta ya.</p><p>I can understand your staying because it was quite obvious that the storm was going to miss houston and only the weak western side would hit you.  But if it were me I'd have been outta there because I've done this before.  There are a billion reasons why you don't want to weather it out and only a few reasons why it makes sense to stay.</p><p>Next time you'll evaluate things differently having experienced what you did.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond, my misjudgement.  Even though you identified where you were somehow when I was typing I was envisioning houston on a map.  You definitely had it bad in that north east wrath.  A total brain fart while I was typing the message to you.</p><p>The tropical storm that shook me up blew out the power and then the windows on the one side of the house were shaking and buckling like crazy.  I was sure one was going to blow out.</p><p>The whole reason I typed the above was because I can relate.  "Been there, done that"... and I don't want to do it again.  It's no fun once you've been through it once.</p><p>Joe, his reponse conveyed that already.  I was simply relating to the experience he went through.  I can relate 100%.  I certainly didn't think or intend for my comments to be offensive.  Obviously you thought my relating to Raymond was offensive???</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad to see you are all safe.  My wife &amp; I went through Hurricane Charley last year with our then 8-month-old son who had a bad cold at the time so we know all about what you went through.  We actually had to leave our house after charley had passed over, around 10pm, and the devastation was unreal - as the cliche goes it was like something out of a movie; unfortunately though we didn't think of taking our camera so we don't have any evidence of what we saw, just anecdotes.  Again, glad to see you and your family are all safe.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad you're safe but I do have to ask: hurricanes happen most every year. We're in the middle of a likely ten year cycle so there's more bad storms to come. Why do you live somewhere where you know you'll have to put up with this most years? Michael talked about evacuating for every major storm... once would be more than enough for me! Sheesh, I'd be off to live somewhere else in a heartbeat!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, well, _many_ places have dangers. I grew up in St. Louis and every summer we had to go hide in the basement from tornados. CA has earthquakes. In Virginia we also had hurricanes, but a bit more rare. Something else to remember, this storm turned. We were on the very edge of the projected path until the last minute. I definitely would have left had I known it was going to change course like it did.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Two years back we got hit by a hurricane in Northern Virginia.  I spent the day before digging a water draining trench thirty feet long across my backyard so the downslope wash wouldn't flood my basement.   I was ever so grateful for being told by my doctor several years earlier that I had to start working out or would have to face type two diabeties.  Anyway, the trees around the hosue swayed and dumped small branches everywhere.  The following three days we were out of power, but it being September the weather was glorious.  We got to know our neighbors, and the street helped each other to clean up.  When the power finally came on, I was almost sad.</p></div>
