		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - to kill all the weeds (and unfortuantely, any other plants) in the 'bed', try using RoundUp.</p><p>I have used it before, and typically, you can replant or reseed after 2-3 weeks.</p><p>For a more organic solution, you could try using vinegar.  Not the kind you find in the grocery store.  There are varieties out there for weed control that have higher concentrations of acetic acid (10, 15 or 20% - Household vingar has 5%).  I have had success using this for controlling weeds in an existing flower bed.</p><p>However, when I need to clear an area to plant seed, or create a flowwer bed, I tend to use RoundUp, simply because it is quicker and more effetive.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For your battery, if Dell already has a record of you calling to complain within the original period, they *might* honour that date.  For the interests of customer service, they should, but it's unkown. In my experience, Dell is good at providing good service for the original sale, but is bad at anything after-sale, repair or supplying replacement parts at reasonable prices.</p><p>Hopefully you bought the battery with a decent credit card.  You always have the option of having the credit card company issue a stop-payment, which would probably make Dell react faster to fix the problem (Dell's costs of dealing with a stop payment would exceed the cost of the battery).  Some credit cards auto extend warranty protection, but I think all will stop-payment for a product/dservice that was not supplied and/or did not work.  If you get the card company involved, you keep your money, they deal with Dell, and your problem is fixed quick!  Or tell Dell this is what you plan to do and it might get a fix quicker too.</p><p>Good luck.</p></div>
