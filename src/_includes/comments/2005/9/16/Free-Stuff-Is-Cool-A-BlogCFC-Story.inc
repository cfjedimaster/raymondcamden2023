		<div class="comment_text"><p>This has happened to me.  I recently had someone pay me to do some drastic customizations to CFFM.  And I once got paid to customize my CF_AMAZON tag ages and ages ago.  So even though I've open-sourced some of my projects (cffm, blogcfm, etc), I've gotten some financial benefit too.</p></div>
