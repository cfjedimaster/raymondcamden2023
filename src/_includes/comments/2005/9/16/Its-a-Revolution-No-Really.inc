		<div class="comment_text"><p>Some electronics should converge and some shouldn't.  I agree that a gaming console is for gaming.  IMO, What Nintendo still has going for it is the game library.  Super Mario just turned 20!  Monday is the day we can buy GameBoy Micro.  There are 700 titles that it will play.  My daughter wants one and I am going to have a hard time waiting for a valid reason to buy it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know about the library. I was into Mario and Zelda - but the latest editions of them were not nearly enough to make me want to buy a Cube. The only thing that came close was Rogue Squadron. I've heard that Nintendo has said if they DO leave the console market, they will NOT license their properties.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>oh c'mon. nintendo is trying to introduce something new to the mix. remember: the joystick is a remnant from the days when games were mostly 2d. the average game nowadays has a 3d engin as a basic requirement, and navigating through a 3d environment with tools designed for 2d does not always work, now does it?</p><p>i reckon wait till the games come out, and try it 1st before you start yapping on about something you haven't thought all the way through!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh come on now, I do think I'm allowed to comment, if for no other reason than that I've been a video game player for over 20 years. ;) We shall see, though. Nintendo has been losing in the console race lately and I do not believe that is going to change.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The one very intriguing aspect of the new controller was how it works with first person shooters.  I've always HATED FPS games on consoles because of their limited precise movement capabilities compared to the usual mouse-keyboard combo.  The new controller allows users to control movement using the joystick (like WASD on computer games), and the right controller to control look (the mouse on computer games).  That alone is a HUGE upgrade to games.</p><p>Let's not forget, too, that the controller allows accessories as well.  I'd imagine that we'll be able to get "standard" controllers by simply plugging them into the new controller.</p><p>Paradigm shifts excite me.  This is one.  We need companies like Nintendo and Apple to challenge the stagnance of Microsoft and Sony...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok, so here is a followup question. Can anyone point out another "revolution" in the history of video games that was successful? I mean, essentially, my XBOX is the same setup as my Atari 2600, just more powerful, and I'm fine with that.</p><p>Maybe the 'handheld' platform is a revolution, but to me it is just one more platform.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agree with Jonathan.  From reading the article, it looks to me like this controller has all the same funcitonality as standard console controllers, but it does it a bit differently.  And they things Nintendo has added are a move forward, IMO.</p><p>As far as MS/Sony vs. Nintendo, Nintendo was overpowered by...power.  Its that simple.  Nintendo is a small, single market company.  They can't afford to pour millions into an unprofitable venture like Sony and Microsoft did.  In the old days, the console makers were just that.  Console makers.  Microsoft's bread and butter is PC software.  They have YET to make a dime on the XBox, but their goal isn't profitability.  Its taking over a market to further their goals in the living room.  The same with Sony.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I concur.  IMO, Nintendo had a firm grip on a market - the under 18 market.  They should focus completely on that market and stop trying to come up with a new "gimmick" to creep into the over 18 market.  Nobody knew what would happen to us gamers once we got into our 20's and 30's - they didn't think we'd still be gamers, but we are - and Sony and Microsoft are doing there best to serve our needs.  The biggest mistake Nintendo ever made was when they backed out of the deal to produce the original Play Station (yes, it was two words back then).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure if we've had a true paradigm shift in gaming yet.  I'd almost say that the current controller configuration was a shift instituted by the SuperNintendo, but it's more a dramatic evolution.</p><p>I look at this as shift more like PC games realizing a mouse/keyboard combo makes for good gaming--in addition to joysticks.  Here we see something that isn't necessarily whiz-bang new, but very new to games. And as an addition to the usual cramped PS2 controller, we can have something rather more dynamic.</p><p>I'm still excited. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To those who doubt Nintendo's ability to introduce new concepts to gaming, just look at their history. They introduced the d-pad, they added L and R shoulder buttons, they were the first with analog control sticks (though the PS1's dual shock beat it to the shelves in the US market), they had the first controller-vibration, and they had the first first-party wireless controller (and the first one that really worked well).</p><p>As for Nintendo's place in the market, yes, they do indeed sell fewer home console units worldwide than their major competitors (although in Japan the X-box is essentially a big joke), however they remain a more profitable company.  Take a look at this article to understand why Nintendo works the way it does.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lostgarden.com%2F2005%2F09%2Fnintendos-genre-innovation-strategy.html%3AxAacKCFl2yf8YaGdAmCQMIYcOA0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.lostgarden.com/2005/09/nintendos-genre-innovation-strategy.html">http://www.lostgarden.com/2...</a></p><p>Now as for the idea of them giving up on the 'gamer' audience..  I think they're trying to bring in a completely new demographic, but it certainly allows for current players to enjoy it as well.  I think you'll see some very original games come out for this system, games which you won't find on anything else.  The publishers out there to make a quick buck will pass it over without a second thought, but the developers looking for fresh concepts and innovative design will flock to it.</p><p>In response to your question about other 'revolutionary' changes in video games, how about the advent of 3D?  The introduction of analog control?  Internet play in PC gaming? (I count that before I count X-box Live) It doesn't sound like much, but these things have truly changed the way we play games.  The industry as it stands is stagnating.  Yes MGS4 will look amazing, yes the 360 will probably eat the Rev's display capabilies for breakfast, but in the end it's all just more of the same.  It seems like many games these days are simply sequels to sequels where not a whole lot is changed.  Perhaps the Revolution will give us something fresh.</p></div>

"We want our games to be for anyone from five to 95 years-old," he said. "We disagree with people who say, 'Nintendo is for kids, Sony is for adults.'"</p><p>Speaking about Revolution, Miyamoto reiterated the Big N's hope that entire families will play with the machine. "Most people think videogames are all about a child staring at a TV with a joystick in his hands. I don't. They should belong to the entire family. I want entire families to play together. That was the concept behind Revolution."</p><p>Asked what he thought videogames would be like in the future, Miyamoto suggested removing what has always been a key ingredient for the medium: televisions. "It's convenient to make games that are played on TVs," he said. "But I always wanted to have a custom-sized screen that wasn't the typical four-cornered cathode-ray-tube TV. I've always thought that games would eventually break free of the confines of a TV screen to fill an entire room. But I would rather not say anything more about that."</p><p>Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but we can only speculate that because Miyamoto does not want to elaborate on the subject, he has created a machine that turns rooms into videogames, hovers, and enables time travel. Let the message boards implode.</p></div>
