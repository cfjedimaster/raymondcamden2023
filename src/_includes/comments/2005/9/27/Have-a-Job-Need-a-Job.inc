		<div class="comment_text"><p>With the huge influx of ColdFusion jobs, an additional resource is always appreciated. For those who are interested in the CF-Jobs list, it's at:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houseoffusion.com%2Fcf_lists%2Fthreads.cfm%2F13%3AxA7rxP1TTkrkkq4iR3dPhZaer4M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.houseoffusion.com/cf_lists/threads.cfm/13">http://www.houseoffusion.co...</a></p><p>That being said, I'm hearing a call for CF programmers from all corners. If you know CF and need a job, definitely check out Raymond's forum, the CF-Jobs list, Monster and all the other resources. It's a good time to know ColdFusion again. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We recently had to get a cf coder for our company and posted to the houseoffusion list which got us exactly 0 applicants. It seems houseoffusion is very US oriented and not that good for europeans.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is news to our european members. On the other hand, the jobs list only goes to people who sign up for it and if they all happen to be americans....</p><p>What job board/list did get you a result?</p></div>
