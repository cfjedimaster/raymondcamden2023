		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had 18 (or so) calls to HP before the finally agreed to refund my "express service" package.  ( The package guarnateed me a 3 business day turn-around for repairs, yet when I needed it, it took them over two weeks).</p><p> I made another half dozen calls, yet still no sign of the refund.  I gave up eventually, deciding that it was better to devote my time to clients.</p><p> I wish there was a place I could buy a computer that had good service.  ( I've had equally bad luck w/ Dell, Gateway, and HP)</p><p>:grumbles:</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You know,...  Not being sarcastic or anything, but I've used Dell at work for many purchases and have never had a problem orders, shipments or replacements. But then again, I think it's only because I'm a business customer and I have my own Rep.  In my opinion,  Dell doesn't give a flip about the little guy. Sad to say, but you see this more often then not.  Again, this is just my opinion.</p><p>Glad to hear all is well with the force again.</p><p>Cheers</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>You call yourself a techie and still are using landlines. :) Quit messing around and go get Vonage and up into the 21st century.</p><p>In all seriousness. Vonage is great. Local and long distance for one price and it has a lot of cool feature. All this for $25 buck a month. Do what I did, just keep the landline for emergencies.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hah hah ha ha sigh sob sob sob!</p><p>Let me tell you about my Symantec adventure delving into buying WinFax Pro 10.whatever online.</p><p>1. Select product WinFax Pro 10 - check<br>2. Neglect that Symantec are still selling a product not designed for WinXP but discretely disguise the fact - check.<br>3. Order said product online with hammered (thanks Studio 8) and download all 56+Mb of it.<br>4. Attempt to install it. Activate it - fail.</p><p>They sold me a product online that technically they no longer provided. It was impossible to 'activate'. After purchasing Norton IS 2005 I was distinctly underwhelmed - especially when the email I madly sent was not responded to.</p><p>So thankfully a toll free phone call to India (where all the call centers appear to be these days) listening to spanish guitar music for 10 minutes - talking to a new (Aussie) sounding chap after listening to horrid Classical something (and I like classical) ...</p><p>A refund of original purchase.</p><p>A re-order of a tangible product (not downloadable but the box version).</p><p>Strewth. Who said shopping online was easy? I needed this software NOW so was sorely dissapointed. Kudos to Symantec for looking after me (I was in there system at least).</p><p>Please make the Studio 8 upgrade more tangible!</p></div>
