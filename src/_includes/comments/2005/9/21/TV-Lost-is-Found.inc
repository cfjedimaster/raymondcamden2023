		<div class="comment_text"><p>I missed it last season but saw the last episode and I was kicking myself for not seeing the rest of the season! So I bought the dvd two weeks ago and made my fiance watch it with me and now she thinks this show is amazing too. I can't wait for tonight :D.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with your sentiments exactly. My wife and I started watching the show over the summer. The island is a good hook, but we are more interested in finding out more about the characters than the island now.</p><p>Cheers!</p></div>
