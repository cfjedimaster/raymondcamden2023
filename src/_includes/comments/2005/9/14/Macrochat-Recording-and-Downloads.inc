		<div class="comment_text"><p>A note about BlogCFC, Shared Hosting and ScriptProtect... <br>Yesterday morning I was trying to make a post to my BlogCFC blog, and happened to be adding an embeded WMV in the MORE section of the post.  Upon uploading and not seing it, I noticed &lt;code&gt;&lt;invalidTag&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in place of my object and embed tags.  Searching through the code led me only to google.  Basicaly I've found that my host has enabled Global Script protect and I've got to turn it off in my application.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>ok, how bad is this: I only just this morning viewed this presentation! Well It was good as long as I could stand to watch... your silky smooth voice got further and further ahead of the screen and I couldn't keep track... I have noticed problems with every breeze session I've seen. Usually the sound is screwed up completely but this time it was only out of sync. This is one great product that still needs work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was looking at the code for sql injection and I noticed that you didn't use CFFORM, you just used normal html form and fields. why didn't you use cfform with all the validate this and validate that, maxlength, required, etc? [What would Mike Nimer say?]</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't use cfform. Simple as that. The main reason is that I want exact control over my error formatting. As you know, by default, cfform uses an ugly error screen that doesn't use your own site layout. I -will- use cfform for small RIAs (ie, flash forms).</p></div>
