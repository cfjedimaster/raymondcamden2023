		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray</p><p>I can't say thanks enough for your praise.  I consider it high indeed, as I certainly consider you one of my CF mentors.  You unknowingly saved my backside many a time during the old Spectra days.  In fact, the DB running at several of the sites owned by my employer &lt;em&gt;still uses a Spectra CODB&lt;/em&gt; albeit with the Spectra tags completely rewritten as a Mach-II app.<br>Suffice it to say &lt;em&gt;The ACME Guide&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; be free and licensed under Creative Commons.  I'm already working on some additions for RIA development - early days yet.  Keep watching.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Probably worth noting, for those that don't know that ACME stands for Apache, ColdFusion, MySQL, and Eclipse (or more specifically, CFEclipse).</p><p> From what I could tell, it is a good read even if you use IIS and SQL Server.  Maybe someone should put together an SICE guide.  ( SQL Server, IIS, ColdFusion, Eclipse ).  I plan to give cf-eclipse another try (I didn't like it the first time) using that guide as install instructions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>This is great thanks for the pointer, if only something like this was around in '95 when i got into this industry ;)  And it's not just for noobs either ;)  Hell, the cfeclipse stuff is well worth the download, especially with mention to the webservices explorer - just fantastic.</p><p>Cheers for the pointer, and cheers to the author!</p><p>Tomo</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This book saved my butt switching from a double click install of Apache/PHP to Apache/CF/Flex2/FDS2 (free version). I followed it to the letter, but as I wanted to keep my Apache2Triad AND get Flex 2 and FDS2 working, I had to augment it a bit: for the FDS2 to work under port 80, I added the Tomcat install at: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brightworks.com%2Ftechnology%2Fbrightworks_articles%2Fsetting_up_a_windows_tomcat_fds_server.html%3AOyiaSv07_Q-mkpFC4aO87FBFYMY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.brightworks.com/technology/brightworks_articles/setting_up_a_windows_tomcat_fds_server.html">http://www.brightworks.com/...</a></p><p>And if you follow the ACME guide to the letter, after installing Apache2triad (with the obvious augments for path locations...really it was that simple...eventually, if you use the hotfix for Apache 2.2 and in my case, use the hotfix to get MySQL 4/5.x running using 'other'...both available on Adobe's pages...required for Ray's blog, FYI, if you use the Apache2Triad MySQL version), followed by the FDS2 under Tomcat...you have a very viable (not that I'm an expert by any means!) complete system running under port 80 (or whatever the https port is if you switch to that in Apache) capable of https (so it appears), capable of running CF, capable of running PHP, capable of running FDS2, everything under the the seemingly-secure environment of Apache, all under one web-accessible port.</p><p>Very easy, I suspect, to make this system go kablooey, but if you're like me, someone who wants to learn this stuff and experiment, needing PHP for a few things, wanting to run a core CF/Flex2 environment under a "secure" server for internet deployment, and am curious about the free FDS2 package as well, the combination above seemed the best bet after trying for a couple of months to make everything work. Read all the directions, extrapolate the paths for Apache2Triad when installing ACME (follow ACME and the Brightworks Tomcat/FDS2 articles to the letter!) and you will have a full-blown setup to get your yayas out:)</p><p>Now all I need to do is learn how to configure my 5 domains under all this with my single static IP. I don't have that part figured out yet, but I know the correct info for everything but FDS2 is there in the ACME book (see the VirtualHosts area).</p><p>Shawn</p></div>
