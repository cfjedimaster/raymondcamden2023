		<div class="comment_text"><p>brutal, i got it last year.  nothing you can really do to get rid of it either, anti-biotics just kind of hold it at bay and make it somewhat bearable.  doc said it's just a virus and it needs to run it's course, took about 2 weeks for me, although i didn't have it nearly as bad as you.  Some days it looks like it's getting better others it will appear to spread around to strange areas that you know were covered but that's normal from what i understand, it's just moving around in your body.</p><p>just stay away from ridiculous home remedies like pouring bleach on it or popping the blisters.</p><p>good luck..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>It's probably too late for this round, but next time (and there will be a next time!) try Zanfel.  IT's expensive ($40/tube) and doesn't work quite as well as they claim (at least on me) but it's still the best treatment around. It's usually reduces my bouts from 3 weeks and very ugly to 1 week and just some redness.</p><p>btw, it's not a virus just very, very nasty allergic reaction to the oil in the plant. Zanfel bonds with the oils and allows you to wash them away - so the sooner you use it the better.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had poison ivy pretty bad in the past myself.  The first time I got in on some running trails.  My legs swelled up pretty large and I couldn't walk for weeks.</p><p>Each time it's gotten "that bad" I've had to use steroidal cream (prescription only).  Just something to ask the doctor about if you're looking for remedies (goes away pretty quickly with it).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Next time around... The oil that is in Poison Ivy is what causes the problem. As soon as you touch a spot or if it gets on your clothes, the oils end up everywhere...especially on your hands. If you use alchohol as soon as you discover it, you have a good chance of removing the oils and saving yourself a lot of aggravation.</p><p>Bob</p></div>
