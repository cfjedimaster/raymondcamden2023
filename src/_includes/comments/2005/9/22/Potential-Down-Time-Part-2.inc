		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I work for SBC (the 'other' big phone co) and got an email yesterday showing the damage to some of the Bell South Central Offices.  It's no surprise that phone service is still sporadic - some of the CO's are completely gone!  If you're interested, I'll email you the pics.</p></div>
