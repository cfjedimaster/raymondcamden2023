		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have been playing the need for speed series on the PC since NFS III. NFS:Porsche Unleashed was my favorite and the only thing that comes close is NFS Underground 2. The only thing I don't like about it is you can't sell back the parts you buy like you could on NFS:Porsche. No damage on NFSU2... you could really mangle your car on NFS:Porsche. NFSU2 allows you to just drive around if you want to and race any one of a number of types of races (I like the sprint and drift races the best) so it's kinda non-linear.</p></div>
