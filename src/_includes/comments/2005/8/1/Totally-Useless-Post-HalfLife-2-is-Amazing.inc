		<div class="comment_text"><p>Its a really fun game with stunning graphics.  Some parts of the plot kinda suck (no spoilers), but the game engine is impressive.</p><p>There are mods out there that let you do even more impressive things with the engine.  When you've gotten to a point where you need a break, make sure to take a look around for some of the custom mods.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>I too am running this game on WUXGA and I agree it is the most ridiculously detailed scenery of any game I've ever played (right down to the characters' eye movements).  I'm about 1/4 of the way through according to my friend- simply amazing.<br>Sean</p></div>

Never could get into the idea of starting over to get back up to 1/2 way through.</p><p>Incredible game though! Hope you enjoy it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A similar thing happend to me last year w/ Unreal Tournament. I 'never' play games - and picked this one up. What's funny, is that I quickly learned that the game wasn't just a game - it's a "Development Platform" for 3D games, movies, simulations, anything.</p><p>As a developer - you should do yourself a favor and look under the hood. Both UT2004 and HL2 are great for exploring as development environments. I've spent more time in the Unreal Editor now than in the game - it's amazing - very flexible and a blast to use.</p><p>Are you aware of "Machinia" - I'm sure you are :) Most people have heard of Red vs Blue - but there's a lot more happening in this arena than RvsB. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Machinima.com%3Anmq37NTTe30vOpxDmIxy8B2Bb08&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.Machinima.com">http://www.Machinima.com</a></p><p>I went out and bought a game so I could get my mind off of development and instead, I found a new development platform to explore. I've made a few maps - and a music video for one of my songs using Unreal: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonicwallpaper.com%2Fvideo%2Ftheflagchamber.cfm%3AfSwTxlw8mo4uawT1muwD4LocUvM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.sonicwallpaper.com/video/theflagchamber.cfm">http://www.sonicwallpaper.c...</a></p><p>There's so much more that can be done w/ this technology than just 'games.' For example - the "Serious Games Summit" is growing, in addition to "Advergaming" as a market. This points towards new opportunities in software development - maybe not the kind most Web developers get into - but it's going to be a hot area.</p><p>BTW - I still have my ORIGINAL Atari 2600! :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Fantastic game and tech... for developers, probably the most interesting mod out there that is definitely worth a look is "Garry's mod", which basically harnesses the physics engine to allow you to build various strange constructions out of game elements, such as a giant robot made of oil drums and cars, held together with pulleys and ropes... a virtual erector set, if you will.</p><p>You really have to try it to fully see how cool it is.</p><p>BTW, I'm on my second run through the game... I finished it a few months back, but now downloaded the HL:Substance mod, that reworks the whole game by adding more monsters and new plus modified weapons everywhere... and also lets you shape-shift between the standard Gordon Freeman and 3 characters from the Metal Gear game series. The plot of the original game goes out the window somewhat with this mod, but it's a lot of fun.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't rush on getting PC games since I only play about 1 hour of PC games a week. I only play maybe 4-5 of XBox, if I'm lucky. It's not that I don't love video games - I do - but with a big family, I can't take time away from them.</p></div>
