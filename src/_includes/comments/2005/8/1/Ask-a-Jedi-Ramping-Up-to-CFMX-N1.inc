		<div class="comment_text"><p>Being very new to coding, I've only seen one new release (7.0).  Since I was somewhat familiar with the language before 7.0, I found it very helpful to use the code snippets on MM's site to learn the new tags and functions.  Once I pulled up the example in the snippets, I'd refer to the MM documentation to read up some more on the tag or function I was interested in.  I'm kinda the same as you Ray, where I'd then throw something into my local host and tweak it a little bit to see it on the page - it seems to make more sense when you actually make it work (or break it) yourself.  Another thing I find helpful is to search the old live docs for the tag to get some history/examples that may have been dropped from the current docs.  I've found some VERY helpful things in the old documentation.</p></div>
