		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's _all_ about storytelling -- a game, a novel, a musical, a movie. It's all about the way you talk about the specifics of the human experience in universal ways. Interesting characters who actually have depth (and aren't simple punchlines) involved in interesting sequences of events told or visualized in interesting ways -- that's what makes a good narrative.</p><p>I totally agree, Ray, about the ending of the series. It was both unexpectedly moving, funny (Brenda's death was hilariously appropriate), and enormously powerful. I have not seen a better series finale than the last few minutes of "Six Feet Under" and lord knows I watch a lot of TV.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had been getting seriously bummed out by the episodes leading up to this one. But man, that final scene with her driving and the fast forward was so powerful. It actually made me think a lot about life. The only downside... they were showing 2070 or something... where the heck were the flying cars!!!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad you mentioned this--I also thought this was very, very, very well done.  I've been a die-hard fan since day one and couldn't have thought of a better way to wrap up the series.  I still can't figure out how they pulled it off but you're right, watching how everyone died was very uplifting.  I'll be watching the very end a couple more times.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>as far as 'good' TV goes, you're right for the most part.  i can't speak of shows on Showtime as all we've ever had is HBO...but they do put out consistently good shows.</p><p>the two notable exceptions that come to mind (for me, at least) are Lost and House.  i find both of these to be fantastic storytelling.  obviously you watch Lost (mentioned above).  Give House a shot if you haven't.  Best...TV...ever. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>um...i should probably point out that by 'notable exceptions', I meant good TV that's on the networks as opposed to cable.</p><p>in re-reading it sounded a little like I was suggesting Lost and House were the only two BAD shows on cable.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just saw the episode last night in Hbo Latin america, I already knew the plan of killing all the characters in the end. It was an amazing show: the third season (at the beginning, without Brenda) wasn't so good, but this last one was extraordinary, it made me laugh sometimes like in the first one, and it was amazing the funeral of Nate. The final episode really made me cry (sorry, but that's true), it was very well done and specially the part in the front of the house, Claire saying goodbye, leaving all behind while his brother followed her for a while. It was a VERY GOOD show and I will miss it, but it makes me fell good they ended it at the right time.</p></div>
