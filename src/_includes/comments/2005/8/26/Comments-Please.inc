		<div class="comment_text"><p>The "ask a Jedi" content you've been doing lately is nice-- I don't work with a lot of front-end stuff, so reading about how to do X in &lt;cfform&gt; has been good to read for instance.</p><p>It might be because I don't currently use any of your software, and I don't mean any offense at all (just giving you some honest feedback), but it seems like a lot of your entries which get aggregrated to the goog are "released this minor revision and fixed a bug of X software".  It might be better to put this in some sort of release category and not aggregate it to fullasagoog, but I'm probably in the minority?  :)</p><p>I would think that major milestones would be fine, but every little fix seems to add up quickly.  Or maybe you are aggregating your main feed rather than your ColdFusion feed?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like your Coldfusion 101 idea a lot. Yes, your main audience is probably experienced Coldfusion developers, but by doing a Coldfusion 101 series experienced developers can get a glimpse of doing something a different way, thinking about something in a different way and refreshing their minds on the way to do things they may not do regularly.Meanwhile you'll be opening you blog up to Coldfusion beginners through good old search engine results.</p></div>

If so, I'll point you to the good guys over at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fasfusiun.com%3A9Lf1UJSqEMv4JKbxDNABqhA-6RY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asfusiun.com">asfusiun.com</a>. ;)</p><p>Scott: Ask and you shall receive.</p><p>Brandon: I hear ya. I think most aggregators just use my main feed. Of course, I typically tag my BlogCFC, Soundings, etc type posts as CF as well. I'm going to agree to disagree here and keep posting them as such. No offense taken. :)</p><p>Leif: Thanks. I'll see what others think and start thinking of some simple CF type questions. Maybe start real simple - how do I check for a valid email address for example.</p></div>

I like being able to aggregate a blog but until someone makes an equivalent to RSS for forums its hard to check them all the time. Until someone maybe makes a forum aggregating software :) wink wink nudge nudge ya know what i mean...<br>(well I guess you'd have to convince all the forum software makers to have an XML feed first... hmm how hard is it to get a patent?)<br>I like the 101 idea<br>Another good idea for you, something I was going to start blogging but got too busy at work, is often overlooked but very useful CF tricks. For example I still meet a developer or two that set a bunch of variables in application.cfm rather than using the simple functions MM has provided to work with ini files.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My intention for the Ask a Jedi series was advanced or 'wierd' style questions, so your question is perfect. Of course, I have no idea what the answer is. I have an idea - CF passes your SQL to the db. DBs that support transactions simply accept the input from CF. Ie, CF isn't do anything special besides using the transaction support already built in the db itself. Does that make sense? Probably not a great answer.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>so cf sees that the 3 queries (and therefore 3 db connections)  are now wrapped in a cftransaction and changes the commands to only use one connection (otherwise it could'nt be in a reansaction). it then uses the driver to provide the correct transaction syntax for that db...</p><p>...perhaps?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been working with CF flash forms lately so anything on that would be good. <br>specifically, re-querying cfselect and cfgrids without submitting a form.<br>How about info for people that already know how to do stuff in a different technology like microsoft Access or flash and just want to apply it to Coldfusion.<br>Of course I have the WACK and Advanced WACK and the study guide but maybe something inbetween. Once you already have the basics down, a different book that concentrates on methodology, architecture for common scenarios with finished working code. I bought the Reality CFMX Intranet book but it's pushing the envelope to get the code working or adapted.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>here's another for instance: I'm doing a simple flash form... applying style attributes to the text boxes, panel and buttons. did you know you could specify a  headerHeight:35; to a panel? I didn't see it in the docs but I wanted to do it so I checked out the flex style explorer and found the attribute: header-height so I figured I'd try out the "Flash-Equivalent" and it worked. I bet there's a ton of stuff you could do that isn't in the standard livedocs! If only there was an exhaustive resource for each kind of control. If only there was a book targeted specifically on Flash forms (and maybe graphs, reports, flashpaper, xml) in coldfusion... you know... all the flashy wow stuff that makes you customer's jaws drop.</p></div>

Perhaps you could do some kind of social bookmarking.

As links are clicked, they move up in rank.</p><p>What I'm thinking of is a list of resources that people use, from books to blogs, magazines to newsgroups, websites to pdf files. As people click on these links, their popularity would make then rise in the ranking.</p><p>Here's an article on social bookmarking: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdlib.org%2Fdlib%2Fapril05%2Fhammond%2F04hammond.html%3AHArYfQPoHhK707R1F3956Cu6pJs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html">http://dlib.org/dlib/april0...</a><br>And a website that practices it:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%3ATFCVT1TLM3gIVvhu7UvDqoNlAOY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a></p></div>
