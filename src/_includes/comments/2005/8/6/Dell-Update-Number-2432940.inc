		<div class="comment_text"><p>Some batteries are like that, they take a full cycle or two to get up to full speed, so maybe yours is one.  Its been too long since I spent any time geeking about the particulars so I don't remember for certain.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Somnetimes, depending on the battery type you need to charge and drain the battery a few times to get the max charge.  When I wokred as a paramedic, we needed to do this anytime we got new batteries for our portable EKC machine.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sometimes the machine misreads the amount of juice in the battery. I had one that would freak out and try and go into stand-by (which meant I would have to plug in the machine, take out the battery and push the little display button on the battery itself)</p></div>
