		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray: It can get quite a bit more complicated than that. Different cell providers do different things with photomail... Sprint, for example, doesn't send the photo as an attachment. They send an embedded, encoded XML chunk that you have to decode and parse, which *then* tells you where to find the image.</p><p>Which is still tons easier than it used to be. When I was implementing moblogging in JournURL in 2003, Sprint wasn't even sending the XML. So I spent days reverse-engineering their photo-sharing site, teaching the app how to crawl from the URL in their email, through a half-dozen intermediate pages, to the actual image file.</p><p>I'm surprised I still have hair.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>4.0 sounds nice! Personally, I think a hit counter or stats page would be nice to have.</p><p>I can try and help with the css/xhtml. Heres a small one that gets rid of the &lt;p&gt; tags to space your pods :) Drop the tags and add this to the css:</p><p>.rightMenu {<br>	margin-bottom: 12px;<br>}</p><p>Good luck w/ the update. If you want, I will spend some time on the xhtml/css as I was kind of working on doing that to your app already.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Suggestions...<br>Currently your sharing the date style with other elements. It would be nice to seperate the styles in non layout.cfm pages. Also, replace the hr tags with div's and styles. Your not too far away from being able to fully control the site with layout.cfm and a style sheet.  It would make upgrading versions alot nicer for those of us with custom layouts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray: I understand (hey yours look so much better than mine ;) My post was poorly worded: Request is more specific to a   'page views'/'hit counter' type of stat reported.</p><p>Another suggestion. Your using line breaks to stack the content in the pods. A ul/li would be semantically better for 2 reasons. 1) seo prefers this. tells the engines its a list, as thats what it is. 2) CSS control over the list can be used to create a number of layout effects (mouseovers/etc)</p><p>(from archives.cfm)<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>  &lt;cfloop query="cats"&gt;<br>    &lt;cfif entryCount&gt;<br>      &lt;cfoutput&gt;<br>      &lt;li&gt;[Your Code]&lt;/li&gt;<br>      &lt;/cfoutput&gt;<br>    &lt;/cfif&gt;<br>  &lt;/cfloop&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;</p><p>Then we can style the list using this declaration:<br>.rightMenu li {<br>   margin-bottom: 7px;<br>   do-something-else-cool: youBetIWill;<br>}</p><p>&lt;b&gt;Is there a blog.cfc forum or group setup anywhere?&lt;/b&gt;<br>Would gladly participate.</p><p>Any chance of a simple editor being setup for the blog entry system?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Michael - a very quick response as I'm fixing to leave. Whether or not I go to Aura, I'm definitely doing a HTML 'clean up'. Someone sent me a XHTML update to my code which I'll probably use, but in general, I'm going to clean the heck out of it.</p><p>Is there a blogcfc forum - yep - check the Galleon Forums link in the My Tools pod.</p></div>
