		<div class="comment_text"><p>Personally I push for either HP e-PCs (all-in-one systems) or probably home-brew Athlon64 or Opteron systems (using the new nForce Professional chipsets).  The e-PCs are great for e.g. customer service people who don't need anything beyond the basics, and Athlon64 systems make great workhorses.  Then again I'm a geek and can juggle hardware as needed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Funny - I've had a similar experience.  I've always loved Dell and my last laptop was an Inspiron 8500 - it was super slick at the time that I bought it. Not too long ago, my Dell stopped recognizing one of my RAM chips and was having all sorts of boot issues and lue screens of death. I had a 24 hour response international service contract with Dell for the laptop and this was the first time I'd called them from anywhere but the UK. The US support people couldn't confirm my service # because it was from the UK - which I thought was crazy. I wasn't even transferred to the UK office - they made me call them myself. After doing that I spent 20 minutes on the phone with them - no help at all and they then transfered me to India. India, believe it or not, was the only support office that was friendly or helpful, though they also couldn't fix the problem on the phone... but they did give me ammunition to use when calling Dell US again. Dell US the second time around was also no help, and get this - my international support contract wouldn't be honored until I waited 5 days for it to be transfered to the US, then they'd send someone.  Some 24 hour support contract, huh?  My company always buys Dells, and I kindly explained to them that I needed immediate satisfaction or I'd not only see to it that we never bought another Dell, but also that I'd be presenting in front of a lot of people using another laptop and would badmouth Dell while I presented (my laptop crash was 2 days before CFUnited). They were no help and I now hate Dell. I managed to fix the problem myself (it was actually only a 2 minute fix that they should have thought of over the phone) and presented with that laptop at CFUnited. After the conference I decided my laptop was ready for retirement, and you bet your ass I went out and bought a nice new Toshiba. My first of many non-dell laptpos and desktops to come. Dell machines are prety nice, but their support absolutely sucks, and there definitely are other nice laptops out there. I sympathise with you, Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I personally have always bought nothing but Dells. They have been nothing but the best in terms of a machine that lasts the ages. Every machine will break, every single one. When this happens, yeah it's a pain the ass to deal with, but to say that Dell in is the new Packard Bell is the dumbest thing I've heard. IBM's are great (I actually worked for them in the early 90's) but they are double the price of a Dell and don't look anyway near as good (XPS laptop.... drooooooool).</p><p>Besides being the best in the computer hardware market, they are also the best in the comuter software market. I can't tell you how many people I know have a copy of WinXP and / or Office2003 from Dell. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We buy dells here in the office. Nothing but dells. I've replaced probably 10-15 dell hard drives. I built my own laptop. Pentium M, it lasts 4 hours. I built from an ASUS barebone and it was actually a lot easier to build than a desktop. Just pop open the keyboard, stick the CPU in it, stick some ram in it. Add a hard drive and CDRom and it was up and running! It was cheaper too. I know building computers isn't ideal for an office environment (that's why the office still has Dells), but for your personal/consulting computer it is probably worth it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry to hear about your customer support problems with Dell.   Dont' bother posting your experience to their support forums.  They've been removing most of "Dell Hell" posts.  Rest assured, you're not alone.  Googleing "Dell Hell" turns up hundres of thousands of blog entries.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's a shame!  We've purchased well over $150k worth of Dell servers over the past 12 months, and the (very) few problems that we've had have been solved within 24 hours by a technician that they send to us!</p><p>Did you buy the guaranteed support contracts?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't agree with putting people on hold just to get even. That only wastes time and money for that company... this cost, in turn, gets passed on to consumers. I don't want to pay for the fact that some people think it's cute to put Dell on hold.  Why should anyone's time be wasted - mine or theirs? I prefer to simply tell everyone I know that in my opinion Dell support sucks, and I will choose not buy any Dell unless it's because it's a really cheap deal and then I'd make the purchase without the support (since it's useless anyway). I was shocked that they couldn't find my support agreement in the US when I'd purchased an international support agreement.  Hell, I went to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FDell.co.uk%3AdKT1r7jKkledveHxMfeeMNvZt-A&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Dell.co.uk">Dell.co.uk</a> and put the support number in and was able to pull the details up via their website. It's ridiculous that US help desk people can't think to do the same. I was also shocked to find that the 24 hour international support contract that I paid for actually didn't guarante me a god damn thing... except, as I said, the right to change the country on my contract (which takes 5 days) and then be entitled to 24 hour support. I got the international contract because I travel a lot (especially when I lived in the UK) - I needed to know I'd be taken care of quickly wherever I was. Thank god I never needed it while travelling in Europe or Asia... I would have been screwed.</p></div>

Over the next 2 1/2 years the motherboard died and was replaced THREE TIMES!!!</p><p>After that I put together my own systems with better parts and have not had a single failure.
