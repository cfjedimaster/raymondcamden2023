		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had similar issues with Dell a year and a half back ordering a computer for my 6 year old son. It took 14 weeks, 22 calls to customer service, and a letter to each person liested on their Investor Relations website, to be delivered (and it was their dumbed-down advertised special). I was told it was back ordered because they were out of ribbon cables...give me a break. I vowed after that to never buy another Dell again and tell as many people that I could to avoid the same fate. The last two machines I've bought were from Alienware and I have been extremely happy. I bought a desktop in December of 2004 and was so happy I bought a laptop 2 months ago (best purchase I ever made next to the motor for my Chopper :)</p><p>Go Alienware, you won't be disappointed!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tom - bare in mind - I'm talking about customer support here. I've had hardware issues (obviously, the battery was sucking), but to be honest, I feel the hardware issues I've had with Dell hardware are 'normal'. Ie, I use the heck out of my machines. Over the last 5 years that I've been on Dell, I feel the problems I've had are normal for my usage.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is odd that you have such bad customer service with them (in my experience).  In fact, just this past week in about year four of my laptop I broke the hinge area that holds the lcd panel to the main computer.  My extended warranty expired in May 2004.</p><p>I called the phone number I had, gave them my service tag number, explained the problem and was forwarded to tech support.  I repeated the tag number and problem explaination and was forwarded to 'spare parts' since my warranty was expired.</p><p>I repeatd the problem again and the guy told me what part I needed, explained that it would fix my problem, suggested I install it myself instead of hiring a technician, and said the part would be here by tuesday.</p><p>So, as long as the part shows up and it actually fixes my problem the resolution only cost me about $40 and 10 minutes of my time.</p><p>Maybe I just got lucky, I don't know.  But when the machine was under warranty and it was dropped and cracked the case (shoulder strap on bag broke) they sent someone to our office that day to fix it.</p><p>Battery life does suck but I think that is as much the nature of a laptop battery and that whole "memory thing".  During the day my machine is in a docking station and at night the battery lasts about 1.5 hours.  I have two batteries in the system and I doubt one of them holds any charge at all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Further to my comment above however my battery lasts only about one hour. I think correctly conditioning the battery can help - or have a spare at least. Might check with Acer if I can buy a stronger one.</p></div>
