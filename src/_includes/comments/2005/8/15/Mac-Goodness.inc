		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am so close to buying a mac mini I can almost taste it (I think it tastes sort of like a brick as well!).  What I really want to do is put it in my truck and connect it to a touch screen monitor and hook it into my sound system, but then I might spend too much time in the car and not enough in the house.  And with the price of gas nowadays....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Congratulations on  your Mac mini.  My office gave me a new G5/dual processor 2.3GHz machine.  Needless to say, I LOVE IT!!! But also needless to say, there's no way in hades I'd be able to afford one for my home.</p><p>Tell me, do you think the mini has enough power to do the kinds of things we web developers need to do (I also do some design work too).</p><p>Good luck and welcome to the right side of the Force!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tony - to be fair, I don't know if I will know soon. For right now, the Mac cannot be my main machine. I did load CFEclipse on it with no problem though. I may consider using it as a primary box in the future, but right now I'm using it primarily for browser testing - and poking around to learn about the innards. (Like I had a heck of a time figuring out how to mod my HOSTS file - but I did figure it out.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm taking the image and FTPing it up, which is a royal pain in the rear. The new version will have a "FTP Manager". It won't be tied to an entry, ie, you will need to use it first, but it will make things easier. Basically you will upload the image and then in the entry editor still put in the full path. (Full paths are necessary because RSS feeds dont like partial URLs.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Were you talking about HOST file on you PC or getting the Mac to point several DNS name to a single IP address on a IIS server to handle multi-homing via host-headers (bit out of my depth here, so please excuse and silly error in terminology). if the latter, I have a neat solution which I can share if required.</p></div>
