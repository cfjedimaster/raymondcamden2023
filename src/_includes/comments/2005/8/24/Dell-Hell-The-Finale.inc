		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finally got my system working.  The hard drive was bad as well as perhaps the memory but.. after 8 months of dealing with dell and perhaps like 60 to 70 hours (including over 15 phone calls some 4 or more hours, two tech visits, reinstalling the OS on their suggestion multiple times etc) I got the system working.  In the end Dell replaced the motherboard, cpu, heat sink, hard drive, and memory.  I told them a couple of times that they should just replace the damn system because of the amount of time it was taking but no.  Last time a tech came to swap out the motherboard BTW i had to help him in that he was clueless and even put in the drives the wrong way and wired up the system wrong!  He also did not know how to config the BIO's which I had to do since other wise it kept looking for drives that did not exist and the default mode i guess for the BIOS is hyper threading off which sucks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Heh, I was being very sarcastic about Dell actually reading my blog. I'm a small fry when compared to the 'big boys' of blogging. ;) Feel free to post your hell here though as Robi did.</p></div>
