		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few months ago, a coworker and I found a Flash Remoting bug on an e-commerce site that showed all the database information you could ever want to know inside the Remoting Debugger. So we contacted the site owner and let them know about the bug and that it would be very easy for someone to take over their database. No response. We called their office. They treated us like we were trying to sell them something. So we emailed them a screenshot of about 100 rows of their customers credit card numbers. We finally got a thank you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know what you mean, happens to me all the time.</p><p>You won't believe this, but I once interviewed for eUniverse (before they became Intermix, owners of mySpace before Fox, and before I knew better), and before the interview, I naturally looked at their site in more detail. I was wondering what version of CF they must be running, so i appended ?mode=debug. WHOA! I could do all sorts of stuff to their site now!</p><p>So during the interview with the recruiter, I brought this up, among other flaws, and talked about how I could help them. Got the 2nd interview, and all they were concerned about was how to select the top records in SQL Server, and of course, their obsession with performance. What does speed matter if security is ignored! Needless to say, they hired a spaghetti coder, and their website was still open for about 6 months, until they realized debugging is not good for performance.</p><p>Sami</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've done this a couple times... once I did get a thank you, and the bug was fixed. Oddly, this was with someone who was a potential client and after sending them the bug I found and getting a "thanks we'll fix it" I never heard back from them.</p><p>I'm not sure which is worse, leaving someone exposed when you find a bug on their site or what seems to invariably turn into a competitive situation where they feel they've "lost" because you've found and reported an issue. At least that seems to be the reaction.</p><p>I guess I'll keep sending them out when I find them, but it's an uncomfortable situation at best... sort of a "necessary evil" thing.</p><p>Laterz!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Maybe I'll start sending them a note with an attached invoice for consulting time spent documenting the bug. ;)</p><p>We all get paid for this stuff, Ray, it's our livelihood. Taking the time to offer assistance when someone needs it deserves a thank you, regardless of the circumstances. So no, it's not too much to ask.</p><p>Laterz...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The same counts for the Macromedia bugreport. People spend lots of time, but never hear anything about it.</p><p>I understand, if you get hundreds of bugreports each day this would be an issue, but we are talking about a functionality which is hard to find on their site and I presume they are not getting 10+ bugreports each day through the form.</p><p>In the days of Allaire you at least got a reply back.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It happens, though I think most people, at least on smaller sites or smaller companies, are polite and appreciative.</p><p>Personally, whenever someone reports a mistake or problem to me on one of my site, I'm sure to thank them.</p><p>With respect and helpfulness (and appreciation), we can all help each other make the net work better.</p></div>
