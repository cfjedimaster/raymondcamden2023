		<div class="comment_text"><p>Here's a tech tip... the mute button is on your keyboard in many of the new keyboards. You can also go into Configuration pannel and put the volume on your system bar. Then you can turn off sound also.</p><p>What program do you know of that has a mute on it like you are asking for anyway? Powerpoint? Word? Wordperfect? I know there are some programs that have volume control. The feature is nice... but to win this battle you are going to have to sell a major browser on it. (And if I am right Flash doesn't "channel" it's sound through the browser. It would require a new version of flash just to respond. This means old versions wouldn't respond.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John: I'm not trying to mute the OS - just the application. All media players typically have a mute button that only affect themselves. A browser isn't a media player per se - but it does play embedded media, so I don't think it is as far fetched as having a mute button MS Word. If indeed Flash's audio bypasses the browser itself, then I'd love to see Flash 8 have a way to block audio.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A browser is no more a media player than windows. Flash is a player more in the sense of direct X or an active x component than say Real Player or something like that. Neither one is actually a "media player" (that is neither flash or the browser). What you need is to get all the people writting flash productions to give you a mute button. There would not be a default button specific to the browser because the browser doesn't "detect" that audio is running inside a plugin. What you want would require the plugin to check with the browser to know if the user wanted it to play audio. Since the feature doesn't currently exist... even if the browser added the application messaging to allow for that... only newer plugins could respond to it. You will have to conquer the browser companies and all the media companies at the same time. (For directly executed audio files this would work... but not for plugins.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well geeze, I can still wish can't I? ;) I don't think it is unreasonable to say that if an app allows for sound to come out - whether it is an plugin in the app or the app itself - that there should be a way of preventing it. Opera manages to do it (supposedly, I haven't actually tested it), so Firefox could try it as well. It could, for example, prevent sounds from _non_ plugin sources.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It may be possible on the Mac or Linux... though not likely. The point is that the plug ins are talking to the Operating System. The browser is just the container where they run. I would be careful with the features you are asking for... they are (my belief) talking to the OS and to change those features is to ask the browser to start controlling the OS based on current design. The mute button on your laptop is a much safer approach since it won't cause dll conflicts in windows.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE: I share your wish... and thought it through deeply. That doesn't mean I am 100% right. You know there could be a hidden feature that was never implemented that we do not know about! It would indeed be a nice feature.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>P.S.<br>To the author who said "Yet another reason to dislike flash."... this is a plugin issue. It exists with all plugins. The problem isn't flash. It's lack of foresight in designing the browser and the plugins. (Someone should sue the guy who claims to be responsible for plugins. He seems to want to take all the credit, give it to him.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i totally understand what youre saying. yes a browser is a media player. it displays media! media is defined as images, movies, audio, music, written information. its all media, and all a browser does is display that media. some sites have sound with no controls whatesoever, even when it isnt a flash site. you can embed midi files into a site and there is no way to shut it up (besides modifying settings for that particular site)</p><p>i like to play flash games while using winamp to listen to music, but some flash games dont have a mute button. why cant the browser window have a mute button like every other media player? at least a plugin to do something like that.</p><p>the guys above are wrong. plugins dont interface with the os driectly. they interface with the os THROUGH the browser, hence browser plugin, not standalone program.</p><p>simply put, the browser passes the audio data to the os's sound drivers. there should be a way to stop that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What would be ideal is if a plugin could be configured so that only the sound coming from the active tab in Firefox is heard and all other tabs are muted. When you switch from one tab to another, only the sound in the active tab is heard.</p><p>Too bad this is so difficult to implement within the browser only.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The best solution I've found for this is via Audio Hijack Pro.<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frogueamoeba.com%2Faudiohijackpro%2F%3AFcwNrG9ZU7TnBIkaRW1XFTdb-XA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">http://rogueamoeba.com/audi...</a><br>The unregistered version has no limitations (unless you plan to use the recording feature for more than 10 straight minutes after your trial period is up.)<br>Just open it up, select Firefox as the application, click "Hijack", and then hit "Mute" right next to it. It will mute ONLY the application you have it set on, nothing else.<br>Works perfectly.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can manually mute Firefox by creating a file notepad file called "msacm32.dll" and inserting it into the firefox C: folder.  To unmute, just delete or move the file.</p><p>I suspect that this is simular to what the aforementioned apps do.</p></div>
