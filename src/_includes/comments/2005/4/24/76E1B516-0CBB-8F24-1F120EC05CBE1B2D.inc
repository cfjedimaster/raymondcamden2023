		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks so much for the nod, Ray. I've heard your plea about the name of the blog and have done a few things to address it, including changing the blog title (as shown on screen) to separate the words "Tipical Charlie", as well as adding a description to the top of the blog and showing an explanation for where the name comes from.</p><p>Like many new things, I hope time will cause the content to overcome challenges with the name. We can all remember when we first learned of FullAsAGoog! :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I learned a lot from Charlie back in the old days when he was at Figleaf in DC and was helping with the CFUG. He explains topics clearly and there is a lot of common sense to his development approach. I'm glad he started up a blog!</p></div>
