No backup copies without permission from the person you bought it from?  No "mixed tapes" for your friends?  No taping a TV show?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>dvd player: I disagree. There are federal rules for many products. Guns is a good example. You can vote with your pocket book and simply not buy a DVD player because you feel the DRM on DVDs is too restrictive (or you don't like the fact that you can't fast forward past crap in the beginning). You do have the option to not buy the player.</p><p>Am I advocating no fair use rights? Not at all. The current law for DVDs gives us no fair rights. I'd like to see that changed. I don't believe it is a great evil though - to me it is just a rule. I don't care enough to not buy DVDs.</p><p>As for TV - I definitely do not agree with Valenti. My feeling is that if you broadcast a signal, anyone should have the right to receive it and do with it what they want. Unlike software where you click to agree to certain rules, TV signals are 'thrown' at you. It's like someone driving by and throwing money at your house. They can't their mind after the fact.</p></div>
