I was so proud of myself I called my mom =)</p><p>Should I hope for my daughter to want to be just like Princess Amidala?  Hmm... pregnant out of wedlock, and the father is the most evil man in the universe?  Maybe not.</p><p>Maybe she'll have aspirations to be the first female Lord of the Sith.  (Since all trained Jedi seem to be men, I suspect that ONLY the dark side would accept her...</p></div>
