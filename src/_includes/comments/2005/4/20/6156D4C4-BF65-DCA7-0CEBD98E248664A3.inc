		<div class="comment_text"><p>Mac, Mac, all the way Mac.  I started using a Mac about 3 years ago--I got one of the flat-panel iMacs as a gift and said I'd use it for a week to try it out, and I never changed back to a PC.  My wife can testify that I hardly ever yell at my computer anymore. ;-)  That whole "it just works" line you get from Mac users is 100% true.  As a developer you'll really love it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One more thing that concerns me. I've been told that Macs will work with any flat panel display. But as far as I know, this isn't "Official." I just got a Dell 24 inch flat screen. I've read about folks using it on G5s, macminis, etc... but it isn't officially supported. I'd be in deep trouble if it didn't work.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i use both a pc(fulltime job) and a mac(freelance work). With a mac you get this: xcode2, interface builder, OSX.7, dashboard, itunes, ichat, and all the x11 free software you can find-GIMP for example(this does require some other installs). The option to get iphoto, garageband, idvd, imovie hd for 79 bucks(with garage band you can download and screw around with the new NIN single), If your into more professional strength you can jump to the final cut studio just announced. I'm a big fan of having both platforms. Keeps me from getting too convinced of one religion. Also i play all my games on the xbox. So i would say go with a mac-but i would suggest rolling back to the middle speed G5. Generally i find these to be the best price/performance ratio. In the end all i can say is i enjoy sitting down with my mac and doing work because it just interacts with me the way i want it too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I started out using Mac desktops with Unix servers a long time ago. Then I had my own Macs at home (running System 6, then System 7 and 7.5). I also ran Tenon Intersystems MachTen - a mach 2.5 kernel BSD 4.3 Unix. It ran alongside System 6 and 7 - much like today's OS X runs both Unix and the Mac GUI.</p><p>I briefly developed on Windows 3.1 and 3.11 back in the day (for about five months) and didn't touch Windows again until 1997 when I had to buy a Fujitsu LifeBook for work. It was a p.o.s. and fell apart after a year. I replaced it with a Dell Latitude running NT. That pretty much stopped working after two years so I reformatted it and installed Red Hat 7.2.</p><p>When I joined Macromedia in 2000, I got a Toshiba Tecra 8100 which lasted 18 months before it very literally fell apart - one memory slot stopped working, the CD drive caused BSOD repeatedly. I switched to a PowerBook running Panther (10.2) then upgraded to Jaguar (10.3) and I've been very happy with it.</p><p>After about two and a half years, the case began to crack in one place and the fan started making bad noises so work replaced it with another PowerBook.</p><p>As you can tell, I'm *very* hard on my laptops but the Macs definitely last me much longer than any of the Windows machines I've had.</p><p>I owned an early color Mac laptop (the 520c). I sold it it ten years later and it was still working just fine (except the battery wouldn't hold a charge).</p><p>Based on those fifteen or so years of experience, I've nothing but praise for Macs and nothing but suspicion for Windows machines.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the monitor thing--couple of issues.  I bought a 19" Sceptre LCD (it was too darn cheap to resist) that has both DVI and RGB inputs.  The DVI is not compatible with the Mac, but it works beautifully with the DVI -&gt; RGB converter that came with my PowerBook.  I have read that where the DVI is concerned some monitors are compatible and some aren't, and I suspect that perhaps with more expensive monitors than the one I got you might have a better shot at compatibility.  Either way it looks and works great with RGB, but I'm sure it would be a bit better with DVI.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,</p><p>Mac.  I started on a Mac 128K a long time ago, left Mac for Linux then Windows at the start of the 90s until early last year when my Toshiba broke down just after MXDU and I used (with some trepidation) the Macromedia Sydney "demo" Powerbook temporarily...</p><p>I bought a PowerBook G4 1.25 with 2Gb RAM when I left Macromedia.  Yes, migrating your email etc over and the first week of getting used to it is a little hassle, since then I definitely haven't looked back. The Powerbook is incredible, it's so light I can travel for a week with laptop, power, mouse, change of clothes, toilet bag and a few giveaway books inside the 7kg cabin baggage limit now imposed in Australia - and the battery life is longer than I got from any of the Intel laptops I've owned over the years.</p><p>Main things I miss are having a slightly higher screen resolution on a laptop LCD(I used to run 1600x1200) and MS Access, which I had developed a symbiotic relationship with over the previous decade.  I'm not a gamer (used to be a flight simmer but then I got my real license) but I do have MAME and a cute space simulator called qOrbit, and I could get X-Plane if I wanted to.  I have Virtual PC 7 which is almost bearable on the G4 (runs FCS fine), should be fine on a dual G5.  Otherwise have never found software I needed that wasn't available for Mac - all the DB servers and programming tools you could poke a stick at.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Jim: As I said, I'm a hardware newbie. I hate dealing with hardware. One of the really nice things about the Dell boxes is that (typically) they are very easy to work with on the inside. Even with that though - I always get nervous opening the box. Software I can master... hardware just scares me. I think it is because I am a bit clumsy and have large hands.</p></div>

I want the G5 but the Adobe-Macromedia merger makes me wonder.</p><p>From what I've read it seems that many of Adobe's apps are still coded in carbon. I'm not sure about the upcoming CS2, but I wonder why they haven't made their apps cocoa.</p><p>Also, with Apple getting into the software side, are they going to cause Adobe to pull away from the Mac platform?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just posted to my blog recently how much I love dell.  I have bought close to a hundred different dell systems over the years (between personal and for jobs) and can probably count on two hands the times I have ever had to call support.  And the few times that I have, they always remind me just how great they are.  I do pay for the extra support in case something ever goes wrong.  For instance, I just bought my girlfriend a new inspiron laptop, and for 400 bucks more we got complete care for 4 years.  basically in 4 years she can go out to the street, throw her laptop down, take her truck and run over it, then call dell and have a brand new one tomorrow.</p><p>At the same time, as much as I love dell, I hate microsoft (posted about that too).  I really think my next machine will be a mac.  Of course you probably already realize too, most of the people that use your blog are going to be more likely going to have a mac bias, but whats wrong with that? ;)  Go with the mac so you can tell me how awesome it is and make my decision easier in a year or so.</p></div>
