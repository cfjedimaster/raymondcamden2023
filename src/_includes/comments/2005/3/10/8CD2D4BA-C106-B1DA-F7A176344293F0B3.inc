		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to say that the O.C. is an absolutely cracking series.  It's excellent.</p><p>I would try and watch the first season, well, first if you can as that will totally get you in to it.</p><p>The music is awesome.  The number of new bands I've started listening to because of it is large.</p><p>Also, it's actually pretty funny as well!  Just my type of humour.</p><p>I would say it Dawson Creek like, but a ton better, and a ton better writing and acting!</p><p>Oh, as I'm in the UK we're a bit behind, but a friend of mine gives me the BitTorrent's the day after it's been on in the US.  Thank goodness for the Internet! :)</p><p>Oh Ray, thanks for telling me about your friend who used BitTorrent to get Battlestar Galactica.  I've totally got into that series now too.  However it was a bit confusing when I didn't see the pilot!! :-\</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm just going to DVR the whole episode so I don't have to suffer through watching it, then fast-forward to the trailer!  I'm even recording it in HD!  If only I had a video capture card ... I could save it to QuickTime and contribue to society!  According to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FStarWars.com%3AfgQpRmTga-vP-M1ck_jq46FceVc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="StarWars.com">StarWars.com</a> It won't be on the Internet (for free) until Monday. :(</p><p>You can also see it with Robots starting on Friday.</p></div>
