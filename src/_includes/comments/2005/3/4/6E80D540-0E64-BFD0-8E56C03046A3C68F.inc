		<div class="comment_text"><p>i've had outlook barf on messed up email as well, used to happen once in a while w/cf-talk. i've switched to thunderbird several months now and haven't seen many issues w/messed up headers though i've got other minor problems with it:</p><p>- on one box it won't open firefox from urls in email<br>- on another box it uses ie to open urls<br>- on one box it "freezes" for few seconds every once in a while when switching between folders<br>- non-junk filters are pretty cranky (and i wish i could have imported these from outlook)</p></div>
