		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's a great Idea Ray. I've been doing that with our Intranet's data for a couple of months and I find it very nice. Basically meta data for the different tables in the db such as user logs, number of contacts update/deleted/added/by who, etc. generate RSS that is then fed through my webservice connector between the Intranet's. For simple shared data I think it is great for it's ease of use, decoupling, etc. I would love to see everything go RSS so instead of each vendor having a different custom XML file they all use RSS exspecially for API returns of data. Forgive the spelling and english.</p></div>
