		<div class="comment_text"><p>do you have a suggestion of how to "bind" a selection in cfgrid to the cf_slush tag? meaning i have a group of id's tied to the grid that i need to have populate the "selected" for cf_flush. if an item was selected in the grid then the items associated with that selection would populate the right "selected" of cf_slush and the remaining options would populate the left side.</p><p>real world example would be if a row was selected in the grid that it would populate states associated with that selection on the right of the slush and the remaining states would be on the left side of the slush.</p></div>
