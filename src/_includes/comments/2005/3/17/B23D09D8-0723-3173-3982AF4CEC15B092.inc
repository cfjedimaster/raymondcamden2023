		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have a interesting blog CFC instance deployed that has a rating scale (# of stethoscopes was literally in the spec that I got).</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Facademic.amc.edu%2Fblog%2F%3A4Ax9Ot-x1Qj4dQwGvLkfCj7ma7k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://academic.amc.edu/blog/">http://academic.amc.edu/blog/</a></p><p>There's a TON of posts in there, as each rotation of students is required to post, comment and rate at least once a week (and they get graded on it!). We are planning on providing a browseable archive of posts by MEdical Subject Heading, using some very interesting mapping software to automatically scrape the content of each post and classify it.</p><p>I'm also co-presenting a session on the use of weblogs in education at a Society of Teachers of Family Medicine conference in New Orleans next month. Your software is famous, Ray! Thanks!</p></div>
