		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I agree totally. Look at the 2004 presidential election. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FMoveOn.org%3AHRTsXcuYMukoEFSyvJ4MUML0DEk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a> and the rest of the Left Wing nuts tried to paint Bush as a backwoods naive bar-b-que jockey. Tons of lies and hypocritical pontificating. Michael Douglas, Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Babs Streisand, Tim Robbins.....did they truly believe that everyone felt that way?!</p><p>We got our answer on Nov. 2 when John Kerry went back to his relatively uneventful and mundane career as a US Senator.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Alex, Bush *is* a "backwoods naive bar-b-que jockey" and almost half of Americans think so. Or did you miss the election results?</p><p>As for "lies and hypocritical pontificating" - can we spell R-o-v-e?</p><p>Quite why you felt the need to turn Ray's post about adoption into some right-wing grand-standing, I don't know...</p><p>Ray, to me that's one of the few "dumb questions" - adopted children *are* "your children"... how could any parent treat them otherwise??</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, in truth, if pre-my sons birth i would of been one of those people who go "yeah but they aren't *really* your kids, they are someone elses, you just take care of them".</p><p>Having my son, and being a "dad" it hits you that gene pool doesn't play a role at all, its simplistic devotion to a small human being.</p><p>As a dad, i tend to not experience things as my sons mother (lets face it, she *grew* the child for 9 months and has a different level) so in many ways, i am like ray - an adopted parent. What i am trying to say is that one morning i was just plain old scott, then corey is born, suddenly a baby is handed to me and i'm like "WTF... so this is what a parent is like".</p><p>Yet (as horrible as this sounds) he was foriegn to me, simply a "small baby" being handed to me.. there was no life inspiring chime which for told that thine son is here, and a wave of euphoria rushes over me. It was simply wow, a baby is here, lets get to know each other.</p><p>The part that will bake the noodle for others, is that in many ways even if the child wasn't genetically mine, i have no doubt i would not be devoted any less to what i am now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lets talk about adoption, not partisan politics.</p><p>First off, my son isn't adopted.  But I work with a guy who just finished adopting his second kid, and a close friend used to work for an adoption agency.  Plus two cousins were adopted from Thailand when they were small.  And from this I've learned:</p><p>The parents of adopted kids from other countries are amazing.  These aren't the folks who are foster parents and farm out their kids for spare change.  Nope.  These are people who have invested months and years into getting their special child.  They've often been to the host country several times, shelled out TENS of THOUSANDS of dollars to agencies and to grease the pockets of corrupt officials.  They've filled out telephone books of paperwork before and after adoption, because at any moment an official somewhere else can determine that they aren't good parents.</p><p>By signed contract they have to provide they can provide well for their new family member.  They also have to demonstrate a loving household.</p><p>But in my experience, none of the adoptive parents care about the paperwork or the money spent.  They are just delighted to have a special child in their life.  I saw what my cousins went through growing up, and I remember the screaming contests between my parents and measured it against the reasonable and intelligent folks who were my aunt and uncle.  My Thai cousins still speak their native language, went to Ivy league schools, and are two wonderful and intelligent women.  Watching them and and other adoptive parents there are times I wish I had been adopted!</p><p>As a parent I treat my son the way my aunt and uncle treated their kids.  They are my role model for parenthood, and my son is turning out a damn sight better than I ever did.</p><p>Ray, I respect you for your programming skills.  But those don't compare to the admiration I have for you as a parent of adopted kids.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Daniel: Thanks for the kind words. As just a nit picky FYI - not all adoptions involve corrupt officials. You only hear about those cases because they make it to 20/20. Normally it is simple red tape - although the people behind the red tape have a lot involved. So for example, South Korea has the longest history of adoption by Americans, so the program is, in general, very stable. Of course - they also initiated a quota against American adoptions after Bryan Gumbel(sp) made some offhand remark during the Olympics that babies were South Korea's biggest export.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sean:</p><p>I wasn't trying to turn this into Right-wing grand standing. I'm not a right winger, and happen to think that Bush and his Admin have a long way to go in coming clean with the American People. In the same breath, I think that Kerry was a miserable, uninspiring buffon. Dean would have had my vote.</p><p>My analogy here, though, was that the groups I mentioned and the celebrities I mentioned were taking liberties and pretending to speak for all americans, much like the editors were speaking on behalf of adopted parents. Another example was Richard Geer telling the Palestians that he spoke for the whole world when telling them to vote in their elections.</p><p>As you pointed out Sean, they were speaking for a little less than half......</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>....and as for Karl Rove, Sean, I'm with you 100%. If he is found to have broken a law, he should be prosecuted like any other American to the fullest extent of the law. Cheney's Chief of Staff, too.</p></div>
