		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, actually if you read the whitepaper, it doens't state that it will DRM the monitor, the DRM is on the video card. It will be a cold day in a warm place when Slashdot editors actually read the stuff they post.</p><p>In any event, even if they WERE going to do this at the monitor level, the average person could care less. Look the only people up in arms about DRM are nerds and geeks like us. We're the ones that like to watch movies and TV shows on our computers. The average person uses their computer to do their work and that's it. If they want to watch a show, they sit in front of their TV, not their monitor.</p><p>The biggest problems that you have with a site like Slashdot is that:</p><p>a) The editors are crap. They never take the time to investigate the stories they are about to post. I think a news anchor did this recently and he had to resign.</p><p>b) FUD, that is what drives people to the site. Anytime Slashdot can post an article that raising that level, they will</p><p>c) They only look at the story from one point of view and never the big picture.</p><p>I love Slashdot, do get me wrong, but you have to make sure that you read the entire article that they post otherwise you're only getting half the story or the wrong information.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I did get that (that the DRM was in the card, not the monitor), but I think my post, well, my title for sure, confused the matter. You are 100% right.</p><p>But you are right - I like Slashdot too - but it does seem to be turning into a FUD machine. Of course - my views on DRM and copyright are probably not in the norm either.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray: We have another option... perhaps even an obligation. We tell the producers of our products (monitors, operating systems, media) what we want and expect from them.</p><p>Also, it's important to remember that law frequently follows accepted practice... a law that is struck down one day as oppressive may be embraced the next if it follows accepted norms. So loudly proclaiming that you won't accept X is a good first step toward stopping X from being legislated against you.</p><p>Voting with your wallet is an important concept in securing a consumer's rights, but it doesn't operate in isolation.</p></div>
