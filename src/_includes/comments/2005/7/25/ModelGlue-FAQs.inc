		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd be very interested in seeing the difference in performance and output between the old cflib code and the new model glue code.</p><p>I've stated many times that I've tried using these "frameworks" to make coding alot easier and everytime been disappointed by them. Every single one had tremendious overhead that a site with a decent amount of traffic would come to a hault. Not only that, the white space that was generated from these frameworks tripled the size of the content being served and this was with the ColdFusion whitespace setting on.</p><p>I think in the end I like the way I code now. I pretty much do exactly what you do, use a custom tag to hold the content and use config files for configuration settings. The custom tag layout is great because you can place a CFCONTENT tag in start executionmode and it eliminates ALOT of whitespace.</p><p>Using this technique really decreased the time it takes for me to put together an application, makes it easy for other developer to read my code and it so incredibly compact that it holds up on a high traffic site.</p></div>
