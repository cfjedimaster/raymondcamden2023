		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is one design time I have not found CSS works for layout. If you want a footer of a fixed size on the bottom of the browser... the content of the body only flows right if you use tables. If someone has a workaround for this one issue... it's the challenge I have given to some guy named Eric who wrote a book you guys have heard of maybe. I gave it to several DW MM guys... so far no one has defeated this challenge. Any takers?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Use CSS to build a web template... and I want the template to have a fixed 50 pixels from the bottom of the page. NEXT fill the body section above the bottom of the page with a little content... and have the footer stay on the bottom. NEXT Fill the content to overflow the page (without using "frames"). The footer should "push" down as the content fills the page. (My rant is that I have never yet found a way to do this with CSS vs Tables) And again... it's an open challenge to any guru who thinks he can achieve what many other gurus have not been able to achieve. (Generally I like CSS, this is one of the very few short commings. It's just a few hairs short of perfect in replacing tables is my point... not an always solution.)</p></div>

I believe this is what you are looking for.  Feel free to pull whatever you need off of there to get your layout going.  It works with Firefox, Netscape and IE, I haven't tested outside of that.  Please let me know if this helps you out.  Remember, there's a hack for any situation 8-)...</p></div>
