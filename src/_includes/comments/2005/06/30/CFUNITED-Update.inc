		<div class="comment_text"><p>The reporting and flash integration of CFMX7 are pretty hard features to beat. I wish they would add IMAP mail handling in CF, that is a good feature of BD. The reporting and PDF output are pretty cool features that BD needs to get up to speed on to compete in my mind.</p></div>
