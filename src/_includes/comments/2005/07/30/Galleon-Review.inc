		<div class="comment_text"><p>After Galleon first appeared on the DRK, I wasn't sure what the license for it would be, and I found that it had limited database support, so I started working on my own solution, which I entitled CFMBB (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfmbb.org%3Ab5Ode9BWlG_yXQPa0CfusBL_Nqc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.cfmbb.org">www.cfmbb.org</a>).  I have since abandoned it in favor of working my my blog app, and I'm happy to see that Galleon has matured and the "license" for it is more open ("You can use it!").</p><p>Now that *MY* blog is close to where I want it to be, I might have considered going back to work on CFMBB, but I'm not going to because I think Galleon is perfectly suitable.</p><p>Great work, Ray!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The compitition! I must kill you now! :) The license is now more free for sure, but the db support never really changed. Like the rest of my apps I just focus on MySQL, Access, and SQL Server. Thanks for the kind words!</p></div>
