		<div class="comment_text"><p>That sucks! I've been playing the game as well. It's a good little time killer and w/the PSP's suspend feature, you can turn the thing on mash some buttons, then suspend and go back to your day.</p><p>Do you purchase have a saved game before the map was generated? Maybe you can go back to a previous saved game before the map was generated. I usually use one main saved game and then an alternate that I use whenever I level up. I may add a second save right before I enter a new map.</p><p>What map is it? Perhaps there's another way to get to the level on the other side.</p><p>I like the game, but here are my biggest complaints:</p><p>* The random item generator sucks. I found a bunch of +12 strength rings at the beginning of the game and haven't seen a ring near that powerful since. Also, often I have items in my inventory that I've had for a while, yet I'll come across some weapon that's just about as powerful, but I need to be like 3 or 4 levels higher in order to use it. I'm like level 28 now and really haven't seen any magical bonuses that are really that much better than any other items for at least 20 levels now. Granted the base damage/armour rating is a *little* better, but not enough to warrant the level restrictions.</p><p>* I wish when you teleported back to a map that the orientation would be the way it was when you teleported out. Or at least it should go to the map north (whatever direction that is.) I often get disorientated when teleporting back to a map--especially a new one.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dan - You are right - I should have mentioned the suspend feature, which is one more thing that puts the PSP over the GB. I agree that the random items are rarely any good - but I still enjoy looking at them. I'm a freak I guess. :)</p><p>Mark: Nope, I'm not playing _any_ PC games now. I'm mainly playing Halo 2 (xbox) and Need for Speed (PSP).</p></div>
