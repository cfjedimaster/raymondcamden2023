		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm wondering why they want to move away from tigris. They seem to show awareness of the question and then evade it. "A number of reasons" isn't really an answer. Tigris is a great open source resource that has contributed a huge amount to the community.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>TOm: Yes, I am. However, I should say, even if you don't like CFE after you try it, I highly recommend you upgrade. CFS 4.52 is quite old. The latest version of CFS is HomeSite+ 5.5, available on the Dreamweaver CD.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Jim,</p><p>The primary reason for wanting to move away from Tigris is that the system is so unreliable as to be almost unusable a lot of the time. Checking code in and out of CVS can take up to 10 attempts before it succeeds and historically the website has down or extremely slow about  10% of the time making it difficult or impossible for people to download cfeclipse or get information.</p><p>Apart from these issues, the tigris site provides nothing in the way of release management for versions of the software and no tracking or analysis tools to let you know even the simplest information like the number of downloads. Managing project information and updating the site is another PITA because you have to do it all via FTP and as has already been said, the servers are so unreliable that you never really know how long it is going to take to be able to get the latest stuff uploaded.</p><p>Next up, you have to sign up with Tigris in order to be able to submit bugs or join any of the mailing lists. That puts a lot of people off and it also means that if we want to manage registered users we need to trawl through the many thousands of Tigris subscribers to find the user we want.</p><p>The project management tools and issue tracker are also in serious need of a usability review and branding your own project is nearly impossible.</p><p>I didn't think including all that in the email I sent out to the various lists was appropriate, so I just said there were a number of resons, but since you asked, there you have it ;-)</p></div>
