		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with jedimaster! Nobody seems to understand the way MM thinks about hotfixes and updaters. And I think there is more behind that than we, mortals, know, i.e, there is a market related issue on it as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Your points are well taken.  For the Updater for CFMX 7 that we are currently working on, I added a link to the hot fix page in the "Resources" page of the administrator.  But of course you will need to go to the updates page to get this update. :-)</p><p>Don't get me started on why Allaire/Macromedia stopped releasing updates with version numbers that change in logical ways.  See the link above for how we work.</p><p>I did manage to change the definition of the third number in the server.productVersion variable to be "service pack", so the updater will be easy to identify (7,0,1,&lt;buildnumber&gt;).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tom, I know it isn't your area (the public web site), but can you suggest, if you agree of course, that <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macromedia.com%2Fdownloads%2Fupdates%2F%3AL8DArhvWeq-nRYUIzs24CewCfPE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.macromedia.com/downloads/updates/">http://www.macromedia.com/d...</a>, which is the first link I think people will hit, have some kind of text mentioning the hot fixes? At least until the real updater is released. Again - I worry people will think nothing has been released for CFMX7 (and I may be just worrying too much - or I may have been too lazy at first. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I bookmarked this URL a long time ago and it's all I use now because I got a bit frustrated myself:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macromedia.com%2Fgo%2Ftn_17883%3AsoJ_0oEvMAW6lGIMPSSd37XcUCo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.macromedia.com/go/tn_17883">http://www.macromedia.com/g...</a></p><p>Funny enough, I never got frustrated by the terminology difference (to me, Updater is to Microsoft Service Pack, which suggests it's a cumulative rollup to get everybody to a base version) so much as the search on the site. For example, I just went to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FMM.com%3A_jFrtukSk4K2-YW9sEy0r8MhKxU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="MM.com">MM.com</a> and typed in 'coldfusion mx hotfixes' and only 1 record was returned and it wasn't even close to what I wanted (it was the LiveDocs page for Verity Collections in MX 6.1)!!</p><p>Anyway, like I said, the link I pasted in sits nicely in my bookmarks to I can avoid the need to search.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Let's just hope that Macromedia implements a <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FcfmxUpdate.macromedia.com%3AJVS4sNRQDGh-kB_7_3Z8ptMmmn8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cfmxUpdate.macromedia.com">cfmxUpdate.macromedia.com</a> site that provides an rss feed of available updates and hotfixes, where a plugin in the CFIDE/Administrator reads the feed and checks against the current version fixes/updates installed.</p><p>Shouldn't be too hard, and it's something that really doesn't have to wait for the next version since the administrator supports customization.</p><p>Oh to be able to click a button "Check for Updates"</p></div>
