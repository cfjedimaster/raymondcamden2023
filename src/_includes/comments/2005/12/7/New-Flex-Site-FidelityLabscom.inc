		<div class="comment_text"><p>WOW...great job by your co-workers!!</p><p>The only thing that concerns me about Rich apps like this are that users aren't really used to interacting with a site the way that they do with these (like clicking on an accordion header to advance to a different section, etc).</p><p>Do you see this as an issue/concern, or do you think that just comes with the territory (in other words, users will eventually get used to these things the more they are exposed to them)?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For some of the items, like tabs, the user will at least recognize them from Windows app. Personally I tend to take a very critical view of users. If a user can't figure out an accordion, they shouldn't be using a computer. ;) That being said, my view is probably not the norm. :) I think most of these RIA type things will be ok for users.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I agree with you about users.  With an old employer, we (The IT giys) typically used the word 'user' when we really wanted to say 'moron'...of course thsi was only when one or more 'users' were about.</p><p>BTW - awesome job on the site....its very slick.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Very nice work!  A couple suggestions to pass along...</p><p>A user is more likely to navigate to the next "page" after browsing the current page, which would suggest paging links should be at the bottom rather than the top of the page in Financial Search results.  Also, the browser back button doesn't work, which is a big usability problem.  After going from page 1 to page 2 in the search, the user should be able to go back to page 1 using the browser's back button.  Thankfully Flex makes this pretty easy with the HistoryManager class.</p><p>For Mortgage Search, it seems "who has the best rates?" should be sorted by APR.  Also, I think the Purchase/Refinance/Home Equity navigation on the left would be a good candidate for accordion-style navigation rather than changing the location/order of the items as the user navigates.  I can hear users asking "Hey, where did the Purchase section go?" after they click on Home Equity.  Sliding up and down would make this more obvious, especially if the header for the selected pane appears selected.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Todd, Users are used to interacting with things that look like they can be interacted with in the way the things look like they should be interacted with.</p><p>Using an accordion to advance to a different section might not be the best use of an accordion, since the look of an accordion appears more non-linear.  Accordions are great for jumping between logical grouping of controls, but without some tweaking don't suggest 'start at the top and work your way down' behavior.</p><p>A wizard interface with next and previous buttons, on the other hand, would be quite obvious for advancing between sections.  (If the user should be able to jump ahead, you could use a list control or list of links to the right of the wizard.)</p><p>Users hardly notice a difference between well-designed rich apps and other web apps, except that they often notice things seem more fluid and responsive.  A poorly-design rich app, however, is much worse than a bad web app.</p><p>We're in an early stage of rich app development, similar to the early days of html where developers didn't always realize the blink tag wasn't a good idea.  But as best practices emerge, so too will a shift toward these fluid interfaces.  And it looks like the folks at Mindseye are helping move us in the right direction.</p><p>So to answer your question, I think it's less about users getting used to rich apps, and more about developers learning how to design them appropriately.</p></div>
