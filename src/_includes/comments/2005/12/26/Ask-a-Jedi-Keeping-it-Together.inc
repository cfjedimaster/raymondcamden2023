		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm sure there will be tons of "I use this" and "I use that" comments for issue tracking, but we use FogBugz from Joel Spolsky's Fog Creek Software and it's phenomenonal. It's written in ASP (and there's a PHP version available), but I can't say enough how intuitive and easy it is to use. It allows for bug, feature, and inquiry tracking, has built-in discussion boards, a screen capture tool, and lots more. Check out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fogcreek.com%2FFogBugz%2F%3AbZABpp3x_ThjoX4U1YZHMNPh8yE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/</a> for more info. And Ray, we bought FogBugz before there was even a Lighthouse, so don't take it personally!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>to be honest I used Dot Project <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dotproject.net%2F%3Ayqt4TpbROG87CvsuuiCmuP5yoJI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.dotproject.net/">www.dotproject.net/</a> for quite some time. it's great tool no to complext ideal suited for medium projects - but I might replace it with lighthouse pro.</p><p>The problem is alway the time -- so for small projects I just uses the great 'task' todolist in eclipse. its very handy and  very quick.</p></div>

What's nice about this OS X application is that it has a clipping service so when I come across something useful in blogs, I cann just select the text, go to Services and select the notebook page in which to stash this info.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We use Trac for our project management (bug tracker, release scheduling, etc) stuff, primarily because we use Subversion for version control.  Trac is designed to integrated with your SVN repository, which makes for some very powerful things.  For example, you can close a ticket (bug, issue, feature, etc.) as closed from your commit message, and Trac will not only add your note, but also cross reference the ticket against the changeset, so you can easily jump to the browser and see exactly what changed to close the ticket.</p><p>Both tools are very nice, but together they make a ridiculously powerful combination.  And they're both free (beer and speech), which is just icing on the cake.</p><p>For sharing code between projects, you use your version control system and vendor branches.  Basically you consider you shared code to be a software package that a third party (even though it's yourself) provides to you.  Then you can maintain customized version for each project that uses the code, but also easily merge changes into all dependant projects as the code evolves.  Every project has dependancies like this, even if it's just a couple utility custom tags, or a UDF or three.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We use TestTrack Pro from Seapine Software.  It's not the cheapest solution, but it is the most configurable of any product I've looked at over the years.  We use quite a bit of workflow to model our SDLC for data changes, bugs, and minor enhancements, and TestTrack allows us to completely customize that.  We also like that it's completely accessible via Web Services, although we currently aren't exploiting that as much as we should.</p><p>Combine issue tracking with source code control and configuration management, and you're well on your way to keeping things straight.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I kind of find it funny that your memory is going, going and gone. Reason is, that my memory has been going, going and gone as well.</p><p>Which is why I agree with you on the importance of documentation and issue/bug tracking/project tracking.</p><p>Just out of curiousity, what kind of daily routines do you all use to help manage your days, memories and tasks?</p><p>I'll share mine first..</p><p>I use to create a new daily task sheet to print and put on my monitor clipboard to help me remind what i needed to get done and worked on each day.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I do not do any work after work. I simply eat dinner and hangf out with the kids. (Although some days I just kinda zone out to rest my brain.) I do my "fun" work after the kids go to bed when I'm just watching TV with my wife. As for video games, I really don't play them very much. Maybe 2-3 hours per week. That's one reason I love the PSP so much. Easy to pick up and play for a few minutes. It's also why I like "lite" RPGs like X-Men Legends. I don't have to keep an intense story line in my head over 2-3 months.</p></div>
