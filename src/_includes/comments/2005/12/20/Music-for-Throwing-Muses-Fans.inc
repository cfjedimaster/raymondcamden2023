		<div class="comment_text"><p>FWIW, I am really enjoying the new Depeche Mode.  Though there aren't many "old style" songs on the new CD, they are playing quite a few old gems on the current tour (at the show I saw, we heard "a question of time", "everything counts", "enjoy the silence", "just can't get enough" and others).</p><p>I posted my "top 10 CDs of the year" on my blog a few weeks ago.  It's mostly things that qualify as "alternative" to 1 degree or another.  You might enjoy a band or 2 from here...</p><p>1. the mountain goats - the sunset tree<br>2. gratitude<br>3. depeche mode - playing the angel<br>4. mike park - north hangook falling<br>5. deathray - believe me<br>6. shelby sifers - yeah and i'm in love too<br>7. jack's mannequin - everything in transit<br>8. paul mccartney - chaos and creation in the backyard<br>9. the revolution smile - summer ever<br>10. garbage - bleed like me</p><p>honorable mentions:<br>the brodys - stuck<br>the kimberly trip - you'll get nothing and like it<br>eels - blinking lights and other revelations<br>the high speed scene - s/t</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome! Its been a few years since I last dusted off The Real Ramona.  I need to get that disc back in the rotation.  I don't know if you would be into underworld or not, but the guys sponsor a pretty cool station. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dirtyradio.net%2F%3AfQN-_yKxDqnOEdHaIceSMXS0cms&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dirtyradio.net/">http://www.dirtyradio.net/</a> you might find some new groves there.  Thanks again for mentioning Throwing Muses.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A word of advice if you've liked Coldplay, just pay for the tracks Talk and Speed Of Sound on iTunes and skip the whole album, the rest of it is nowhere near as good as their previous work.  For a group who's last album I liked so much, the new one was a major disappointment.  I got my wife the DM CD for xmas so we'll see how that one sounds...</p></div>
