		<div class="comment_text"><p>Congratulations to the grand prize winner Behrang.  I have to admit, that history feature was pretty sweet.</p><p>Ray, once again thanks for taking the time to do this.  I will take at least one thing away from this.......var scope.  However I do have one question about it,  do you var scope all variables that you are setting in the cfc.  Or just the first time you set them or initialize them?</p><p>Once again thanks and congrats to all the winners!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Var scoping is for a method/udf, not for a CFC per se. You var scope all variables created inside a method/udf. CF requires that you put var scope declarations in the beginning of the method/udf.</p></div>
