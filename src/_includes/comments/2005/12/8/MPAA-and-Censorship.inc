		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting point about 'selling out'.  I read an article in the Washington Post yesterday about 'independent' artists who are selling their music for commercials, TV shows, etc and making some good $$$$$.</p><p>One guy highlighted was the former lead singer of Husker Du (sp) - he made a Small fortune by allowing The OC to use one of his songs in an episode.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>With music distribution, it's really all about your connections. For the Ford Fusion launch site, most of the music on the site was provided by local Detroit bands that either had members who worked for, or were friends with people who worked for the ad agency. They were each paid pretty well for that I believe. That's just business... network properly, and half your job is done for you.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a sideline to this conversation..</p><p> Yes, music companies are unfair to artists.  But, as you said, it is up the artists to read, and understand, their contracts before signing them.</p><p> I'll also point out that only 1 in 10 bands will make money for a label.  We aren't talking about "U2 style success" we're just talking about enough to go beyond the break even point.</p><p> The music-label business model is a flawed, if you ask me.</p></div>
