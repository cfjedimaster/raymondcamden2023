		<div class="comment_text"><p>You said "the only folks who should be worried about the government 'spying' on them are the ones who have something to hide." This is nonsense. Recently the government has spied on nonviolent organizations opposed to the governments policies. I suppose this is ok with you. BTW, your RFID asschip implant is scheduled for Thursday and it keeps a record of excessive alcohol and illegal drugs, reported directly to your employer and insurance company. <br>It's a typical Internet debating tactic to take your opponents position to the other extreme ("You are obviously some kind of anarchist". "You obviously hate Christ"). It's the government and especially President Fascist Moron that I DON'T want "doing as they please". <br>BTW not get all factual or anything ("facts are stupid things" - Ronald "Diapers" Reagan) , but persistent cookies ARE illegal on government sites.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What do you mean "cookies are bad for your health"? This is propoganda spread by Hershey in an attempt to drive-up candy bar sales. Don't believe the hype, people.<br>Seriously though, you're absolutely right, Ray. I don't see what the big deal is? You can read their privacy policy (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsa.gov%2Fnotices%2Fnotic00001.cfm%29%3AeesCUUqFPBV3SDxcA372jxCcxIw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nsa.gov/notices/notic00001.cfm)">http://www.nsa.gov/notices/...</a> - it doesn't say that they promise not to use cookies or put permanent cookies on your machine... and I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to.  So long as they're using the information they gather within the boundries outlined on that page, I'm fine with it. In fact, most government websites do not claim not to use cookies.  That said, if you visit the official US Government Web Portal and read their privacy policy (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstgov.gov%2FAbout%2FPrivacy_Security.shtml%29%3A7fqkP4BhowyOwxkov58Vgwtn3lw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.firstgov.gov/About/Privacy_Security.shtml)">http://www.firstgov.gov/Abo...</a> it clearly states that they only use per-session cookies that are not ever written to disk... you'd think that all govt. agency sites would adhere to one standard and that the standard be that of the official govt. portal.  Of course, you'd also be wrong apparently.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>My apologies for continuing to add to the rant.</p><p>Jim,</p><p>I take exception to you words about Ronald Reagan, as well as most of the other things you wrote, but mostly President Reagan.  President Reagan will probably be remembered as the greatest President this country has ever seen.  Not because he was the smartest man on the planet, but because he understood his role and his authority.  President Reagan surrounded himself with the best men available and together they put down a Soviet threat.  In his role as President he portrayed a vision of hope and prosperity that positively influenced the entire world.  People forget that is was during the Reagan era that humans probably had their greatest social awakening in history.  LiveAid, FarmAid, Feed the World, the end of Apatheid, Perestroika, and the collapse of the wall, all took place or had their foundation established during the Reagan Administration.  Unfortunately, his 8 years came to an end before the virus, known as the Soviet Union was completely eradicated and which, based on recent news events, may be coming back with a more resistant strain.</p><p>As for the cookie issue, the reason government initially took the stance on not using cookies was solely based on individual privacy.  They feared that Americans would feel like their privacy was being invaded if the government placed a cookie on their machine.  The fact that every other unscrupulous entity on the planet could use them is irrelevant.  As for me, I want some thin mints from the Girl Scouts (they're not facist are they?).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Steve, in your cantonizing of the most useless, dumbest president we've ever had, you missed the part where he developed a vaccine for AIDS and solved the problem of the homeless. And redistributed wealth. And fixed the environment. And redeveloped astrology as a science. Not to mention defeating Nazi Germany in WWII single-handed. (wait, he never served in WWII).</p><p>Reagan:<br>"Many of them are, duh, uh, homeless by choice. Yeah, thats it".<br>"I often depend on the scientific predictions of Jeanne Dixon to make foreign policy decisions. After all, astrology is, you know, a science, kinda. And Mommy likes her."<br>"Trickle-down economics means the superrich will maybe throw some change at the homeless.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read this article also on Slashdot. My first and only reaction is "what is the big deal?". I don't see why people are making a big deal because the NSA is leaving cookies on their computers. No matter what browser you are using, you can either set it up to remove all cookies from your drive when you close the browser or you can tell it to block, even prompt you to accept cookies. Futhermore, with free software like CCleaner, you can have it run once a night and remove them.</p><p>This is obviously a way to use FUD to get people in an uproar. Unfortunatly people rather be sucked into FUD then use their heads and realize that this isn't a big deal in the first place.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, people can get hysterical about something they know nothing about.  I envision articles in public magazines such as Newsweek that will now detail how to turn cookies off (as opposed to the trade journals that you and I read).<br>So we as programmers need to be even more ready to handle users who have turned their cookies off.</p><p>I thought that EVEN SESSION VARIABLES use cookies to maintain their state from one page to the next.  The only other option is to pass the cfid/cftoken in the FORM scope or the URL scope, which is rather like lugging your baggage around with you from room to room.  You can put all your luggage into one suitcase with the JSESSION variable, but that doesn't eliminate having to carry it to every form.</p><p>Ray, <br>Q: is it true that EVEN SESSION VARIABLES need to have cookies enabled?</p></div>
