		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have been a fan since season 1 episode 1.  I've seen them all.  I would be very dissappointed if they got rid of the 24 hour premise.  We would not be able to joke about ridiculous timeline inconsistancy the morning after each episode airs.  Like last year... they called Chloe back after firing her and 5 minutes later she was in the office.  I assume she lives around the corner.</p><p>They could never have the show take place in NYC because when Jack hopped in a car to run to the airport, they would need 2 full episode to follow him sitting in bumper to bumper traffic.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Patrick, I don't agree. Well, I agree that the quick time frame makes for good drama. I'm not saying to get rid of that per se, but the whole notion of everything wrapping up in 24 hours is just getting old. You can _still_ make it very fast paced w/o it being in real time. Let's face it - the real time thing is a writing trick. It's good once - twice - maybe even three times, but it needs to end.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's a bit funny watching it on DVD, as the time is more compressed and the inconsistencies really stand out. Like when Tony got shot in the neck. An hour after surgery, he's back at work, though a bit weak. A couple hours later he seems in full health, bandage off with just a scar. Hahaha.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's all about the tension!  Granted I think the story and show would work if stretched over months (in TV time, example Prison Break) but the fact that *all* this crap is happening in 24 hours is incredible.  Imagine how you would feel in Bauers place if 1 full 24 hour stretch was as explosive and action packed.  Hell, I can barely stay awake for 24 hours, much less think intelligently.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah - I was into 24 big time for the first couple seasons, which says a lot considering I don't really like to watch TV, but the idea has gotten really old. I'm a little sick of Jack Bauer - they should have killed him last season and brought a new heavy weight actor in for this, and I'm tired of the US - they ought to shoot a season on location somewhere else. Personally, I think a season in Israel would be cool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is no way they would touch something so sensitive. Shoot, wasn't it two years ago when they refused to name the nation that had initiated the attack? I remember it was so silly since they kept dancing around it and never actually saying the name of the country. (I _think_ it was 2 years ago, it may have been 3.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know how sensitive it would be. I mean, last season they had no problem identifying the Chinese embassy, right? And since the Chinese want Bauer imprisoned, a season over there would be pretty cool. The one thing I never understood about the 24 hour format is how Jack and company have the energy level they do when they 1) don't eat and 2) don't relieve themselves. Let's be honest here -- how do you concentrate when your either really hungry or really constipated! I'm waiting for Jack to finally just say "I'll be there in a minute. I have to hit the head." Now that's quality TV.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having worked in a profession (EMS) where, from time to time, we were required to work a 24 hour shift, I can appreciate how they are able to stay focused for 24 hours in a row.  Never underestimate the power of adrenaline.</p><p>Now the part about eating and relieving ones' self, I couldn't agree more.  I'd even settle for seeing them come out of the bathroom once or twice, or even throwing a Big Mac wrapper into the trash when the show comes back from commercial.  I think subtle stuff like that would appease a lot of people who have similar gripes.  I chalk it up to the writers/directors/producers not really giving their audience enough credit.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Do you really expect the writers to convince you that Jack saves the world and recks his own life in 24 hours, not once, not twice, but FIVE TIMES?</p><p>The first time I was willing to believe it. I thought they did a good job of making him look sleep deprived without belaboring the point.</p><p>But in order to accept that there even was a second season, I had to suspend my disbelief with respect to the 24 hour period. The less I'm reminded that everything happens in real time the better.</p><p>So in that sense I agree with Ray. The real time element doesn't help anymore. But it's a legacy the writers and viewers have to live with. If you're going to throw out the 24 hours / real time set-up, you might as well throw out the characters and start a whole new show (Prison Break).</p><p>Patrick</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>24 is the best show on TV, but I agree with Ray on the 24-hour concept.  I think they should rename the show; is CTU too close to CSI?  The one premise I would like to see them continue with is the single case that lasts an entire season.  Although I am not tired of the US (sorry Simon), I am tired of L.A. being the epicenter of every terrorist plot under the sun. Obviously money is an issue.</p><p>Jack Bauer is on the big screen in "24 The Motion Picture" aka "The Sentinel" (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.movie-list.com%2Fs%2Fsentinel.html%29%3Ae8R81B5KPyR2dT4e2aclki4vXag&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.movie-list.com/s/sentinel.html)">http://www.movie-list.com/s...</a>. Kiefer has a different name in this motion picture , but from the previews he hasn't had to challenge his acting skills much for this role.  Include Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, and Eva Longoria.</p></div>
