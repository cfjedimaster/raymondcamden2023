		<div class="comment_text"><p>I brought this issue to Steven Erat's attention about 2 months ago.  I think it's a shame that the Admin API does not work on J2EE deployments as that appears to be the preferred method of deployment these days.</p><p>What's worse is that there are no plans (that I've heard of) to fix this in a future release.  Macromedia / Adobe is saying that this is a 'documentation flaw' and have now corrected it with a technote.  Apparently, if you deploy using the J2EE method, then you won't be able to fully utilize the Admin API.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was using this method of creating datasources dynamically: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.creative-restraint.co.uk%2Fblog%2Findex.cfm%3Fmode%3Dentry%26entry%3D7B83C13D-EEF8-5BAE-8195007923F93910%3AlhbrKOsHBsHEdqEIfHjZKxFBOlo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=7B83C13D-EEF8-5BAE-8195007923F93910">http://www.creative-restrai...</a> and ran into this problem. The solution only has a work around for that one method, any one know how I can create a datasource dynamically?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry! Please disregard, creating datasources works fine this was my fault as my login wasn't being called properly, this does work fine, I just assumed that my bug was macromedia's.</p></div>
