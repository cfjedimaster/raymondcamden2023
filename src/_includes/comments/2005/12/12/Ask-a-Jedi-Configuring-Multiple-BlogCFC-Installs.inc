		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had the requirement to install multiple blogs on the same server each with a different database BUT not to copy the client folder for each new blog. I had to use one set of code for all. So if there were any modifications later it wouldn't have to be done in 3 or 4 different blogs. I moded the app passing the blog name as url parameter to accomplish this.</p><p>I went even as far as to build an administration piece to modify the INI file from within the application.</p><p>Thanks Ray for a nice application.</p></div>
