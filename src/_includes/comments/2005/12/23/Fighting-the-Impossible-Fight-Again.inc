		<div class="comment_text"><p>You are better off spending your time improving your blacklisting on your TB vs. complaining to a webhost.  Creating splogs, fake blogs created for the purpose of link farming, is easy, and takes little effort to get good content.  With the proliferation of RSS, it's cake to use a combination of RSS parsing from legitamte sites as well as screenscraping from others, organize the content onto various blogs, and paste it all into a blog template resulting in a multitude of blogs that continually feed eachothers page rank.</p><p>You cannot win against the splogs, but you can prevent them from using your page rank by improving your TB's anti-spam effectivness.</p></div>

I'm glad we got it cleared up that <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FWeblogs.us%3AL3doBGeqNqYhFky749by__g29NQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Weblogs.us">Weblogs.us</a> does &lt;b&gt;not host&lt;/b&gt; or have anything to do with the spammer (other than they use a WordPress theme design that <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FWeblogs.us%3AL3doBGeqNqYhFky749by__g29NQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Weblogs.us">Weblogs.us</a> sponsors.) I look forward to your updated entry that reflects that info.</p><p>Good luck in your fight against spam.</p><p>Respectfully,<br>-JD</p></div>
