		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I like Flash Forms, but I definitely wouldn't _stop_ using LHP if you removed them.  I'd love to see the result of tying this into a Flex 2 app, but that's because everything I'm doing now I'm building the Admin UI's in Flex 2 when possible, even when it means installing a few copies of the Debug Player for 8.5.  And as far as the CrystalTech issue Dave is having goes, I host some of my sites with CT, and haven't had any trouble with Flash Forms yet, though I can honestly say it's been quite a while since I've tried using Flash Forms on one of their servers, I switched to HostMySite almost 6 months ago now for all my new sites.</p><p>- Zach</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interestingly I run LHP on 3 systems, all Windows using IIS and have never run into the "if file exists" bug.  One is even the vanilla install of IIS with no configuration changes.  @ others are production environments.  What causes this error anyway?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It appears that the "check if file exists" problem is two fold.  Flash Forms make reference to .SWF files that don't physically exist. Somehow IIS (if the "check" flag is on), steps in before hand and if custom error handling is turned on, redirects to the custom error handler, before CF ever gets an opportunity to "serve" the SWF content.</p><p>At least in my hosted environment, I am told that I can either have the "check for file existence" on and have a custom 404 page, or off, and be stuck with the CF 404 handler, but I can't have both capabilities.</p><p>I have toyed with Flash Forms on my local dev box with no problems, but in my hosted environment they don't work - neither does CFGraph.</p><p>Dave</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, lemme throw a log on this fire... I would love to use lighthouse pro at my work but the two things that have stopped me is the required cf7 and the flash forms on everything (which i thought were a little slow sometimes for basic stuff... with the loader bars and all). So for me it would actually be better if it didnt use the flash forms. Though the option to have them would be nice too... especially on the report pages.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, to be honest i really like your use of flash forms but some of my clients using the system haven't been able to use it.  Now I know you not pro Ajax from you post but i think this would be a great move forward.  I'm about to publish how you can use Ajax via Tab browsing (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.succor.co.uk%3Ar3FIT7AMhETvhxgVC5LyU6wYV_M&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.succor.co.uk">http://www.succor.co.uk</a>) which will alow you to load content via an ajea call.  This is really simple and it will allow you to acces tasks on request.  I belive that this will be quicker than flash forms (although i happy to be corrected).  More people will be enabled to use javascript than Flash.</p><p>I do apolgies for my typos and rambaling but it's 4:15am GMT.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Update:</p><p>I've removed the Flash Forms from everything but the issue view on a project. So far I'm loving it. The app seems a lot more "springy". I'm also fixing bugs and adding features. So for example, when you logon, your home page now shows some quick stats, specifically regarding your open issues, so you can see the general health of your queue.</p><p>Something else that will change, I will get rid of the 'view' issue and simply link to an edit detail for a bug. Mails that get sent out for issues will have this link.</p><p>There will also be a print format for all open issues as well.</p></div>
