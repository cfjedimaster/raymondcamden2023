		<div class="comment_text"><p>When I returned home tonight after a day of visiting friends, I found that TalkingTree had what I believe is a 20 minute DDOS attack from about 10 or more different IP addresses that didn't have much in common when I searched WHOIS.</p><p>Then I had had a rash of referral spam from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcybertechsoftshop.com%3AXIJyvBek404N-7dvnz1lWsEzF_Y&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cybertechsoftshop.com">cybertechsoftshop.com</a>, which lists the founders address, phone, and email.  I was already ticked off enough that I wrote the founder Lee Asher a letter requesting that he stop spamming my blog.  Not that it will have any real effect on spam load, but it made me feel better.</p><p>Bah! Humbug!</p></div>
