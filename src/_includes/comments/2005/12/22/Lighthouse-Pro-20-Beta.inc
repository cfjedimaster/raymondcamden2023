		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray. Would be nice if the table can automatically remember its sorting order (store in a cookie), name of issue left-aligned rather than justified, option for non-US date format defined in defaults.cfm (dd-mm-yy), and a "remember" button next to the filters so it saves them in a cookie as a persistant filter. Also a "clear" button to reset it.</p><p>Would still very much like extra Types such as "task" or "modification". Just something so I can assign someone a new task instead of calling it a bug or enhancement which it is not.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>There is a bug when deleting an item when only one item is listed. This is fixed in source. No need to post a bug report on that if yhou come across it. Gary, I liked your ideas - will see about that post release. But since it has been a good week and only suggestions have come in, I'm going to release it this week, then look at your guys suggestions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>nevermind.  my fault.  well, sort of.  I didn't refresh my application variables, so the components were looking at the old application.components (version 1.0).  Or, I could have just changed the application name to something different like "LighthousePro2" in Application.cfc.</p><p>problem solved.  very nice app, Ray.</p><p>I liked the Flash Forms at first, but when I was using it more and needed to do quick updates and move around faster within the app, I realized the HTML version is much better at that.  Good call.</p></div>
