		<div class="comment_text"><p>I sent in that topic. I planned to show a CFFUNCTION built and explained and then move it into a CFC and explain that. I'm rather unhappy that they gave it to someone else (though i'm a bit molified that they gave it to you). Advanced RegEx and Error handling are ok, but....</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>wow.  not too too impressed with the lineup of sessions, the speakers are all good, but the lineup of sessions seems a bit ... well, the same as last year... and i know that there are not too many ways to skin a cat... so, i guess its just a symptom of the ease of use of the language and its functionality.  and im not exactly sure what else i would suggest either, just seems a bit "like a lot of other sessions" from previous conferences.</p><p>however, it wont stop me from going :)</p></div>
