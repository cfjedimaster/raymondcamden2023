Hell, if you wanted to build your own Mame machine, the cabinet and monitor would be worth that much alone... i'll be interested to hear how these things get hacked.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh my, brings back memories - I started drooling after arcade machines ever since that episode of Silver Spoons too.  Of course my parents banned me from watching it as I started immitating the kid, but that's a different story.  Its almost tempting too....</p></div>

Donkey Kong, Joust, Galaga, Defender, Defender 2, you name it, we had it! I mean ALL of em. heeheehee.</p><p>Man, I remember the first one he bought was ... yes .... ASTEROID! lol! Sat at that game for hours and hours. Sheeesh.</p><p>Ahhhhh ..... those were the good ol' days. :)</p><p>Will</p></div>
