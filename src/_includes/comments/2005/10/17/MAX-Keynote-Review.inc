		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the update.</p><p>I really like to hear this from Macromedia's management.  They have a superior platform to Microsoft by many accounts.  Not only referring to Flash vs "sparkle", but Coldfusion when compared to .NET.  I used to program in .NET and don't touch it anymore where compared to ColdFusion.  CF is more robust, and more enjoyable to create in.  For now, Microsoft enjoys a marketing advantage only.  I believe many developers will begin to understand the power of ColdFusion as the merger with ADBE comes to pass.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholtsblog.blogspot.com%2F2005%2F09%2Fmacromedia-studio-8-released-sparkle.html%3AQLJX42oZrycLjBm5ILh8tBSuJVM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://holtsblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/macromedia-studio-8-released-sparkle.html">http://holtsblog.blogspot.c...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interestingly though, Microsoft doesn't claim to be a "software development" company. Various execs have been quoted as saying "Microsoft is, first and foremost, a marketing company." I find that pretty indicative of their practices, in terms of putting out sub-par tools and marketing them down our throats. Nobody ever got fired for buying Blue has been changed to Nobody ever got fired for buying "Bill".  Now, that isn't to say that there aren't some features in Sparkle I've seen that I haven't said "If that actually works like that, I'd like to see it in Flash. After Effects style timeline, for instance. :-)</p></div>
