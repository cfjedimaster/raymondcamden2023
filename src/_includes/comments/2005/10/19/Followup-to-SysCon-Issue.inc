		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray: A comment and a question...</p><p>Comment: Looks good to me.</p><p>Question: Are "friendly URIs" the default in BlogCFC? If not, you might want to warn folks about the murky relationship between query-strings and Trackback.</p><p>Basically, 6A never got around to clarifying how URIs are to be treated inside the autodiscovery RDF. It seems obvious (to me) that it should be treated like normal XML, even if most tools parse it with regex. Unfortunately, I've come across at least two TB implementations that handle a URI like this:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%2Findex.cfm%3Ffoo%3Dbar%26foobar%3Dfubar%3AoJmLBT7BQFkyeFs1h9wf2OkD8Kk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://foo.com/index.cfm?foo=bar&amp;foobar=fubar">http://foo.com/index.cfm?fo...</a></p><p>...in different ways. One expects the ampersand to be escaped, the other doesn't. And you can't officially declare one of them The Right Way, because the spec is silent.</p><p>So all things being equal, folks should opt for friendly URIs or expect occasional incompatibility. Except for Trackback spammers, who _always_ seem to get it right. :D</p></div>
