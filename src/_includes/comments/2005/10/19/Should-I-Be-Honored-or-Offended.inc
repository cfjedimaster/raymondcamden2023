		<div class="comment_text"><p>Dude, unlike some blathering, blogging, idiots, you actually pack value into your publishings.  The value-add seems worthy of more than an honorable mention, although you get ample credit for your work (cfdj isn't passing your work off as exclusively theirs).  Since you're noted as being an editor of cfdj, is there some sense of entitlement that cfdj may feel due to your close working relationship?  Whatever the case, at the east, a "reprinted with permission" is due, once said permission hs been sought and granted.  Or am I wrong?  You could offer a CC limited use license for folks wanting to re-print your work, or maybe even a more strict intellectual property protection of your content and mindshare that would force folks to have to license your work if they want to leverage your content in their site(s).  Maybe not, who knows?  I know I've just had one-too-many caffeinated soda pops tonite, so disregard the rambled; it's the cola talkin.  You rock, dude.</p></div>

But really in that article, it's obvious that it's your material in the first place. Ah well... In any case, at the end of the day you're more famous and make more money than that dude.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been doing a lot of copyright research for some digital projects we've been starting...even without a copyright notice on your blog, it is still copyrighted at the moment of inception. Placing that content in the "CFDJ Stories" as being developed for CFDJ (and they now claim it under their copyright). In fact, you may want to contact a lawyer... beyond the unethical editorial practice, they are actually stealing intellectual property; and as someone who makes income from authoring books, republishing your material (something not expressly meant for journal/magazine publication) without your express written consent jeopardizes part of your livelyhood. Have you talked to Simon about it?</p></div>

I would check your contract with them, like someone said above, they may have the right to do this. Either way its shady, and not very above board. Although, I would imagine it was an oversite on someones part, as it seems CFDJ has been run by the seat of its pants in the past.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow. I can't imagine anyone thinking "Go ahead and publish that. Ray won't care."</p><p>The article says that you are the co-technical editor for the magazine. Does that give them some special rights to anything you publish on your blog? I think not.</p><p>Even thought it appears that you have a prior relationship with these guys, it still smells a bit fishy. I hope they have a good explaination.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I notice that as of Saturday evening, the page does not offer the complete article but rather a single paragraph introducing it and a note that:</p><p>"The full blog entry [hyperlinked] is well worth looking at and CFDJ heartily recommends it."</p><p>Ray, is this different from what it was when you (and the rest commenting above) observed it? Does it perhaps represent a change they did? Have they changed all such posts this way?</p><p>If so, then I'd think what they've done (in this form) to be not so bad at all. As it appears now, it looks more like any other blog entry that points to another, and since they may drive lots of folks to your ad-revenue-generating blog, that would seem a good thing. :-)</p><p>Still, I realize that since it's a magazine, some may still feel it not really the same as "one blog pointing to another". But it definitely seems less a worry than it did originally, right? Or is even this link as it is what you and others were referring to? If so, then I just don't quite see the concern. (I am myself no longer involved with sys-con other than as an occasional writer, so I had no connection with and wasn't even aware of this</p></div>
