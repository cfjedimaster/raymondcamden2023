		<div class="comment_text"><p>i have two comments: First, Thank God you're doing a series that examines how to do simple stuff, but do it right... I can hardly wait to see some "Here's the full-blown Ray Camden would do it this way". The second comment is I don't think I could take the criticism but I'm sure glad other people can because I don't have any formal training and I'd be making some of the very same mistakes without some solid instruction such as CFWACK and blogs like yours.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only thing I would say is that 1 and 100 should not be a guess. We know that 1 is the low number and 100 is the high number. You should guess a number between these two. If you specified something different in your rules for the contest then I apologize. On this example though the first time I ran the test the number turned out to be 100. This is just me throwing my two cents in so don’t yell at me :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Another option to avoid replicating the form is to put the form code in a separate file and use cfinclude to include it as needed.  I think this could be a valid solution to solve the "code replication" problem in this example.</p><p> I am not a fan of self-submitting forms.  In my experience, they can make the form overly complex because there is a lot of different code for different purposes, plus additional conditional logic to figure out what the "state" the page is in.</p><p> In this example, we'd only have two 'states' so it isn't so bad.  I've often seen all the "CRUD" code in a single form.  I've seen mult-step forms implemented all in a single page.  Things like that can get rather confusing.</p><p> I like pages to have a single purpose, and will often separate the "form input" page from the "form processing" page.</p><p> I know a lot of people don't agree with me on this, though.  Web Forms in ASP.NET are a prime example.  Fusebox also uses a "submit onto myself" technique.  The use of code encapsulation (CFCs, UDFs, Custom Tags) can help to greatly simplify the processing code</p></div>
