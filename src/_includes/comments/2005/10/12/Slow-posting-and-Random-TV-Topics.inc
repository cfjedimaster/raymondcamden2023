		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lost is incredible... have you heard the internet ramblings about how Desmond's area looked entirely different up until the second that they blasted the hatch? They never showed his face until the blast, then the record skips, and all the sudden everything is dark and dusty and old looking, also people have screenshots of the record player changing models drastically (metal to wood) and lamps changing and moving. Could just be a bad continuity error, or something more elaborate.</p></div>

Long ago, I gave up trying to figure out shows, basically becasue I suck at it and get obsessed with it. I would rather juts wait patiently for my weekly dose and tehn go about my business ;)</p></div>
