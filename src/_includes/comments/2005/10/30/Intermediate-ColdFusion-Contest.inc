		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm curious what constitutes the clasification of "ColdFusion Ninja"?  I know it's difficult to quantify but if you've got some guidelines it might help.  By the way - I've got a challenge unlike any other for you... but we'll talk about that off-list.  I will say that it's a "ninja-only" type contest and that I'd be shocked if you got any entries... I'm developing it myself and am planning to release it as a "learn by example" tool, as a fun play thing, and as an open source app. that others can help to refine and make better. More on that later (way later) on my blog but it's something you and I might want to team up on as a kind of "master challenge". BTW - make sure you keep Hal out of this contest - development skills aside, his prowess as a card player should disqualify him. Sorry, Hal ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Matt - the -next- contest is for the CF Ninja. ;)</p><p>Simon - Well - it's up in the air I mean - if you feel like you know CF and are 'decent' at it, I'd probably consider that intermediate. You and I would NOT be considered intermediate. As for Hal, I don't think I'd even let him in on the advanced contest - it wouldn't be fair. :)</p><p>Matt - Are you joking? I certainly don't plan on reselling any of this, but as before, the code WILL be shared.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've certainly offered bigger and better prizes fr CFDJ - it didn't seem to have much impact on the number or quality of entries (I had 0 entries the last two contests).  That said, I can help you secure a "bigger" prize next go-around, as it seems more people respond to contests held by blogs than via the megazine (I'm still surprised I didn't get any takers for my last 2 contests). Ping me off-list for more on talk about prize and the next contest.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know this is a cf contest and someone already asked if we can use javascript, but I have way too much javascript going on here. I cant figure out another way to do, my goal was not to leave the screen ie no form submission and I just dont see it possible without tons of javascript.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>i guess im just not of the opinion that page reloads are a bad thing.  i wouldnt totally rule out ANY javascript, as its VERY useful, and certainly has its place, but i wouldnt focus too much on it, being that its a cf contest.  thats all.  good luck :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>dan -</p><p>my feeling (for whatever it's worth) is that this is a CF contest.  Yeah, you could do it with no page reloads...but now it's a JS app...not CF.</p><p>Ideally, I get what you're saying about page refreshes.  If I were building this as a commercial app (because the world needs another blackjack game), I would probably want to see it in JS (or AJAX), or even Flash/Flex.</p><p>But the gist of the contest here is to see how we all do it using CF.</p><p>err...um...now that i scroll up and read a bit...yeah, what Weeg said :)</p><p>so far the only JS i've added to mine is some client side validation to make sure the bet amount is numeric (and less than the total player amount).</p><p>&lt;/ $0.02&gt; :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Charlie -</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. After reading your post I can agree 100%. I guess when faced with a problem I am always look for the best solution and not the right one, something I need to get better at :)</p><p>Mine will be done by the weekend, good luck everyone.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When you say cards should be dealt one at a time, are you you meaning that there should be some interaction when each card is dealt? Or are you saying that behind the scenes each card is dealt one at a time?</p><p>In my app, the initial 4 cards are shown at once (1 dealer card face down, of course), but they dealt behind the scenes one at a time. I think this is what you meant, but just to clarify.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Yes - what I meant is that you give one card to the player, then the dealer, then player, then dealer. You don't have to _show_ that, it just needs to happen that way, to be fair. (And I don't really care if dealer gets a card first.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If I were writting this as a commercial app, I'd probably avoid using Ajax.  The prospects of what you could do with something like Greasemonkey make me shudder.  All the checks you would have to perform to avoid cheating would make me stay as far away from JS as possible.</p></div>
