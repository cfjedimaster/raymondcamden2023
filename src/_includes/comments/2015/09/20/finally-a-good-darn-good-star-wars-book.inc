		<div class="comment_text"><p>Given the choice between Aftermath and Heir to Empire which would you <br>pick as the book to be describing what happened after ROTJ?</p><p> I'd pick the Thrawn series myself for the main reason that reading <br>it felt like Star Wars.  Aftermath didn't - it wasn't  a bad book it <br>just wasn't a good one.  It had a story that had enough Star Wars <br>ingredients to get interest but didn't deliver.  I get they are trying <br>to reboot the franchise but this time period could be all about the <br>characters we grew up with (the section with Han/Chewie was the most <br>interesting and I wanted a book about that) and finding out what happens<br> - giving us older folks a bridge to the new world coming out soon - and<br> yes I"m looking forward to that as well (and can't wait to take my <br>daughter to see her very first Star Wars movie in the theaters).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to be honest and say while I remember *really* liking Heir to the Empire, it has been so long I can't really say which I like better.</p><p>To your point about the characters... I don't know. I really liked the new characters, and I'm happy to see non-core characters being introduced and being kinda cool. If you read the Shattered Empire series (well, only one comic has come out so far), you see something similar. The big guys are secondary characters and the focus is on unknowns. I'm really digging that.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Btw, as an aside, apparently "Smuggler's Run" is supposed to be real darn good. New book, focused on Han/Chewie, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read Aftermath two months back and appreciate the writing. The elements were properly balanced by Wendig.  I can't wait for the next two books in the series to come out.</p></div>
