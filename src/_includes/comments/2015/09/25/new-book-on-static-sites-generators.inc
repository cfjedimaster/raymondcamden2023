		<div class="comment_text"><p>Earlier today I was searching for a refresher on Server Side Includes, an ancient Microsoft technology. I need to output 50,000 articles (pages) a year based around a template and allow them all to be amended if any information, or the template, changes. The key requirement is not to consume any database resource, except at the moment the files are generated. Static pages can be very useful - including consuming static pages as includes. :-)</p></div>
