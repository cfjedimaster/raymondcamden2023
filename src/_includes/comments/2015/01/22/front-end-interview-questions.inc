I'd be interested in even the questions you didn't put on this list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I just went through a bunch of interviews with various companies.  I can only describe them as Marathons.  One company was 5 phone interviews 3 of which were technical, then it would have been a full day of onsite interviews.  Another company was 1 phone interview followed by 6 onsite interviews one right after the other.  Then there were mini projects I had to do in prep for onsites.  I'm glad I got hired when I did cause I was almost burnt out going through the process and I couldn't imagine starting over again with another company.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To me the best interview is done when pair programing with the candidate. I typically use the js-assessment repo from Rebecca Murphey <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frmurphey%2Fjs-assessment%3AF0jUWVUXWEca9lBkMQJ14QNGX0o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment">https://github.com/rmurphey...</a></p><p>And I focus on having the candidate speak through what he/she is thinking in order to determine the level of knowledge in JS at least.</p></div>
