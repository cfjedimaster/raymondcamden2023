		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Raymond, I for one agree that we need more articles below the "ninja" level and I think you're doing a great job :-)<br>The stuff I read on your blog is something that actually brings me further in my day to day development. I also read the so called "Rockstar/Ninja" stuff but it has far less practical value to me. (hope it will have one day ;-))</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well done, Raymond! I totally agree that 201 level JS stuff is needed. I've done very little JS unit testing myself, but know I need to. I'm relatively new to task runners as well, though I do use them in trivial ways daily (live reload, local server, etc). Thanks!</p></div>
