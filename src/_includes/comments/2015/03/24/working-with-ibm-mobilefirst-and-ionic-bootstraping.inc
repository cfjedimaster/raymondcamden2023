		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am. I know some people have said that if you move all your calls (well calls related to device stuff) to services you can just listen for deviceready in there instead. To me that just seems weird.</p><p>What boggles my mind though is how no one seems to talk about this issue. When I first started learning Ionic, I immediately ran into it, and it feels like something you would see often in the forums, but that doesn't seem to be the case.</p><p>If you look at the examples on ngcordova (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fngcordova.com%2Fdocs%2Fplugins%2Fcamera%2F%29%3A09qqOIfiRt6SGQsSPlyxOnvvAf0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/camera/)">http://ngcordova.com/docs/p...</a> they have event listeners in the controller, which again, seems wrong.</p></div>
