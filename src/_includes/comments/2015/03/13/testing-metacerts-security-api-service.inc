		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sweet little app Raymond. Thanks for taking the time to give it a try. I'm delighted you like it. Simplicity is key.</p><p>I just want to add that when we do add categories, the API won't change so developers won't need to make any updates - aside from the parsing code so their app knows what to do with the response.</p></div>
