		<div class="comment_text"><p>A few of my co-workers and I have been playing this game at lunch on Fridays for the past few weeks and it's really fun. Definitely takes a few runs to really wrap your head around all the rules (the instruction booklet does not really explain things that well IMO), but once you have it down it plays really well. Interested to know how you're enjoying it after a few more games!</p></div>
