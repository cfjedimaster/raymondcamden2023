		<div class="comment_text"><p>As an aside, I was talking on IM with the person who emailed me about this and I made the point that you may not want to add the warning unless the user actually interacts with the form. You can add a blur/change/etc type handler to input fields and only add the beforeunload listener then. That way if the user hits the page and has no interest in doing the form, you don't annoy them when they click away. If folks need a demo of that, just ask.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that is the key difference. It's not begging to fill out the form but a positive UX feature telling them "hey you started this, but you didn't finish it. You sure you're done?" Kind of reminds me of a server at a restaraunt asking if you'd like the rest of the meal wrapped up instead of just up and taking it away as you leave.</p><p>Facebook comes to mind and it might be the first place I saw this idea put to use. You can start to enter a comment but if you try to navigate away, it prompts you. </p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm. I'm not sure. I don't have this sample code anymore, but if you modify the beforeunload func to include the event object, and then examine it, you may see the destination value, and if so, you could selectively do stuff.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did some basic testing, and as far as I know, it isn't supported. However, instead of a generic 'beforeunload' func, it would be trivial to listen for anchor links where the target matches website2. I'd take over those clicks.</p></div>
