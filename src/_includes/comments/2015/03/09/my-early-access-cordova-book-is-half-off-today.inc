		<div class="comment_text"><p>Brilliant, I didn't know about your book or the early offer. Just ordered it. Thank you. I look forward to the "deploying to the stores" section. I want to start on a WinPhone 8 version of an app but it doesn't seem as simple as Android and isn't as well documented or blogged as the (complex) IOS  process. i.e. how to install an app for testing on a physical phone. Good luck with the book, I hope you sell loads.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to be honest and say Windows Phone is *not* covered in that section. I'm doing Android and iOS only for that chapter. I'm more than willing to investigate and write it up in the future though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Matt, thank you for pointing me to your blog entry. I do indeed use PGB so your guide will be very useful. Ray, I'll read anything you write so your Android/iOS coverage will be dandy. :-) I think Matt covers the WinPhone bits I got stuck on. I haven't ready any of your book yet, Ray, but it would be nice if it covered how to do push notifications. :-) There are quite a few push providers and a few of them provide Cordova plugins.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gary, I feel like I'm batting a no hitter for you here. (I probably screwed up the baseball metaphor.) No, I do not cover push. That - to me - feels like something that has been covered in quite a few blog posts.</p><p>For my book - I tried to bring together the basic rules - the principles - of Cordova development together in one package. There's a lot of material out there and it's a bit disconnected. I think the strength of my book is that you have it in one place, and I focus on the guidelines, not necessarily a cookbook of "How do I do X in Cordova." Don't get me wrong, I think a cookbook is a great idea (Matt Gifford wrote one a few years ago), but that's not what I'm trying to achieve in my book</p><p>Make sense?</p><p>And - as an honest statement - if you buy my book and do NOT feel like I accomplished that, *please* do not hold back. Be honest. Let me know.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's okay Ray. I'm sure there are lots of gems and nuggets in your book that will be useful. I've bought it so I will definitely read it. Thanks. :-)<br>BTW, your blog doesn't pick up Gravatar avatars when posting as a guest.</p></div>
