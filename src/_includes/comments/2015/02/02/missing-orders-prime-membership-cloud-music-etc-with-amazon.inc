		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool. The only reason I can think of for Amazon allowing multiple accounts using same email/different password is for all the grandparents (read: senior citizens) who use a shared email address. </p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Today I saw this problem on my work PC, fat-fingered the password so I tried an older one and viola I was in. But recent orders and Prime options disappeared. Instead of going to my Prime features, there was a button to start my free 30-day trial of Prime!</p><p>So weird that when I created the Prime account, the non-prime version stayed in limbo. Once I logged back into the Prime account, things I ordered as a non-Prime member were not there.</p><p>On the android amazon shopping app, things got really weird. I went to look at the account there, which I had already been logged in from when I did the password right. Prompted me for a password when I wanted to look at account settings and I put the old one in. Saw a picture on a part I'd recently ordered, but clicked on "your orders", empty going back to pre-Prime days. Image of Part bought recently persisted when clicking on the amazon logo at top to go back to home screen. Would not let me log out of the non-prime account, I had to uninstall.reinstall the app to login to the Prime acct.</p><p>Obviously they should fix this and only allow one account and one password per email address. What if I reset password while in the non-Prime version of my account? How would I ever recover a lost password to the Prime account?</p></div>
