		<div class="comment_text"><p>This looks cool Raymond. I read your last post just now also. I'd love to have a chat with you about a potential partnership - we're launching a Security API designed for developers who build apps with a WebView (which is most apps). We help them protect consumers from malware and phishing attacks - and if they want, block XXX content - particularly useful for educational and faith-based apps. Wonder if we could have a chat via email to start with? paul at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetacert.com%3ALGMW9DZb93nln_WaxfrtDsWIVeo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="metacert.com">metacert.com</a></p><p>BTW I appreciate your tool as I was one of the original seven founders of the W3C Mobile Web Initiative - which was pretty much out of date by the time we got it to market - thanks to the iPhone :)</p></div>
