		<div class="comment_text"><p>As far as jobs go, another data point:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indeed.com%2Fjobtrends%3Fq%3Dcoldfusion%26l%3D%3AcGdf6XqRIQgPcepuxMTxiI68tRQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=coldfusion&amp;l=">http://www.indeed.com/jobtr...</a></p><p>But as Ray mentions - relying on only one core language is career suicide as a developer.</p><p>The CF market has matured and is declining. Although there are many companies that have invested millions into their application, and it's not something they'll get rid of any time soon. But it's a self-fueling problem in that as the # of jobs goes down, the talent pool naturally shrinks as people invest their learning elsewhere, which because it's hard to find people causes companies to work on migrations to other technologies thus further shrinking the # of jobs.</p><p>Being a JavaScript master is the strategy I'd recommend to a CF'er. It's something as a ColdFusion developer you can naturally add to your CF apps, as part of your regular job. While at the same time JavaScript is the #1 most sought after skill at the moment.</p><p>Try to only use CF as a back-end REST API, while building JavaScript heavy UIs using something like Angular, Ember, Ionic, etc... and you'll be in really good business (could even then swap out the CF part later as your JS app won't care as long as the interface remains the same).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I never visit CFBloggers anymore, although I do use an aggregator to get the information. As far as CFML decline, while I don't have numbers, I don't think this is strictly limited to CFML, but it does seem like CFML is declining fast. The way I understand the situation is that CF, PHP, ASP.NET and the like are currently considered 'The old way of doing web stuff.' I am playing catch up on 'the new way,' as fast as I can in my spare time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think one other thing to consider is the state of application development, in general, and the way it has changed in the last few years. I feel like it used to be that you could just have ColdFusion and you could built a rock-solid application, even an enterprise one.</p><p>But, the expectation of applications has started to shift in huge ways. With single-page apps, mobile apps, WebSockets, image processing, telephony integration, etc., I feel like no "one" technology is sufficient any more. So, while we build stuff in ColdFusion, we also have stuff - in the same application ecosystem - written in other languages like Node.js.</p><p>For what it does well, I think ColdFusion is amazing. But, trying to get it to everything is painful, by no fault of its own. Things are just evolving. So, maybe a bit off-topic.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>At my old job, we used to print paper. The way that the paper reports were replaced was not by developing new systems, but to simply "print" the paper reports to pdf files. This was a shop that was still using COBOL in the year 2000. So languages can hang around for a while. With the Internet though, I think the speed at which a technology can be replaced is about as fast as Brian Williams being replaced on NBC Nightly News. I hope that helps your Google juice, me mentioning Brian Williams.  Anyway, for us ColdFusion/Railo/Lucee developers (I had never heard of Lucee until about a week ago), I would LOVE IT if you could put a blog post together on how to migrate from cf to Node.js.  Maybe do a standard SELECT * followed by an output loop.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If Cold Fusion does hit 13 and then dies out, It would be great if Node, Rails etc started skipping 13 due to 'Unlucky version 13'. CF would live on forever in memory :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Node.js and Angular are very different things. :) Node.js lets me write back end applications using JavaScript. It is a gross simplification, but imagine replacing ColdFusion code with JS code on the server.</p><p>AngularJS is a way to architecture a client-side application. You can think of it like Framework1/Model-Glue for CF.</p></div>
