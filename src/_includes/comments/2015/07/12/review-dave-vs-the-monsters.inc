Like you, the AoT series was my first and remains my favorite.  I am delighted that the series will continue (someday) in ebook installments.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nope, sounds interesting. I'll add book 1 to my wishlist.</p><p>Man - Tutrtledove. I read "Guns of the South" and loved it. I then read "World War", and I thought it was a fascinating concept. (I'm very interested in alien invasion stories that are NOT the ID4 variety.) But then the series just went south so bad. I had to finish it, but I dreaded every chapter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Re Destroyermen:  This series is the only thing Taylor has written.  The first three books are a bit rough reading at times, but the concept is so fascinating (like AoT) that it carries you through.  The rest of the series, for me, is always a page turner.</p><p>Re Turtledove: Also loved Guns of the South.  Binge read the Southern Victory series.  Also enjoyed the World War alien invasion alt hist books.  Not much else has interested me.</p><p>Then there is, of course Steve Stirling.  His Island in the Sea of Time  alt-hist series is breathtaking, but ended far too quickly and, despite significant encouragement, Steve hasn't chosen to revisit that world.</p><p>Which brings us back to John, who is apparently a much softer touch than Steve, allowing himself to be persuaded to continue the AoT series.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stirling: I liked ISOT too - and I kinda enjoyed The Change series, but he dragged it on way too long. I thought Conquistador (which was one book, not a long ass series) was great.</p></div>
