		<div class="comment_text"><p>I stumbled into working with ColdFusion back in version 4 (right before Allaire got purchased by Macromedia) back around 1998. At the time, I was working customer service for an ISP in New York, right upstairs from a guy that ran a CF Hosting/Dev company. My best friend/coworker was a smoker, so we would end up huddled outside in the winter, chatting and shivering while he enjoyed his nic fix. The CF guy took pity on us and started inviting us in out of the cold.</p><p>Eventually, we became decent friends and I took an interest in helping him solve some of the coding issues he was butting his head against. He had a pretty big project coming up that he was deadlocked on, so I spent a weekend reading one of those massive Ben Forta books, helped him figure out his logic snafu, and next thing you know, I was working for him. Ive been making my living solely off CF since, up until just last year when I switched to Front End Dev for my current place (Curse, Inc). I still mess with CF in my off time for personal projects, and I probably will for as long as I keep getting new versions. ^_^</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Indeed, got the job last year and moved out to Huntsville, AL. Curse's big push right now is actually its VoIP package, Curse Voice, pretty great for voice chat while gaming. I'm working more on the CurseForge sites (the sites focused on making life easier for the mod authors). Its all built on a .NET backend, but I get to stay in my SCSS/JQuery comfort zone for the most part, so I'm happy.</p></div>
