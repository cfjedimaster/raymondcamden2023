		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the link to The English Open Word List (EOWL). You may also be interested in the 12 dictionaries project, although it looks to be offline temporarily. It includes pronunciations of words found common to 12 separate dictionaries (thereby the most common words for people trying to learn English). I think I might use EOWL for a spell-check preprocessor. In other words, when my students post a comment, every word will be checked against the list and they will have the option to add any new words (submitted for my approval). I should also have a banned word list for typos like "Im" (without the apostrophe) and the personal pronoun i in lowercase. And yes, some students do post like that. So automating the calling out process would be very helpful. Last semester I played with automating the calling out process by having canned responses in their email when I graded their posts. Something along the lines of "Dear so-and-so, I'm not saying you're getting sloppy, but you have got to capitalize the personal pronoun I. Please edit your comment and _then_ I'll take a look at it." But catching it earlier would be better.</p></div>
