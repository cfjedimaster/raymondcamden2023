		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the great review, Ray!  Good also to note that the per-form field time data is great for quickly spotting pain points in your form, where revised copy/tips/etc. can make a big difference -- even before implementing event handling when people act like they need help!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond, thanks for taking the time to creating such a thorough review. I was genuinely interested in giving it a try but <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fformatic.ly%3Amc8Q6Ey8fpUff3SLbPXMXfym_-4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="formatic.ly">formatic.ly</a> uses a live demo for onboarding new or potential customers. I really wish this practice would stop. At this point, I don't know if this is an enterprise solution or 10 bucks a month.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes, they are probably (and hopefully) doing some A/B testing on their landing page. The one I viewed only had the option to contact them to schedule a demo.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Keith, thanks for the comment and my apologies for taking a couple of days to respond. These are exciting times as we launch the company. We completely agree that the right model for a SaaS offering is to have a self-service on-boarding process - and share the frustration when established SaaS players don't offer that!</p><p>At this early stage we decided we would like to speak directly with our first cohort of clients to make sure we really understand their needs before we open up everything online. This will help us in fine tuning our pricing and tiered service offerings so they make the most sense to most people.</p><p>FYI, our entry level small business pricing starts at $100 per month. We can also set you up with a free personal account once we have spoken to get you started. Please give us a shout at info@formatic.ly so we can get you started!</p></div>
