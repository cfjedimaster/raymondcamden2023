		<div class="comment_text"><p>New Relic is offering great tools, akin to what in the past has cost a lot more than they're asking.<br>One thing I haven't been able to work out is how to send New Relic extra information when ColdFusion errors. For example passing more than just the headline stack trace so that we can log pertinent session and request variables. I was wondering is you or anyone else out there has ever hooked up CF and New Relic beyond the standard JVM monitor? Thanks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You got me there - I only tried NR when I moved to Wordpress. I can say though that if i were using ColdFusion, as cool as NR is, I'd use FusionReactor instead. They really are the #1 tool for CF sites.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've done a bit of that and created a New Relic connector for Lucee, which I'm sure you could easily adjust for ACF as well. You could also easily modify it to store additional information. You can find the code here:</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmso-net%2Flucee-newrelic%3AXp-pccUQXWzfMfQr5z8tQGkoL-E&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/mso-net/lucee-newrelic">https://github.com/mso-net/...</a></p></div>
