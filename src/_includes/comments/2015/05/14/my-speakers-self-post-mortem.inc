		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me, my biggest concern is making it relevant to the group I'm presenting to. For example when presenting Ionic to business managers I need to start with how it can help reduce costs. For front end web developers, it's sinking in the idea that they can be mobile app developers too. To Angular developers it's reusing existing code in a mobile app. Native developers, "Here's a tool to use for platforms you're not familiar with, but is structured similarly to native IDEs". Every presentation needs to be tweaked and different parts stressed to give them an incentive to care about what I have to say.</p><p>Then it's making sure that each concept builds off of the other and that I never talk about something that assumes an understanding of something they don't yet understand.</p><p>Jokes and being relaxed and relatable help a lot too.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I attended your Ionic presentation yesterday. I have little Ionic background but a strong grasp on Cordova and Bootstrap. I had made the assumption that I could replace Bootstrap with Ionic to handle responsive AND mobile but now realize that Ionic replaces jQuery (to some extent w/ AngularJS) &amp; jQuery mobile.</p><p>I thought your presentation was very good. I agree with your points about ngcordova. I lost you a little bit there. However, wrapping things up with your personal Ionic project was great and you should definitely expand on that portion of your presentation. I think it connected well with the audience and provided a great demonstration of the usefulness of Ionic and the speed to which you can spin up an app. Even though the example didn't include Vader or kittens, I think most people would approve. Nicely done.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I recently gave an Intro to Ionic talk to front end web devs, and after I realized that I didn't spend time explaining some of Angular's concepts before diving into a live coding demo. What do you do in this case? Is it possible to give a 15-minute intro to Angular before diving in?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can do a lot in Ionic just by modifying the HTML. Depending on the group's technical competency, you might even stick primarily to Ionic Creator.</p><p>If time allows, yeah, an intro to Angular is preferred and I've done it for some groups ahead of workshops. One bit of caution, have a break between teaching people Angular and Ionic, at least half an hour, preferably a day. It can be easy to overwhelm people with new information.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I only discuss Angular in terms of it being a prereq. I warn people that I "suck" at Angular, but I'm able to be successful with Ionic anyway. I also point out a few places to learn Angular and strongly urge folks to go through the tutorial on their site before trying to use Ionic. I think you can *kinda* get by knowing little about Cordova, but you really need to know the basics of Angular.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is great advice, thanks. Giving a talk next week to some local college students with little web dev, so might stick to the Ionic Creator and the CLI. Thanks again.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I attended the static site presentation. When you first started talking about Dreamweaver, I started looking at the exit doors to work out how i could escape without being noticed, but when you got into the detail of generators, then that was when it became very interesting. Personally it would have grabbed me more from the outset if you had shown us one of your static sites that first looks like a dynamic site, and then thrown in the static curve ball. I hadn't contemplated building a static site since the 90's, so for me it was an eye opener. Discussing both Harp and Jekyll to the detail you did was a bit of an overload for me as a new static newbie, which i presume was the audience it was aimed at, but overall it was a great presentation and i gained a lot from it. Funnily enough in the bar later the Preside CMS guys were in the process of launching the new Lucee docs site (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.lucee.org%2F%29%3AHA_42Vp_TMG1WxYHeSZChGy6VtU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://docs.lucee.org/)">http://docs.lucee.org/)</a> which was developed using Jekyll</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad you didn't walk out when I mentioned DW. :) It really is a darn good editor. Is it good for me, and probably many of my readers? No. But for a large segment of people who work on the web it is a very good tool. I always felt like it didn't get the proper respect for what it does.</p><p>Glad to know that Harp+Jekyll *is* a bit too much and that just cements my idea of just showing Harp (and mentioned Jekyll). And I really like your idea of showing a site first as an example and then telling folks it it static.</p></div>
