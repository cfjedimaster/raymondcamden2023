		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just downloaded the final edition. Thanks Ray. You recommend Ionic and Angular as your choice of HTML app building. Do you think jQuery Mobile is dead? There's been no updates for a year. Ionic is tempting but they haven't announced development for a Windows Phone version. In the UK Microsoft sales were up to 11% of all phone sales and I expect it will increase once 10 is released. Will you be writing a book on Ionic/Angular or can you recommend one?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know about jQM. I'm actually updating my book for the most recent release (1.4.x). We (me and the publisher) we're waiting for 1.5 to be released but it hasn't happened yet. People still use jQM and obviously I thought it was worth the time to show it in the book - mainly because of how simple it is.</p><p>Check out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FManning.com%3ARSriHLnx5rsAD-hA0BXklBk7ps0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Manning.com">Manning.com</a> - they have a book on Ionic too. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I knew about the road map, but not about the recent meetings. That's good. I may push back to Packt to see if they want to wait. We've already waited multiple months though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Amazing! I thought the jQM team melted away ages ago. Those meeting notes are solid proof they're still going. Good find, David. But why aren't they updating users via their blog or Twitter? Strange. I expect they all have full time jobs elsewhere and only work on jQM as a hobby or part time.</p></div>
