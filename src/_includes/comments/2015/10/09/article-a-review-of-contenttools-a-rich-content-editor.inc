		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's interesting. I often thought it would be nice to have a browser that allowed users to edit pages. For instance, a page written years ago with outdated information could be edited to hide the old writing and show the new. Of course, there would have to be a seamless version control system allowing the user to scrollbar through a timeline of the changes. I suppose it's called Wikipedia. But you know - a browser that made every page a wikipedia style page, with a horizontal scroll bar that showed you the changes.</p><p>It has usage rights implications of course. "Wait a minute!" an author might say. "How come I said X and everybody that browses to my page using the new-fangled browser sees Y?"</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Looks nice. I've ended up integrating gridmanager.js (shameless plug, I wrote it) into all my CMSes these days. It's more of a layout manager + ckeditor though. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fneokoenig.github.io%2FjQuery-gridmanager%2Fdemo%2Fckeditor.html%3ADG03xdH85cRo03OJxP78IdkXFZU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://neokoenig.github.io/jQuery-gridmanager/demo/ckeditor.html">http://neokoenig.github.io/...</a> <br>Plus, it has kittehs.</p></div>
