		<div class="comment_text"><p>First, thank you for the creation and management of the project all these years (hard to believe it has been nine).  Second, I am glad Adobe picked up the ball.  While GitHub is where the files and projects should live, I like RIA Forge as a central library.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I occasionally search RIAForge for a solution or inspiration instead of having to re-invent the wheel. It was *and still is* a valuable resource. I hope Adobe keep it open and don't degrade it like they have with the CF docs to a point where you just don't want to use it. RIAForge is unique and thank you Ray for all the work you did building and maintaining it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>+1 - I also like RIA Forge as the central library and files/projects on GitHub. Thanks Ray! And thanks Adobe for keeping it going!<br>-Aaron</p></div>
