		<div class="comment_text"><p>SPOILERS!!!! Rey and Leia?  Is Rey the daughter of Leia and Han?  Was she fighting her own brother?  The whole hug at the end was either a huge plot hole or more to it that we'll get to next movie.  Your thoughts?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Possible - but I really don't want to see *all* the characters related. It feels like that would be too much. Could I see that happening? Absolutely. Will I get over it? Yes. I just hope it isn't the case. :) I've also heard it suggested that she is Luke's daughter. That too feels like it would make things too connected... but you could always blame the Force.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Go see it again. I found it had a level of detail that I simply missed on the first pass. A few:</p><p>Solo &amp; Kylo(Ben) - at first I thought the scene was disjointed and oddly acted. Second time it captured a level of intent and strategy within Kylo. He knew what he wanted when he walked out on the platform, he knew solo would follow, he faked(well) struggle to draw solo in. Second time the betrayal was even more powerful.</p><p>Phasma - I was initially let down by the all silver captain. She could have been the new Fett, she could have had more active fight scenes. Feels like many of her scenes got cut. On second viewing it changed, she was exact very all knowing. Her initial scene with Finn where she caught him helmet off was very powerful, how did she know he was there? When she was captured later I initially dismissed it as weak but second viewing she was tackled by Chewy. Not much you can do there. I do hope she made it out of the compactor in time. I would like to see more Phasma.</p><p>Chewy rampage - After solos key scene his rampage was amazing. In grief he became perfect and destroyed everyone in his path and then detonated the building while still inside. Second viewing this was even more powerful and thought out.</p><p>Rey discovery - I thought it initially odd that Rey discovered the force. It was very similar to Luke's path in New Hope but the arc was different. On second viewing this changed, her discovery started in the woods when she was force held attempting to shoot kylo. Her acting there was subtle, she encountered something she knew and rather than terror, I saw a touch of enightenment. The torture scene that followed was the best of the film. Initially if felt it was a touch rough but on 2nd. Viewing it was perfect. Her learning accelerates as she encounters the force and it grows steadily. Mind trick discovery, incredible.</p><p>Creatures - on first viewing I though there was decent creatures in the film. Second viewing there are 3x more. The depth of creature shop in Maz cantina was just incredible and second pass was jaw dropping great. Even the human powered ones on Jakku were better. The 8 person human powered hog was much better 2nd viewing.</p><p>I am so glad this film happened. It embodied why I am a fan and recapured the imagination. Go see it again, there is a deeper level of detail you miss on first viewing. But it is a hallmark of great Star Wars film that they can be watched over and over with ever more detail and this one indeed does that. I thought it was 30% better the second time and I think that is its secret. Abbrams/Kennedy nailed the essence of Star Wars and the depth and layers of the film got better second time around. I know there is more to discover in the film. While exiting the theater, My friend asked did you see the Fleet exploding like popcorn during the first detonation? I just smiled, I guess the 3+ viewings will only reveal more.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the comment Ted. A few responses for you:</p><p>1) Do you think Kylo faked the entire thing on the bridge? I thought he really did struggle. According to other sources (not sure what, but I've seen it a few times now), Snoke is intentionally trying to keep Kylo "in the middle", not just light or dark. So I'd imagine his struggle there would be real.</p><p>2) Phasma: Yeah, I'm pretty sure she won't be killed. I think they learned their lesson when they gave Fett a lame death. (Although in theory he is back alive now based on the events in "Aftermath".)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I liked the movie even if I feel like it didn't quite live up to the excellent reviews. It's safe to say that it far exceeded any of the prequels, but that's a fairly low bar to set. Was it better than any of the original trilogy? I'm not so sure.</p><p>I thought Kylo was a decent villain but still lacks the presence of a Darth Vader. I wasn't that impressed with Snoke - in fact, I hate to say it but I kept thinking of Kaos from Skylanders whenever I saw him <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvignette4.wikia.nocookie.net%2Fskylanders%2Fimages%2F9%2F9e%2FKaos_Promo.jpg%2Frevision%2Flatest%3Fcb%3D20140509174634%3Abzi2WNyPYtWg7WQIFjQ2V_QPh50&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/skylanders/images/9/9e/Kaos_Promo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140509174634">http://vignette4.wikia.noco...</a></p><p>I also thought the movie dragged a good bit in the middle.</p><p>My biggest complaint is that it payed way too much homage to A New Hope. (SPOILER) I mean it basically followed the plot of ANH to a t - even practically recreating the famous Mos Eisley cantina scene. This is a problem that JJ Abrams has had in the past. I will say that it didn't ruin the movie in the way that it ruined what could have been a great movie in Star Trek: Into Darkness. However, the homage was enough to be occasionally distracting - taking you out of the movie in a way.</p><p>The effects overall were fantastic. Even the use of non-digital effects worked fantastically, so much so that some of the digital effects stood out in a negative way. I felt this especially with Maz Kanata. She just didn't feel as "real" as everyone else in her hideout and her close-ups felt fake.</p><p>All complaints aside, this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. I'd also add that it was by far the best acted Star Wars movie ever. The leads were great - but even Harrison Ford had his best performance of the entire series. He managed to convey the swagger and smart ass nature of Han Solo with a tinge of sadness and loss. It was really a much more nuanced performance than I expected from him and he really deserves some recognition for it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>She's definitely the daughter of someone. It doesn't make sense that she'd be Han and Leia's daughter as they had plenty of discussions about their past during the movie and never mentioned a child other than their son. It would seem odd that they never mention a daughter if one exists.</p><p>I thought, especially the way the movie ended, that it was leading to her being Luke's daughter - Jedi rules or not. There really isn't anyone else for her to be related to that she could have inherited her force powers from - unless Yoda was getting busy at 900 years old ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but that is the first thing I said when I walked out. It felt like a good portion was a reboot, without calling it a reboot.</p><p>Kylo Ren was the only real negative I had. Once he took his mask off, Adam Driver came off as a petulant, whiny child (to me, personally). There wasn't a presence as the antagonist.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Finally saw it today.  While I enjoyed it a lot, and it definitely captured the Star Wars feel, as others have said it borrowed way too many plot elements from A New Hope.</p><p>One observation: everyone in the movie referred to it as "Luke's lighsaber."  Given it's blue blade, it looks like the saber from the first movie, which means it's technically Anakin's saber, right?  That would probably make it even more important to Kylo Ren.</p></div>
