		<div class="comment_text"><p>You can try out my nj/manual-refresh branch--it adds a function in ProjectManager you can call to refresh the file tree. <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fadobe%2Fbrackets%2Fpull%2F3370%3APTHP0n7GpgYCQhCBNuhaqYF0bs8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/3370">https://github.com/adobe/br...</a> (you could make your extension just see if that function is defined, and if so call it).</p><p>Also, writing a node extension isn't that bad :)--there's some boilerplate you have to use to set up the connection which we should really factor out, but once you understand how that works and the standard function signature for async calls, it's pretty easy.</p></div>

If people *really* dig this extension and ask for it, I would, otherwise, I'll wait for binary support to be added.</p></div>
