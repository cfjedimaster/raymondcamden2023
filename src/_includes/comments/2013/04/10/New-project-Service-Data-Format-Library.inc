		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great idea to gather some mocks for popular services.</p><p>I think it would be also be good to get some standard data formats going via HATEOAS / hypermedia API's. A few of us in the community have been working toward standardization of hypermedia types, such as Siren and Collection+JSON.</p><p>That way, you won't have to write a bunch of custom code to deal with each different service, and you can get to the business of actually writing your app.</p></div>

When you query it for an object, the response includes enough meta information and links to help you navigate around the API and find related objects, including paging, self links, links to references, possibly a root collection link, and so on.</p><p>Using a model like that, it acts a lot more like web pages, which are powerful precisely because they can link. Most current JSON API's do far too little linking, and almost none of them do it in standardized ways.</p><p>When we develop hypermedia types that allow us to build a reusable, shareable JavaScript API for interacting with our web services, we'll have made a giant leap forward in API interoperability -- the same kind of leap that was made when hypertext became HTML and made the leap into the browser over HTTP.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting. I'll be honest and say I don't think I grok this 100% yet. Would this be a practical example?</p><p>Given an API that makes use of this, if I requested a list of data, I would know where to find the request details to get the next page of data. As opposed to needing to go read a 'real' doc and code it differently for each service.</p></div>
