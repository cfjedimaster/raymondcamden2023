		<div class="comment_text"><p>Would love to go.  Know of any advanced ColdFusion conferences or training opportunities coming up in Texas?  My team would really like to dig into some of the stuff most ColdFusion trainings don't cover.  Like incorporating jqueries, using the display management tags and any other good stuff we may be missing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Specifically for training opportunities, I'd check with <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FFigLeaf.com%3AWXFAvT0_erU2O8lRTSdH2m9hF34&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="FigLeaf.com">FigLeaf.com</a>. I always recommend them for training. For CF conferences, the next one is cfObjective (Minneapolis). I don't think there is anything close to Texas unfortunately.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is Max the huge conference where Adobe has classes/sessions on all their products except Coldfusion? If it is, could you tell them to set CF free and sell it to someone who will actually promote it to the world as one of the best web application platforms still going strong after 15 years? They can actively develop it, but if new developers don't know how great it is why would they ever use it. Yes, I know Coldfusion, so I know how to go to the download page and look for it. Remember Max Boston, Orlando two years in a row? Good times when a company cared about and featured CF.</p><p>What a shame, building the web at MAX 2013</p><p>    WebKit<br>    Adobe® Edge Inspect<br>    Adobe Dreamweaver®<br>    Adobe Edge Animate<br>    Adobe Edge Reflow<br>    Adobe Illustrator®<br>    Adobe Fireworks®<br>    Adobe Typekit®<br>    Adobe Flash® Professional<br>    Adobe Business Catalyst®</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would like to see ColdFusion too at MAX, but if that is the only product you care about, then yes, MAX isn't going to interest you this year. (I'd also strongly encourage you to branch out though. It is *very* dangerous for someone to focus on just one product.)</p><p>The ColdFusion team has announced they are hosting a conference later this year. You can read a bit more about that here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.coldfusion.com%2Fpost.cfm%2Fsurvey-on-the-coldfusion-summit-a-two-day-coldfusion-conference-from-adobe%3A7wqda1eOhvdpvgGBQX2IGcA3lIc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/survey-on-the-coldfusion-summit-a-two-day-coldfusion-conference-from-adobe">http://blogs.coldfusion.com...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Appreciate the link about the conference this year. I never said anything about focusing only on Coldfusion.  I can focus on other technologies too, but I can't focus on Coldfusion at ALL because there is not even one session at Adobe Max!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>MAX has simply changed over time. I guess I don't see this as a big deal as I work with a lot of Adobe tech (and did so before joining them). If MAX isn't for you anymore, I understand.</p></div>
