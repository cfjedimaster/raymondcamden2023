		<div class="comment_text"><p>I love CodeSchool, man, and I try evangelize them to my colleagues in higher ed. My intro--following Jeffrey Way's 30 Days to Learn jQuery--was their JS/jQuery Air/jQuery Air: Captain's Log a little more than a year ago when I was really trying to polish - and by the end I was like, "shit, I've had *fun*."</p><p>My only beef is that they're really rails-centric and I just frankly don't get a lot of professional opportunities to work with rails. Big fan though.</p></div>
