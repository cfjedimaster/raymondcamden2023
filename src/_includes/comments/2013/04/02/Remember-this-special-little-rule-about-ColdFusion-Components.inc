		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, I've had varying degrees of success with the step debugger.  In the end, I've rarely had to step debug through ColdFusion code. Now JavaScript on the other hand - I've started adding "debugger;" at the top of every new function I write and I examine every assumption.  ColdFusion just works.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Step/line debugger in eclipse/builder, once setup right (that is a whole other story), really has helped us get through the huge coldbox code mess we have. Before I used the debugger, aborts and cfmail, catch/try was the only way, now with line debugger, it is much easier...but that is of course if I can get it set up...but again, everyone has a different feel for it...I still like to use the Ray approach, messages everywhere till i get what i need...LOL</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have issues with the debugger as well.  I've used it in the past, but for one thing it's painfully slow and hard to set up.  Sometimes the mappings seem to work, other times they don't.  I have not used it recently.</p><p>We use Coldfusion here since we have limited resources for web applications (i.e. me) and it's still one of the quickest ways to get things up and running but there are some things that are just a pain, the debugger is one.</p></div>
