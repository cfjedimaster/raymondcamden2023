		<div class="comment_text"><p>Quick comment on my own blog post. I've got an odd issue with shutting down the server. Right now it can take from 1 second to 2 minutes. No idea why. I got some help from Ted Patrick and others on Twitter, but I've yet to really _look_ into why it is happening. So um... don't shut it down. ;)</p></div>
