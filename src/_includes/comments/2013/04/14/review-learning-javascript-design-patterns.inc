		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just curious if you've also read, "JavaScript Patterns" by Stoyan Stefanov?  If so, I would be very interested in how they compare, considering they are both from O'Reilly and published within a couple years of each other.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Opinions on any given JavaScript book seem to vary considerably, so while I've only read one book whole (Crockford's Javascript: The Good Parts), most would seem to have a lot to criticize.  Crockford's has plenty to criticize too but its compactness made it an interesting and  first book to completely read. I suppose I wasn't ready for it but it was a good choice, a good foundation, and sure made me think. I believe Crockford calls it a beginner book which is kind of funny to me.</p><p>On the topic of design patterns, I read the heralded "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" shortly after it came out (many years ago now).  It is definitely a book for comp-sci types (as you would say) and while that's my degree, I thought it was overrated with many tedious patterns in tough psuedocode; and not abundantly pratical.  At least that's how I remember it now.  However, now, the simpler patterns, at least, from the book, are well-known and muh used and it only increased in popularity. Maybe I should admit that I was wrong but I continue to think that a lot of people must have purchased it (based on glowing recommendations) that didn't get as much out it as they thought they would.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know this post is old, but hopefully this will help someone: I <br>borrowed and read Stoyan Stefanov's book two years ago (2014) and found <br>it to be excellent. I now need to read such a book again, but saw that <br>there was this newer one by Addy Osmani, so even though I questioned why<br> another book so similar would exist, I bought it, thinking it would be <br>better being newer. I am a very experienced JavaScript developer, but on<br> reading this book to refresh my knowledge of patterns, I have found it <br>to be terribly written. Very confusing. Many of its examples leave a lot<br> for the reader to work out for himself, whereas a couple of comments or<br> a short paragraph about the example would have made things much easier.<br> Not helping at all with all this is that many of the variable names and<br> function names in the examples are very confusing indeed. I read and <br>understood Stefanov's book in a very short time, because it is well <br>written and organised, but with Osmani's book, I've had to keep <br>re-reading examples and paragraphs, and even then, I've given up on <br>trying to understand some parts altogether. I now have to buy Stefanov's<br> book (which is cheaper, by the way) and I just wish I could return this<br> book as 'faulty' and get my money back - but how is that possible with a<br> book?</p></div>
