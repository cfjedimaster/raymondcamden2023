		<div class="comment_text"><p>Michael - please take this with a LARGE grain of salt:<br>My understanding is that if plugins follow a particular API and have a proper XML file, they can be installed via plugman. So basically, it is more than just making a PG plugin, it's creating a way so that it can be installed via the CLI.</p><p>I *believe* the phonegap CLI is using plugman under the hood. Frankly it doesn't matter to me as it just plain works, but I'll try to get a real answer for you.</p></div>

But this is not going to happen. To your second sentence - where npm installs phonegap shouldn't typically be a concern. npm handles making it available as a command line program. You should be able to run "phonegap" in CMD or Terminal and not be concerned where it explicitly installed the bits. If you are, npm is fairly standard about where it installs stuff.</p><p>"The Phonegap build folder for cloud should come as a seperate installation "</p><p>I thin that would be a huge mistake. With one command you can build locally or via the cloud. I think that's awesome.</p><p>"I had phonegap build phonegap this and that in the npm folder and in the npm cache folder.

So if phonegap the tool needs Foo the tool, it will fetch it as well. Who cares? Let npm worry about downloading the bits and dependancies and just *use* the tool.</p><p>The rest of your comment is concerned about so I'll just repeat myself: Why do you care about the bits *behind* phonegap the CLI? You don't need to be to use it.</p></div>

Later when I wanted to go find out where one of the mysql config files went so I could cross reference it with with a percona server file lo and behold I could not find it until doing some extensive cd'ing,  find /tmp /var/tmp . $HOME -name fooing , grepping and switching back and forward to in the cpanel file directory.  Thank god for Cpanel, I would have spent way to much time typing in the CL instead of just clicking in the cpanel file directory.</p><p>  The "Coolness" is not so cool to me when I would like to inspect the "bits"(files) and<br>possibly modify or extend them, but then get sick of traversing through bunches of 20 level<br>deep folders.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Zoran, in the plugin, there is a file called plugin.xml that has instructions for how the phonegap cli is supposed to install it, and it specifies what platforms it supports and where to put the platform specific files. For example, in the Speech Synthesis plugin it has a platform tag with the attribute name="android" and inside that tag it specifies where to put the java files and how to alter the res/xml/config.xml file. It can also specify how to alter the AndroidManifest file. The javascript files should be the same for all platforms so they're specified outside of the platforms tag in plugin.xml.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi raymond, I'm also migrating a project to cordova 3 which used the TTS plugin and I'm having more than an issue making it work again, the lack of documentation is not helping,<br>do you have a working sample, even an HelloWorld project, of the plugin running?</p><p>I placed the snippet you stated in a *ttsTest* function called by *receivedEvent* after the *onDeviceReady* has been fired, my whole index.js is as follow :<br>_________________________<br>var app = {<br>    // Application Constructor<br>    initialize: function() {<br>        this.bindEvents();<br>    },<br>    // Bind Event Listeners<br>    //<br>    // Bind any events that are required on startup. Common events are:<br>    // 'load', 'deviceready', 'offline', and 'online'.<br>    bindEvents: function() {<br>        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);<br>    },<br>    // deviceready Event Handler<br>    //<br>    // The scope of 'this' is the event.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ok figured out the problem, not the locale but the timing of initialization for the TTS engine,<br>in the previous plugin there is the *startup* function wich inits the TTS engine and with its succes callback ensures that any *speak* action is correctly executed :<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmacdonst%2FTTS%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F2.2.0%2Fwww%2Ftts.js%23L101%3AEB15eTuj3NrJBM-U9ILKa5lwGXo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/macdonst/TTS/blob/master/2.2.0/www/tts.js#L101">https://github.com/macdonst...</a></p><p>in SpeechSynthesis instead the start action is delegated to the speak action instead, meaning that with the first utterance you also start the engine,<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmacdonst%2FSpeechSynthesisPlugin%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fwww%2FSpeechSynthesis.js%23L19%3AEprVsAWSlq5k3KFb9W4amc-Ez6U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/macdonst/SpeechSynthesisPlugin/blob/master/www/SpeechSynthesis.js#L19">https://github.com/macdonst...</a></p><p>but this means that you don't know exactly how much it will take for the action to take place, in my case it seems that the utterance is not executed even after the TTS has been activated, just tryed to exit and re-enter fast the app and it would speak only after a couple of tentatives,</p><p>I guess I'll push this issue to Simon (maybe he knows already)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Anyone know if Cordova CLI pushes down latest plugin files on each "cordova build" call by default? If not is there a param to force that? The plugin rm/plugin add is super tedious and prevents makes it really hard to test out local plugin changes.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure I get you. If you do plugin add, it fetches it remotely, so it is always latest. The build operation is just copying stuff over so it will NOT get the latest bits. But honestly - how often do you think the plugins are being updated? Looking at the Dialogs plugin, it was last updated 14 days ago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Raymond. I was updating a plugin locally to use a background thread for IOS but kept wondering why my Plugin.m file wasn't being pushed down to /platforms/ios each build. I guess you answered that - plugins don't get pushed down each build.</p><p>Just for sake of pointing it out - if I had a custom plugin and wanted to test some plugin changes I would - based on how Cordova CLI is setup -  have to:<br>- Commit my local plugin changes to GitHub (or wherever) <br>- Then do a cordova plugin rm, <br>- Then do a cordova plugin add <br>- Then run my app in device/simulator.</p><p>Unless I'm missing something - based on the above it sure would be nice if a simple 'cordova build ios' simply pushed plugin changes from /plugins/PLUGIN to /platforms/[platform]/plugins for me.</p><p>Maybe I'm doing it wrong?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh, so you were actually modifying the source code of the plugin locally. That's not something I've done when using the CLI. I'm not sure I'd use the CLI. I mean I'd use it to start the project, but then I'd switch to the editor for the platform my plugin is working with (well the platform I'm working on). I'd use XCode for an iOS plugin for example.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This questions seems kind of simple to me and I've wondered it myself. I have a project that uses several plugins. I usually try to update the Cordova core when a new version comes out. I run the CLI command to do that. How do we do the same thing with plugins? How do we update our plugins to use the latest version?</p></div>
