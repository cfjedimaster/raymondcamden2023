		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is going to be a great event. I'm biased as a TACFUG volunteer, but I hear people at other tech meetups talking about it and they are stoked at the great sessions. There aren't that many web development conferences with the coverage that NCDevCon has.</p><p>We also have a good time and the RTP area is a boom town with lots of craft breweries and great restaurants. Don't miss out!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Argh!  I just talked with my manager and the organizations policy is no funding for conferences, and it's just down the street from me.  Maybe I can convince the wife we can spring the $200?  Probably not as we have some other expenses that take priority coming up.  sigh.</p></div>
