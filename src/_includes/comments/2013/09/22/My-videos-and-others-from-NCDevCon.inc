		<div class="comment_text"><p>Doug is sort of a hermit. He really is an interesting guy doing some great work for W3C. Sometimes he will come out to JS meetups in the RTP area. I talked with him some at the end of NCDevCon and encouraged him to propose sessions for NCDevCon 2014. He seemed like he was interested in doing so. Thanks for being so gracious about substituting in the PhoneGap training session at the last minute.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great presentations.  Hate that i missed making it this year.  I liked your points about HTML 5 and it'll be nice to stop pulling down JQuery UI and Validation for every app as you suggested.</p><p>I did have a question, at the end of the Brackets presentation a guy walks up and starts talking about CF and running through the index page, module development, etc.  He brings up people switching from CF and is he a dinosaur for using/sticking with CF.</p><p>I'd be curious to know what the rest of that conversation was regarding CF.  I face uphill battles defending CF and am wondering the same thing lately.  I'm trying to expand my skill sets out, adopting and learning a lot of your suggestions on the blog, but still come back to CF as a core of what i like and want to keep using.</p><p>Thanks</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The conversation started in the recording but then it cut off pretty early in.  I was curious where you saw CF fitting in and where it was going for CF developers which i believe is what he was asking.</p><p>It seems there are fewer and fewer people out there pushing CF, using it, or defending it.  I recently read that the Mach-II team has ended development, <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.maestropublishing.com%2F2013%2F09%2F03%2Fsunsetting-mach-ii%2F%3AQntZF96TiEcpODZLFQceFTXHpmI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.maestropublishing.com/2013/09/03/sunsetting-mach-ii/">http://blog.maestropublishi...</a>, and moved on from CF.  It got me thinking that if even the "die hard" CF developers are not staying what does that mean.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I pretty much said - whether CF has a future or not - is that you should be updating your skills by adding new back end technologies and front end skills as well. Do not rely on just CF.</p></div>
