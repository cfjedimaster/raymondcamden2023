		<div class="comment_text"><p>In my Phonegap 3.0 revamp I am trying these out. They are pretty cool. Seems very simple and eliminates having to design two different menu UI for Android and iOS.</p><p>In your book will you be discussing icons? One thing that is a drag with JQM is not being able to easily place your own icons. You have to deal with the background circle and shadow. I have been able to use my own but geez it is like a css nightmare to get it set up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes custom icons in general. I chatted with Andy briefly on GitHub. In JQM you should be able to swap out all their icons and those stupid circles behind them very easily. I had to hack the JQM CSS and can't even remember what I did, which presents problems when I update. It ends up looking pretty cool but is a challenge to replicate. I can't post a screenshot or I would show you guys.</p><p>Just a thought.</p></div>
