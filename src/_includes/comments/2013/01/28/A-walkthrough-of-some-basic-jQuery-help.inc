		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray, thanks for another relevant post - just out of curiosity how would you structure the user code in a cleaner code.  This may sound trivial to an experienced jquery coder but newbies like me struggle with the code let alone the structure...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Considering just the top version:</p><p>1) Obviously there is some indenting issues, but that is mainly from emails we sent back and forth. I shoulda cleaned it up a bit in the Gist. ;)</p><p>2) To be honest, I'd mainly just reorder things a bit. I'd have my 2 var statements on top. Make that 3, sumDisplay should have one. That's about it really. Purely aesthetic.</p></div>
