		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ah, I need one of these.<br>The most interesting chapter, by far, is all of them! Now, on to the reasons you should give me one of the free ones:</p><p>1) I love reading books, and read several big fat tech books every year. This would not sit on a shelf, but would be consumed and absorbed in short order.<br>2) WE WANTS IT<br>3) At the bottom of the page, there was a section named "Who this is for". When I looked at it, my name was there. Honest injun!<br>4) Starting a new gig Monday, and the big cheese was asking about mobile. I told him Phone Gap is popular with CF folks. He stopped just short of saying "Make it so", but I think he will say that soon. (Note that this reason, like number 1 is actually true. The others may or may not be fuzzy with the factual)<br>5) WE WANTS IT<br>6) My ADD has improved greatly in the last, ooh it has a butterfly on the cover.<br>7) I have a mobile phone! A book about mobile development, and I have a mobile phone! This is clearly fate, destiny, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Clearly the answer is Chapter 7: User Interface Development with jQuery Mobile. This is a skillset that will not just transcend phonegap development, but will allow me to more quickly prototype ideas in general! jQuery mobile is an awesome toolset and anything I can do to get better at it will make me a happy camper!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi,<br>Thanks for this noble offer. Seems like very good read and I hope I would be able to win free copy :-). In chapters list, I like chapter 7. Since being web developer, we are supposed to think in futuristic terms. HTML-5 and CSS3 syntax is quiet intuitive which leaves developers curious about adding life to their mobile app using libraries like jQuery Mobile. I think if developers get more detailed knowledge about jQuery Mobile , they should be able to nail down cool apps quickly (as I am assuming they already have good grasp of basic HTML or HTML5 and CSS or CSS3). At my first glance chapter-7 seems most interesting to me but I have to read the whole book to make my final concrete decision :-). Rest all chapters seem quiet basic for mobile developers but Chapter-7 connects all dots of complete mobile application Thanks again</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's gotta be Chapter 7.  The coolest mobile app is useless without an effective and engaging UI.  I'm trying to get my feet wet with Mobile App development with jQuery Mobile and this book would give a reat jumpstart to that.  And well, if that's not good enough, I'm cute :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I would enjoy the chapter "User Interface Development with jQuery Mobile".  Learning to harness the power and scalability of jQuery in a mobile format would be invaluable to my work place dev environment.  Having worked in both Eclipse and Apple Dev I really welcome the ease and adaptability that I know jQuery will bring.  Thank you for considering my submission.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chapter 1 would be the most interesting. To me an interesting app would be one that can make good use of a mobile devise's movement and location features. There are to many apps that make good use of the mobile UI real estate, but an app that uses movement instead of normal touch would be interesting. Overall looking at the contents the book does seem useful for mobile development altogether.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The most interesting sounding chapter is Chapter 5: Hook into Native Events. Why? Because PhoneGap is about the ability for the programmer to reach into the native controls and elements of the various hardware platforms. And what is more about that than interfacing with native events. Chapter 5 is going to bridge that objective between my javascript code and the essential native events I want to interface with and manage for the outcome of my application.</p><p>I would truly appreciate the hard copy version of your esteemed book! Many thanks.</p><p>-Ric</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am most interested to read Chapter 2 on storage options. I've been working a lot with the new IndexedDB API and I've been really curious how possible it is to use this in PhoneGap, as I've been building an abstraction and synchronization service on top of IndexedDB and I want to make this available for PhoneGap applications. Your talk at NC Dev Con on HTML5 storage choices was really good, so I can only expect this chapter (and the rest of the book) will be a great resource.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chapter 2 intrigues me because of a stats-heavy application I want to augment with mobile functionality; for fun, I have developed a softball league management app and would like to provide the functionality for team managers to update game stats via mobile devices while at the field. So the idea of somehow managing local data storage seems a good fit to work into a mobile solution.</p><p>That said, I wear black socks with sandals - and think it's OK, which means visual design is not my thing. If jQuery Mobile could make whatever interface I develop look even kind of decent, then I should spend some quality time with that chapter.</p><p>p.s. Props to Matt Gifford; I wore out the binder on my OOP and CF book, real helpful stuff!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me, they're all good but if I look at what is most interesting to me right now, it's Chapter 5, and by extension Chapter 8. I think that is one thing that if one can master the hooks into the native already present as well as developing plug-ins for more of those hooks or features, PhoneGap and my use of it will continue to improve dramatically.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>All of the book sounds interesting and useful, but Chapter 5, specifically pausing and resuming applications sound incredibly interesting, as it's something I'm going to be working on shortly. I have a JQM project I'm running through PhoneGap Build to put on devices, and making sure the app properly handles the user making and taking calls, using maps, etc is the next big to-do on my project list.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think that all of the chapters sound very interesting.  However the chapter I am most interested in would be Chapter 6.  This is primarily for the section "Working with remote data and AJAX requests".  This has been something I have been struggling with using Phonegap.  Not because of the white listing but just working with external APIs.  It would be nice to really figure out how to work with many of the great APIs out there to build some awesome mobile mashups.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi:</p><p>I´ve just took a look into the chapters and I think that chapters 6,7 and 8 may be really the most interesting chapters all over the books. I´ve been developing phonegap applications for a few months now and I´ve been having troubles when I try to dinamically create and update dom elements.</p><p>Chapter 8 seem also very interesting because sometimes phonegap lacks a bit when you try to access some native functions. I´ve had to go native and develop a pair of plugins when I´ve tried (for example) to make the telephone start a phone call and this chapter should have helped me a lot for sure.</p><p>Thanks for this book, I´m pretty sure that a lot of people would like it and find it helpful. I hope I can win a free copy too :)))</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have to agree that it all looks interesting and would be a great book to reference.  I keenly find Chapter 2 most interesting.  If we think what mobile apps mean for businesses, it's all about having content readily available.  The "I want it and I want it now" mentality.  But think of application teams that support the rapid development of these business apps, likely targeting not 1 device OS but many that make up the company's footprint, I see usage of PG a must to keep up with our user demand.  Why go native anymore and have several versions of the same app.  PG to the rescue.  Looking forward to working with PG more &lt;the book will help&gt;.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me, Chapter 2: File System, Storage, and Local Databases is the most important chapter followed by Chapter 1: Movement and Location: Using the Accelerometer and Geolocation Sensors.  I am a graduate student working on a project to create a mobile app for sea turtle conservation volunteers to use during the upcoming sea turtle nesting season to collect both location and scientific sea turtle data to be submitted it to a remote database.  The goal of the second version of the app is to include the ability to capture photos and video, so Chapter 3 would be useful at that point.  As other's have mentioned having good UI design is very important, so I'd expect Chapter 7 to be a key chapter as well.  The reason I am excited about this book is that I did a bit of web development a while back, but I've been out of the loop lately and since the sea turtles will nest whether the app is done on time or not, I need to get back up to speed very quickly and efficiently, especially since this will be my first app (ever).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Most interesting to me are chapters 1 and 2. My aspiration is to make a droid out of my droid by creating a mobile application of my own design. I haven’t yet decided on creating a thermocapsulary dehousing assister or a protocol droid but these chapters will be helpful either way. They will need to access accelerometer and geolocation information to be helpful to their master (me). I’ll need information about our position and movement. Chapter 1 will provide the information I need to code that portion of the functionality. The information in chapter 2 will be useful because they will need to be able to store information about our adventures and retrieve it when necessary. Uploading information to a remote server will be required for backup and possible synchronization with the base and possibly other droids. I have design for other mobile apps but this idea is, of course, my highest priority. :)</p></div>
