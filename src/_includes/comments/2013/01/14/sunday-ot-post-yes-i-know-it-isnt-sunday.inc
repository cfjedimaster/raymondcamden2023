		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Tim! I'll report back on the game. Believe it or not, I never played D&amp;D. I've owned many copies of the rule books, played D&amp;D games like Neverwinter, but never played a 'real' D&amp;D game. I know this is just related to it, but it will be as close as I get probably. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As a collector, I will suggest that you tread on careful ground before you end up with 500 board games like the rest of us. Soon your collection is worth more than your car!</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboardgamegeek.com%3AFbn9r6bQXrgkZNZlQRh59K3Q5Ik&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="boardgamegeek.com">boardgamegeek.com</a> is the meta site for boardgaming, but a UI nightmare</p><p>I presenting a bunch below in three categories. All are either for or great with 2 players. Basically, look at the picture of the box to see if you would like the theme. There is sci-fi, dark fantasy, realism, "old world" abstract, high fantasy, etc.</p><p>Catan is not good for 2p. Munchkin is ok for about 10-15 minutes, it's like a 2 on your scale above.</p><p>One thing to note is that a lot of games are either "living" in that they have regular expansion installments or they have one or two expansions to add more to the game, such as Mage Knight's new expansion. X-wing is the only one that needs an expansions that I've listed below.</p><p>Player vs. player (eliminating each other) - <br>Android Netrunner (love, love, love this game), <br>Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game (get the starter and one of each expansion) (love, love, love this game), <br>Claustrophobia (if you are ok with demon theme),<br>Blood Bowl team manager,<br>Memoir '44.</p><p>Co-op - (the first three are very similar)<br>Pandemic <br>,Flashpoint fire rescue <br>,Defenders of the Realm. <br>Lord of the Rings, the card game, like Android Netrunner encourage you to buy expansions. <br>Dungeons and Dragons Legends of Drizzt board game.</p><p>Player vs. player, but not really direct conflict:<br>San Juan, <br>Thebes, <br>Galaxy Trucker,  <br>Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries, <br>Tikal, <br>Tobago, <br>Alhambra</p></div>
