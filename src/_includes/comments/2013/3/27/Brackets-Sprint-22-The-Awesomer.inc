		<div class="comment_text"><p>Since you turned me on to Sublime Text 2 last Fall, I've been using it exclusively and completely gave up on ColdFusion Builder, which I think is the worst editor I've ever used, except for vi back in the early 90s. (OK, I realize I'm being dramatic!) It's not that Eclipse is bad, because I like Eclipse. But Adobe definitely blew it with CF Builder, IMHO. There have been far too many bugs, and a few that have significantly got in the way of how I work (CF Search Dialog!!!) Without trying Sprint 22, all I can say is that I hope Adobe learns from that effort as to how a modern editor should work, and they can somehow bridge the gap between CF Builder and their new editor.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think CFB is a fine product, but it just isn't one I *need* right now.</p><p>Also keep in mind Brackets is *not* an Adobe-only project. It is open source and has contributions from many people outside of Adobe. It's a group project.</p><p>You can help right now. :)</p></div>
