		<div class="comment_text"><p>Cool Ray, thanks. Would be nice to get a advanced look at this new CF. Hopefully some new cool tags to work with on the new version. Do not use the Builder though. Write code from scratch everyday.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Had not clue of that, as oddly as that may seem considering how long I have been programming with CF - not once have I bothered nor had the time to research the CF Builder. I use good old DW for it all... Got a fee copy of it you can send me? :)</p><p>Side note: It would be great to be where you are located since my daughter lives down there, well down there from up here. I could attend the seminars in person as well. But hey there is always the Internet.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Can not say she is into tech to much. I know you did not know her age. She is a turn of the century girl. She just turned 13 on the 16th. of this month. I know she likes the computer and has her own mobile right now, but it is monitored very closely. Not to sure how far away from you she is located. Somewhere named Pineville.</p><p>Will check out the CF Builder if you think it is worthwhile, just DW lets me create my templates and code all in one, plus the easy FTP'ing. If I can not do all of that with it, not much use for it.</p></div>
