		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've heard so many good things about that game!  I love the TR series and have played through all of them except the embarrassingly buggy Angel of Darkness (I tried, but the bugs were so bad that at one point you just couldn't finish it ever).   The new TR is on my list of first games to buy when I get my PS3 in a few months :-D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I usually only play sports games (and worms 2) and I actually decided to give this game a try myself and I found that I loved it.  Don't think I ever played a tomb raider game before but I enjoyed this immensely.  Can't recommend it enough.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad you ended up enjoying it so much! Honestly, it is probably one of my favorite games of this console generation (the others being Skyrim and Bioshock). The action sequences are a totally new thing to TR - older games did not do this well. I found a few of the tomb puzzles a little complicated but there weren't any frustrating moments as in TR games past. I've also been trying the multiplayer. It's not the highlight of the game for sure but its not bad either.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is good. Enough for more than 3.4M in sales in 4 weeks. Sadly not up to Squeenix's expectations.</p><p>Best part of completing it is to go collection for the 100%. ANd you tend to find bad things you missed on the first play-through. And yes I also did a tomb - after you said they were not that hard I gave on on the Coastal Forest a go again. Eureka!</p><p>Definately recommended (played on AMD PC with proper hair TESSFX)!</p><p>8/10 and yet to try multiplayer.</p></div>
