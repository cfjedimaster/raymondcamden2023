		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good idea! This has also been done for Javascript PureMVC frameworks:   <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Faddyosmani.github.com%2Ftodomvc%2F%3ALHh-x7nIid7OvwYA-e3uA-nrtcQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">http://addyosmani.github.co...</a>. I am curious what you come up with.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Just bought the book so I might follow along... I write a lot of Javascript - but it's definitely the slowest development work I do, anything I might learn to write it faster/better &amp; get it into production would improve my bottom line - so thank for picking up this albatross.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good thinking. You already started doing? I'm interested in helping out... maybe we could create a github together for this? Only read some parts of the book online. But would like to delve deeper too.<br>Already read 2 java minded pattern book though.</p><p>Greets</p><p>ps: I hope you can see my email... otherwise just google jochen szostek or so... :) grts</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To be clear, this is something I want to do myself. Not that I don't want to share - and I definitely want people to comment/criticize/etc, but this exercise is my way of figuring stuff out. Know what I mean? I look at GitHub as a place to share projects, things that will be ongoing. This is simply an education process for me.</p><p>Does that make sense?</p></div>
