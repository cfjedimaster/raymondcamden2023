		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for sharing this. You are the first person I found sharing samples outside of the released samples from Adobe. Perhaps you can answer a question: Your sample, as well as those from Adobe, work when I open them directly with my browser. That is, I open the html file from the harddrive. However, when I try to access the same file via my local webserver, the load svg command does not work. All the other snap.svg library features appear to work (those provided in the Adobe demos) but svgs do not load or are not displayed through my web server. Do you have any advice? <br>thanks,<br>John</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm. That seems odd. So are you loading the SVG via a relative url? Can you show me the code (or a portion of it anyway).</p><p>As an FYI, you are welcome. I'm glad someone liked the post. :) I'm working on a slightly more advanced demo now.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you for answering. I copied your html and svg files exactly. I put the html, svg, and snap.svg javascript in the same directory in my webserver's subdirectory. My PC is running Windows Vista and I view the web pages in FireFox.  Normally, when I hit my webserver via my PC name or via localhost, I get a normal web client to web server interaction. But with this project, and all the samples from Adobe, the load svg just doesn't work. However, if I open the HTML directly in FireFox, the loading of SVGs works perfectly, for your sample as well as Adobe's.</p><p>Since posting my first comment, I've tried this in IE and Chrome and found that neither of these appear to be able to load an SVG regardless of how I open the html. However, my main goal is to get the web server interaction to work in FireFox, since FF can display the SVGs.</p><p>I should also add that I'm a flash developer and have never had to understand the web site development side of things. It's not your job to bring up to speed if the problem is ignorance on my part. So, I don't want to burn much of your time on this.</p><p>thanks,<br>jg</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm. So I guess what I'd recommend is to open the Dev Tools on your browser. This can give you a clue as to what is wrong. It is probably something simple as my demo is rather simple. If you've never encountered your browser dev tools before, there is a wealth of examples out there. Here is a recording of a presentation I did on the topic:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raymondcamden.com%2Findex.cfm%2F2013%2F2%2F22%2FPresentation-Browser-Tools-for-Debugging%3AVxLWFtgLEubPbtD-PbJUaki_i0U&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/2/22/Presentation-Browser-Tools-for-Debugging">http://www.raymondcamden.co...</a></p><p>Also - there is now a Google Group for Snap help. (I'm not saying to stop asking for help, just pointing it out. :)</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F%23%21forum%2Fsnapsvg%3AjXTMwF5ZTic9kvuDh_CYlXo5K_Y&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/snapsvg">https://groups.google.com/f...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>John,</p><p>I was loading the local copy of my test file in Chrome on Mac, and I could not get the Load to work either. Opening it in Firefox worked, so I fired up MAMP and accessed the file via localhost, and it worked in Chrome.</p><p>Hopefully it will help. Finding your post helped me get to this point. I was ready to throw my MacBook against the wall.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for this great tuto!. But I have one question. For the SVG files, you call on the script the svg file, then you add &lt;div id="graphic"&gt;... I dont really figured out how the script find by DOM or whatever the place or tag where SVG file goes! (sorry about my english)<br>Thanks a lot again!</p></div>
