		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm confused. According to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fharpjs.com%2Fdocs%2Fenvironment%2Finstall%3A0Ef8jK5-G2rajbqEmfnBLMVj0EE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://harpjs.com/docs/environment/install">http://harpjs.com/docs/envi...</a>  you do need node.js</p><p>So what did you actually do with this example? Install harp locally which needs you to install node, then compile the source to static pages, then upload to s3?</p><p>I don't get any advantage over plain HTML files. If I create a 5 page static site I will start with my template (page 1), copy it 4 times and paste in my content. You would have to go in each file anyways to make changes anyways as the header and content info are different. So what's the purpose? Just to have a dynamic layout? On a small site it will hardly ever change. If anything regular HTML files would be better as I could have a twitter feed box on the right side of one page and a left column box on another page. Using harp I assume that I would need different layouts or some programmatic way to say "On this page, include this). Certainly doesn't sound any quicker as I can make text changes in two HTML files in about 15 seconds</p><p>I hope I'm just clueless and you can explain to me the benefit that I didn't understand from your post.</p></div>

Please see their Getting Started guide and you will see.</p><p>"So what did you actually do with this example?

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Btw - someone remind me to post my cost on Dec 1. :) So far I have 5 cents. Last month it was 8 cents. So in one day I'm almost half there.... but I found I had some demo assets for ColdFusion stuff that apparently I had forgotten about and they were still getting traffic. So I killed them all. 5 cents a day is still less than 2 bucks a month so I'm fine with it.</p></div>
