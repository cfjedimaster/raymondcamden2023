		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was hoping much more on the summit rather than how about you did not liked too much about the environment. If I am not wrong, this was your first post in quite sometime about CF and many like me (who were not fortunate enough to travel to US from India and other countries to attend this summit) were expecting much more details. I am sure its not wrong if your 'virtual students' expect that much from you. Ah, enough of rambling, can we expect some url's of all recorded speeches/presentations if there are any, any positive/negative vibe this summit brought about the product, business ramifications about where we do stand today, especially this was Adobe doing, figures will help.</p></div>

If so, either I failed pretty badly or you read pretty quickly.</p><p>Recorded URLs: The presentations were not recorded. I *believe* the keynotes were and when I see the URLs, I'll add them to the main entry.</p><p>Slide decks: They were gathered - but I don't know if we are sharing that URL just yet. Again, when I get it, I'll post it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good review. Sounds like being there would have more impact. I think Ben is onto something but see another answer. Rather than just being developers we need to make sure our work is getting business accomplished. When our work is getting business done we are valuable developers. Sadly, myself included here historically... we were as a community too much about tech and not enough about business. This is IMO the largest cause of our contracted numbers. It is also IMO the game changer for the future that will determine if we grow or contracting more. This principle plays different in the enterprise than non-enterprise but it is the key factor in both cases.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My company remains on ColdFusion 8. Hopefully, we will be on 10 early next year and ColdFusion remains in our data center. Very little new code is being written in CF as management is moving most of it to .NET code.</p><p>I didn't go to the summit and probably won't in the future. I'm glad they have it and wish them well, but it way more money than I want to spend on learning things that I won't get to use for years if ever. I would love to hang out and see all the folks, but there are other ways to spend my budget that make more sense.</p><p>Ray, didn't they have colored tape on the floor? :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well said, I think you summed it up pretty well for a lot of us. Here's my take: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.miuaiga.com%2Findex.cfm%2F2013%2F10%2F26%2FAdobe-ColdFusion-Summit-2013-CFsummit2013%3A5jp4qIuns1oeUKyco1hWu7VQoBg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.miuaiga.com/index.cfm/2013/10/26/Adobe-ColdFusion-Summit-2013-CFsummit2013">http://www.miuaiga.com/inde...</a></p><p>That's not the best picture, the rooms were pretty dark as far as a camera is concerned (I'd love some tips on taking good freehand conference session photos without washing out the screen and blinding the presenters with a flash), so in case you can't see it, the blinky arrow was pointing to "October 2014 Las Vegas, Nevada". As I understand it, location is still up for grabs, somebody just got clever at the last minute and changed the 3 to a 4 on the intro slide. But I don't think there's any doubt we'll see another summit a year from now. Whatever you're betting on, that's a win for all of us. Great job, all.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I enjoyed the conference!  It exceeded my low expectations for a conference that was new and only two days long.  I left having a good idea where CF was headed with a list of new and updated features.  As a federal contractor, it's VERY difficult to get a trip to Vegas approved.  CF is still fairly prevalent in the federal environment, I urge Adobe to please consider a different location.  Having said that, it was AWESOME!  Hope to you next year!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ferrell Ferguson,</p><p>As one of the aforementioned Content Advisory Board members, I am interested in what makes a conference in Vegas difficult from a Federal contractors perspective and how you managed to get it approved.</p><p> I want to do what ever we can next year to allow the most number of people to attend. We want to get the official dates out there ASAP so people can get permission and budget approval soon.  We also want to have the content up earlier so bosses can see that this is not a boondoggle.  Any other suggestions that make it easier for the government sector pleas let me know!</p><p>One priority with this conference was that there would be a low financial barrier to entry.  Every conference is going to require 3 main costs, Ticket, Hotel &amp; Flight.</p><p>Flights: Two of the consistently least expensive places to fly into are Orlando and Las Vegas (for obvious reasons)  Naturally you can get lower prices to other cities at certain times.. but flights to Orlando and Vegas stay rather stable.</p><p>Hotel:  Finding a Hotel that has (or is near) a conference center is hard.  These hotels tend to be big and expensive. Also once you get over 500 people you start narrowing down the available choices.  $100 a night is a deal!  If we were to hold a conference in, say Orlando, hotel costs would more than double.</p><p>Ticket: This is the number Adobe has the most control over, they kept it low so people could afford to attend. They by no means made a profit on this conference. Curious fact: each soda that an attendee drinks cost the conference 4 dollars.</p><p>Vegas was able to keep hotel and flight costs low for one reason: They plan to make their money back from gambling.</p><p>I look forward to hearing any suggestions on how to make things easier for the public sector folks.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Tim,</p><p>Great response.  I believe the two biggest issues in the Federal sector are the stigma of "Vegas" being nothing more than a boondoggle, and having the conference so near the beginning of the fiscal year.  With the new fiscal year starting October 1, money cannot be legally appropriated for a conference and travel within the new fiscal year until after it has started. Some of us have been fortunate in the past to have supervisors agree to pay for it ahead of time, but only if we pay all the costs up front (with the hope of getting reimbursed).</p></div>
