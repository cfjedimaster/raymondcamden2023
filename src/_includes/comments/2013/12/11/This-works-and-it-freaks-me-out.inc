You can use namespacing like you would in javascript as well.  <br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fdfgrumpy%2F7923587%3AmYcFHC9kEPUrTB2zkAg-3UN_T0g&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://gist.github.com/dfgrumpy/7923587">https://gist.github.com/dfg...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure I agree with you. By itself the extra {} aren't making a closure - not in the example above. In yours you are when you *specifically* return the function, but by *itself*, as in the code above caused by a mistake on the dev's part, it isn't a closure.</p><p>Right?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's just extra parentheses, it does not cause the function to use closure.
