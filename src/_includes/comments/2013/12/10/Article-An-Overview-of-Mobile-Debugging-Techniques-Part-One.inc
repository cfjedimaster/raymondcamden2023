		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>i just read your post, very interesting imho.<br>recently, looking for good tools for mobile, i discovered tho:<br>1) mosync and its companion mosync reload<br>2) corona<br>the latter is based on LUA language, the former, based on eclipse technology, is ideal for html5/css or hibrid apps, and its js library, almost compatible with cordova, permits to send sms too; also it can be of bridge with c++/c # modules invoked from js.<br>last but not least, it can assemble apps and transfer the packege to device via bluetooth.<br>if you can/want, take a look and tell what do you think about.<br>regards</p></div>
