		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm okay with Goodreads and I hope it doesn't implode since I have so much information on there. I don't use the social media aspect too much.</p><p>I have several of the books in my stack "to read". I look forward to the Gaiman book. I joined a couple book clubs so some of my reading has been books I wouldn't have considered. This was the point of joining since most of my reading had started to be non fiction scientific books, many on infectious diseases. I started reading more classics for one of the clubs which has been good for me.</p><p>I don't read enough now since I've joined a lot of meetups, but I'm getting back to it over time. Thanks for the list. I'm going to explore some of them.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, for 2014 you should read Kingmaker, by Christian Cantrell. It is an incredible novel, and it's being optioned to be made into a film (by the producer of 300 no less) is well deserved.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Containment is awesome as well. IMHO every bit as good as Clarke, Heinlein, or Asimov. My only complaint is that his Adobe job gets in the way of him writing more! :-)</p></div>
