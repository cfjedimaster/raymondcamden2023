		<div class="comment_text"><p>These websites are interesting.<br>What I would like is the ability to interrogate them with a student's credentials and receive back a percent complete. I'm not sure if that would mean a REST call or what.</p><p>That way I could hand it out as an assignment and have the assignment graded.<br>One thing that students are having to deal with these days is that there's so much good stuff out there.  A teacher might tell them of a great website to go and explore, but the students are trying to navigate which assignments are graded and which ones are simply because the teacher is excited about their profession.</p><p>My students for instance, are not computer science students, but the university wants them to be exposed to just a little bit of programming.</p><p>So everything's got to be graded, even if it's a scratch pad that allows the student to type anything in.  At least I would know that the student actually went to the website.</p><p>Maybe the website could generate a GUID, the student copies and pastes the GUID into my assignment, and then the grading program could ask <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrycf.com%3Az8mPO_sHqyyXNarf8aB4Xj8BXpM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="trycf.com">trycf.com</a> what the percent complete is for this particular GUID.</p></div>
