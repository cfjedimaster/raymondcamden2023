		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, you are correct and that is kind of a major bummer. As a blogger, it bugs me when sites don't provide a way to contact them back. Maybe we just aren't seeing it (still digging).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sean and Raymond,</p><p>Thanks a ton for pointing this out.  It was certainly a silly oversite.  We've created a google group for anyone who would like to discuss CYOApp further:</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F%23%21forum%2Fcyoapp%3AL0l1Ff5N3DR82gLntIFhi5nl-tg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cyoapp">https://groups.google.com/f...</a></p><p>We also maintain a Twitter account if you'd prefer that route:</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fcyoapp%3AtGAgV-p83cGa01-CRfCxjhslWCg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://twitter.com/cyoapp">https://twitter.com/cyoapp</a></p><p>These links (and more) have been added to our "Credits" page as well as our landing page.</p><p>The person responsible for the SRT contact form is looking at that as well.  It was completely unrelated, but made for a hilarious comedy of errors.  See, I'm laughing with you!  That's how it works :)</p><p>Anyways, thanks for the heads up.  I also fixed the code typo while I was at it.</p></div>

Ie, maybe I want to switch from Node.js to ASP.Net w/o starting a new adventure.</p><p>Possible?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond,</p><p>That is actually on our short list of new features.  We wanted to get it out before we released at CodeMash last month, but it simply din't make the cut.  We are hoping to get that feature in before our next conference in April, but with all the billable work we are currently looking at, I'm not sure it will happen immediately.</p><p>The best we have for the time being is to create a new adventure, and just fly through the chapters you've already done.  At the bottom of every page, there is a "Download Source" and "See This Changeset" link.  You can use those to pick up at any point and continue on.</p><p>Thanks for the compliments and the impressions!  We saw about a 10% increase in our user base today alone!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Allow me to take the opportunity to point out that *this* is the type of responsive development (as opposed to responsive design, of course) that the rapid, non-enterprise web needs, particularly with this type of site.  Problem submitted, fix assigned, and reply/fix initiated.  Even if it were to take a while to code/test/implement, the direct and non-glazed response to your user base is itself worth its weight in gold, IMO.  Thank you for providing a great example of that.  If we can minify code, we can certainly simplify the response mechanism for valid user concerns.  Great job, guys/gals!</p><p>-S</p></div>
