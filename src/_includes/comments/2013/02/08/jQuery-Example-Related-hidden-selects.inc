		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice. The advanced application development book for CF has something like this but much more complex. Have made it work on a few areas. Although what you have here is much more simplified and probably much easier for someone to understand ; as it makes for a much easier solution. Agree simplified is better for most.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Interesting, it would seem you sent him to the correct place then. Hey, is it possible to speak to you about the hosting your banner shows on here. Have been looking for a possible VPS plan or a better option of hosting for me and my clients. Have been with <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhostmysite.com%3AztrKeOUKmog7P-dSXj3cUUhcUfs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hostmysite.com">hostmysite.com</a> for about 8 years and wanted to get some input on the services Hostek is offering other than what I found on the site. Can we speak by Skype? (317)614-7383</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually I did speak with them just now. The main reason to speak to you was about the service and how there servers are when it comes to lag time, up time and customer service more less. Have you ever heard anything bad about their services is really what I was needing to get the scoop on. Otherwise, appreciate it. Not sure if you will get any kind of profit off of this since I signed up from your banner. THX Ray, keep the news coming.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>ray, very good example, but i've an idea: you use dor select's an indipendent div, but i think that if you nest divs you can dinamically calculate if a select has a child and populate it; this way your code will be more abstract, imho.<br>regards</p></div>
