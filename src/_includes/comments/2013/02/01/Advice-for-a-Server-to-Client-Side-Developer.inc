		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>I switched to CF a month back from Java. Since then i am regular reader of your blog. It is full of information. This article is also very resourceful. I have learned about few other resources. Although i have one question, "Does W2schools  website contains wrong information?". I am new to programming world. I have referred it quite few times. I also would like to know what are the good practices for newbies?<br>Thanks<br>Tushar</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I definitely agree with "If you don't have a problem, you don't need 'em." Don't worry about all the other stuff at first: if you try to check out even a fraction of the libraries available before you've got some experience with JavaScript, you're likely to end up with conflicts that you won't know how to resolve because you haven't had enough experience with "basic" JS.</p><p>JS and jQuery are pretty much like any other languages and tools in that there will always be too much for you to master, no matter how much time you put in. All you need for strong command is working knowledge of the basics plus Google-fu to find libraries when you need them (or sites/blogs that can recommend them). Start with the basics and add in what you need as you go along.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Thanks for Reply. I checked out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fw3fools.com%3ATgKBD2Qm-0BupvmWuNGAgbNiC70&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="w3fools.com">w3fools.com</a> and really surprised to know that W3schools have so many inaccurate information. So sad, I thought it is one of the best resources available online. Anyway Thanks for all the help.<br>Tushar</p></div>
