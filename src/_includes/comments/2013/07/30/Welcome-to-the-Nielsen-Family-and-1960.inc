		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been a Nielsen house about 4 times now.  I see it as "voting" for my favorite shows, because that is how shows actually earn money (Advertisers pay for spots on TV shows based on the Nielsen rating of the previous days/weeks).  There are three types of surveys they do :<br>- Real Time (based on a smart appliance you opt into.  Think a Tivo or an STB that they give you).  These are permanent installs and account for something like 5% of their ratings.<br>- Dailies / Overnights.  They call a random sampling of people.  These are given to the broadcasters very quickly to find how how their shows did.  It accounts for something like 15 - 20% of the ratings.<br>- Weekly Diaries.  This is what you got.  They pay people some money (it ranges for $2 to $25, depending on how much they need your demographic and if you've done it before).  They send out TONS of these and expect to get back a small portion.  It's pretty labor intensive for you and them.  Because they do account for DVRs (and starting soon, services like Netflix, Hulu and other streaming), this is the number advertisers really like to see.  The more people watched the show, the higher the shows can demand for the ad spots, the more the show gets paid by advertisers.  This number is also used during the "keep it on" or "cancel it" decision.  They say that it is one of the more accurate surveys of what people are watching, and is supposed to be statistically sound (it's not for regional and local programming).</p><p>The reason why they don't do it online is because they are afraid that a majority of America can't get online (or won't).  They know everybody can fill out the booklet and mail it back for free.  They also don't want you to do it online AND fill out the book, as they will throw out the stats.  It's screwy, but they want to make sure Grandma and the person on disability who only gets OTA channels are just as represented as you are.  In reality, they are more represented since you didn't fill out the book :P</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Rick, how long ago was that?  I thought they stopped using those a while ago because they stopped working with the newer digital cable systems.</p><p>They worked by listening for a 2.2k and 6k (?) tone at the beginning of each program (usually during the TV rating logo) to identify what you were watching.  Unfortunately, most cable systems have since switched to digital and compress the signal so much that those signals get thrown out.  They are supposed simply record what you watch and then you send it back.  They pull the info off the device, reset it and send it back out.  Most people got those for a week or two at most.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I get them every few years and I usually do them.  I've gotten $5-30 for them, paid in advance. I figure they are nice enough to pay up front, I can at least do the survey - doesn't take me much time since I'm at work all day anyway so nothing to record LOL</p><p>@Nick great explanation for how it all works :-)  Many many many many many years ago, I was one of those folks who called for the phone surveys (don't hate me!).</p><p>I wonder if another reason they don't want to have folks to do it online is they want people to fill out as they are watching, not at the end of the week where people might be more inclined to go "from memory" versus logging in for each and every show to record as it happens.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used to work for a company that compiled statistics for visits to web pages.  We partnered with the ISP's to put a box on their network that anonymized and captured the traffic.  Then we would sell reports to companies as to what kind of people were visiting what web sites.  No need for surveys or otherwise.</p><p>Nielsen Net Ratings does something similar as well as others.  Eventually it will all be like this, but there are still too many people that watch OTA.  Maybe in about another generation or so.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>When AC Nielsen died a couple of years ago, I wrote this blog piece (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftomkelleher.wordpress.com%2F%29%3A3aOWz91ZUecz031tngPWtERDkW8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tomkelleher.wordpress.com/)">http://tomkelleher.wordpres...</a>. Describes some of their technology and theory behind the scenes.</p><p>To answer Chad’s question about data entry, Nielsen continues to be cutting edge in regards to OCR (optical character recognition) technology. The 22,000 weekly paper diaries would be scanned, parsed and loaded in 5-6 minutes and that was 30 years ago. I should know, as one of my jobs there was “OCR Manager”.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It was very accurate (999 of every 1000 characters), but took a huge investment. Think of the cheap OCR functionality in every modern $100 home printer/scanner, but translated into a $100,000 device, the dedicated DEC PDP-11 mini, the OCR manager, 2 data correction clerks and 2 assembly language programmers. All running 3 shifts a day. The only significant difference between then and now, is that we only had to scan predefined checkboxes and the OCR font. Today, they are probably using the kind of technology that’s  in modern ATMs, that can scan and translate a hand written deposited check in about one second.</p><p>There was a decimal error in my math. It probably takes them 6 hours, not 6 minutes, to scan the paper diaries, assuming they use only one scanner. But still impressive.</p></div>
