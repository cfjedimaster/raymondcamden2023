		<div class="comment_text"><p>I submitted it to iTunes just the other day but, as is typical, they have a review process. It should be listed there at some point in the next few days whenever the review is complete. I am also looking into other ways to promote the podcast so that it is more easily found, but, having never promoted a podcast, it is a learning experience :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This might be the right blog entry to talk about methods of podcast assimilation.  Just last night I bought an FM transmitter for my car stereo because that was cheaper than buying a new system.</p><p>Previously I've burned CDs to listen to while driving.  That's ok but is kind of so last century.</p><p>The next step up would be to get a new radio with a flash drive where I could burn my podcasts onto a keychain.  Just one step up from burning CDs.</p><p>I've tried the cassette adapter technique, but it's just too clumsy plugging in this and plugging in that.  Sitting in a hot car makes every muscle movement a study in UI and you don't want to be fiddling with plugging things in after you've started driving away.<br>Plus the cassette started 'skipping'.  Yeah, I've still got a cassette player in my car.</p><p>The next step up would be bluetooth, but that's not as optimal as the radio is - with the radio, when you turn on the ignition, the radio is on.  With bluetooth, I'd have to start the car and then fiddle with the smart phone to navigate to the podcast that you were last listening to.  Sometimes that's as easy as double tapping on the button and then pressing play.</p><p>So I'm pondering getting a new radio with bluetooth, plus maybe a flash drive to spare, and going ahead and replacing the speakers while I'm at it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I listened to the first one. I liked it. I'm a little behind on podcasts this week (vacation recovery), but I think you guys are doing great, you're interesting and the content is relevant to the stuff I do, so keep it up. I'm looking forward to listing to #2 as well. Also, I reserve the right to criticize later on, you know, because i'm such a hater. Anyway, I appreciate what you guys do, thanks and keep it up.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So Ray, your car has a CompactFlash card reader and you've never used it.</p><p>But do you listen to podcasts in the car?<br>If so, what type of setup do you have and how easy is it to pick up where you last left off?  <br>Podcasts are a little bit harder to digest than audio books because audio books are generally on CD.  When you start the car they automatically start playing again. With podcasts, there's all kinds of fiddling you have to do to get it started after the cars been started.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Micah.  I hadn't thought of that.<br>Yeah, playing CDs is so much more fluid.  To turn them off, you just hit the car's radio button.  To turn off a podcast on my phone, I sometimes have to navigate.  I'll buy a stack of re-writeable CDs and see if they work.</p></div>
