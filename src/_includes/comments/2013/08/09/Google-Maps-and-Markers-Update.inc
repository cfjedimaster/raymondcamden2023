		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yes your are right, it looks like i made a mistake when i tried to edit the codes. I am trying to make it work by getting the addresses from database but some how i am not able to get all the latitude and longitude on the fly. I haven't saved any lat or long in database but i am trying to produce them on the fly but its totally not working. Any script to produce multiple lat and long on the fly?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Jesse: Well, I'm not sure if I mentioned it on this post, but I have on others that Google puts limits on how many geocoding requests you can do at once. Therefore I now recommend folks geocode (ie translate an address to long/lat) in a difference process that you do *one time* only. Then it isn't a matter anymore.</p><p>Ok - so I read your first sentence and replied. I can see by your second sentence that you know this. You said you wrote a script for it but it isn't working, but you didn't say *why* it isn't working. What errors are you getting?</p></div>

I am also using IE10. It works just fine in almost all other browsers but some how still not sorting out by the categories in IE10. But its not a big deal because i will be using this script for myself only.</p><p>By the way can this be achieved by eliminating the Lat and Long?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Um - ok - so I checked, and String.indexOf is supported in IE10:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fie%2F53xtt423%28v%3Dvs.94%29.aspx%3AWmndoLt4xO4-A_NxHKNlnDW81sY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/53xtt423(v=vs.94).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/e...</a></p><p>Could you maybe try a quick test of that in your IE10? I.e. literally a page with JS that just tests that. Or shoot, just use the IE10 console.</p><p>"By the way can this be achieved by eliminating the Lat and Long?" Sorry, can _what_ be achieved? Plotting records? If so, yeah, Google has a Geocode API but it has limits on how often you can call it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray thanks a lot for your help! ....... yeah i made it work. I guess '/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js' file was the issue. Now i just changed it to '/jquery/1/jquery.min.js' and this made it work.</p><p>"By the way can this be achieved by eliminating the Lat and Long?". Yeah, i was asking if there is any script which can show the multiple markers using the addresses only not the Lat / Long. But i was able to find a very short and easy PHP script to create Lat and Long on the fly. So, all this works fine now.</p><p>Once again thank you so much for all of your help!</p></div>
