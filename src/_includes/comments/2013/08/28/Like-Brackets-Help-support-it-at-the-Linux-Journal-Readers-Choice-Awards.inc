		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, I hope being open source that it will become a good Linux editor.</p><p>So I downloaded it for Debian and installed it. Nothing would launch. After digging under the hood I found out it needed the newest version of a library. I then had to go to a development repo for Debian and get the library. I had to replace the stable version that was default. Then it worked.</p><p>Obviously, if someone has few Linux skills they couldn't get it to work period. It also currently doesn't have some features that Windows/Mac have. It doesn't work on non-deb versions currently, so for that reason I don't see how it could ever be a Linux Choice Award this year. It is a nice editor and I hope it continues to make great strides in the next year so I can vote for it next time around.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>am speechless. It is a unbelievable weblog and very partaking too. Great work! That's probably not a lot coming from an beginner blogger like me, but it's all I may assume after having fun with your posts. Nice grammar and vocabulary. Not like different blogs. You actually know what you are speaking about too. So much that you made me want to learn more. Your blog has turn into a stepping stone for me, my fellow blogger. Thank you for the detailed journey. I actually enjoyed the 6 posts that I have learned so</p></div>
