Hopefully, he'll be able to return some of the qualities the older Doctors had.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I got into DW somewhere around 1981, with Tom Baker also being my first and favorite Doctor.  Same as you, I caught the old PBS reruns late at night on the weekends, but soon discovered they would also air an episode each day around the time I got home from school.  So in a short amount of time I was able to watch every episode from the beginning of John Pertwee through the end of Peter Davidson.</p><p>I've only gotten back into DW in the last couple of years or so, but I'm really looking forward to what Peter Capaldi will bring, I'm ready for an older Doctor again.  David Tennant was great, but Matt Smith has been just a little to goofy for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My first Doctor was Tom Baker as well. I usually only got to see Doctor Who about once a year when we'd take a trip to the states. We always seemed to catch the Doctor Who marathon during the PBS pledge drive. I'd stay up all night watching episodes and sleep in the car the next day. I'll never forget the nights I spent with the volume turned down so low so I wouldn't wake my parents enjoying the adventures of the Doctor, K-9 and Romana.</p></div>
