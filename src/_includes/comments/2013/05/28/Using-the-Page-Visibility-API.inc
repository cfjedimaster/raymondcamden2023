		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think I might be able to use this to determine if a student has ready down past a certain part of the page. I shy away from adding code to my system that doesn't include a grade though, and I don't think I want to make it a graded criteria that the page visibility event was fired.  Still though, it's intriguing.<br>Maybe I could make the 2nd part of an assignment locked until they've made the first part visible.</p></div>
