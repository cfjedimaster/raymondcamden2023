		<div class="comment_text"><p>Im curious as to why the audio and video are separate? I logged in and started listening to this and thought the right window (Slide Area) woudl start soon.  Then I realized that the link for "Click to Join Now" which opened the video.  Then the audio and video were a few minutes out of sync.<br>Thanks for doing this Ray.  Im looking forward to watching (and listening in sync) this now since I've restarted it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only issue I had with the presentation is that if you pause the audio, the visual continues to play so you can't pause the audio too long or else the two parts won't stay synched.  During the Phonegap build section of the presentation you mentioned config.xml.  Is this file something Phonegap includes when one builds or is it something that needs to be included in our app(s) before we zip them up and build?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You would need to include it. PGB doesn't require it, and you can set some settings via the settings in your app screen on PGB. But for access to _all_ the settings, you need to use a config.xml file.</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuild.phonegap.com%2Fdocs%2Fconfig-xml%3AioH1Z2Oano8QmQt8pyP0xa54uxs&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://build.phonegap.com/docs/config-xml">https://build.phonegap.com/...</a></p></div>
