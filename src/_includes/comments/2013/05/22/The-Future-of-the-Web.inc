		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Tink I think it often has a lot to do with who your clients happen to be. For the past 10+ years all but one of my clients was using a JEE backend, and the other was using .Net with MVC4. I have yet to have a client that was using solely serverside javascript with Node.js or whatever, but I know in some circles it is extremely popular.</p></div>

Funny the marketing thing, how Sencha had a big "HTML5 is ready" campaign and yet I don't think they used anything that people bundle under HTML5 banner due to backwards compatability in Ext JS.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Tink I took a look at Sencha when they were doing their whole "Come to us all ye who use Flex" campaign, and dismissed it pretty quickly. I have recently started doing more JavaScript, and I have come to settling on an "architecture" of sorts using a combination of jQuery, AngularJS, Mustache.js, and GSAP.js (aka TweenLite/TweenMax). I essentially use Mustache's templating to create ItemRenderers, GSAP to do any animation, Angular for dependency injection, MVC and such, and jQuery because there are some things like modal dialogs that are just easier with jQuery/jQueryUI.</p><p>It's not Flex, but it's doing alright. Now when I have time I am really interested in Dart with WebUI (similar to Angular).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We should probably refrain from saying something cannot be done unless we are certain. I've met a lot of developers at a lot of large companies that are already doing large scale apps in JavaScript. Some companies are even using a Node backend meaning they are end to end JavaScript. Is it easy? Probably not. Maybe even not as easy as it used to be with other technologies. However, it is possible.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian I agree, we should refrain from stating an absolute like it cannot be done. Almost anything can be accomplished given sufficient time spent engineering. That being said, just because something "can" be done, does not mean it is particularly well suited for that task and "should" be done. If JavaScript was truly up to the task and well suited to it, then we would not have Dart, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, etc. Developing with JavaScript frameworks and libraries makes me feel like I'm coding with duct tape. :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>"Developing with JavaScript frameworks and libraries makes me feel like I'm coding with duct tape."</p><p>Why? I mean, I like the fact that Backbone gives me a framework to help organize my code. It isn't duct tape. It's more of... a plan I guess. It lets me focus on the biz rules and less the 'where do i put this damn code' part. To me, I don't see it as I "have" to use a framework on larger apps, but that I "want" to use a framework.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, this is just my personal opinion, but to me developing with JavaScript, as it is now, is kind of like assembling Frankenstein's monster. Take this piece from here, and this piece from there, throw in a few extra parts in case someone is using IE, and add some duct tape to hold it all together, then pray that you didn't accidentally give it an arm where it should have had a leg somewhere ( lack of strong typing and true interfaces ). I realize some people love this dynamic, loose nature of the language. I myself use an Android phone instead of an iPhone because it allows me to play fast and loose with the UI and UX on my device. I don't personally care for that same ideology when I'm programming though. Just my 2p.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Keep calm, learn to ignore your brain and your own thoughts. Just trust Google, JavaScript and the global movement to braindeath. JS is just PITA because JS is not a PROGRESS (think HLL paradigm!) in software architecture but a giant step back, the exact opposite of an advancement in technology. The lame and very small common denominator of supported features as the expected (!) result of companies that would have to build standards, but are, of course, aiming at private profits and giving a shit about users, giving a shit about devs when it really comes to business.</p><p>It's crazy how people around the world think, companies that work against society and moral, because they're often forced to by market requirements (!), could come up with something social that could serve the community.</p><p>I hope more people will realize that freedom of information can never be achieved by market competitors, never be gained by the love of money. The economic system is based on competition, there is basically no interest in free and common standards, no interest in free communication.</p><p>And regarding the funny arrogant statement about web-development:<br>People who suffer from weak self perception often cannot see their own traits. Then, they tend to tell other people what they should to do ('if YOU don't ...'). So if any hipster person has not read enough about the authoritarian personality (not seldom these little dictators of IT) or narcissism he should ask himself what are underlying personal motivations to tell people to do bullshit and stop thinking for themselves. JS is like jumping out of the window - everybody does it now, you should do it, too!</p><p>So is it an awful global brainwash astroturf campaign that makes people believe, it would be a technical solution. But it's only an economic solution, to keep people working and to find as much bloatware as possible in order to be able to sell the always accelerating computing power of CPUs in the future.</p><p>So narcissistic child's play with computers, McLuhan already knew it. It wastes nerves, times and energy and is the futile attempt, to find a common language, reliable standards among hard fighting competitors. Have fun by leaving all the thinking up to big corporations, they know that it's best for us to. Use a crippled scripting language for serious development? The holy browser wars start over and over again - thanks for producing more work, red</p><p>believe Google and throw your brain away. There have never been high-level languages for serious application development, developers and engineers do not have the skills to tell the management what</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Michael: Your comment was to Nick, but I wanted to ring in about Sencha as well. This is based *entirely* on my impressions and with NO real use. To me, Sencha looks incredibly powerful for "apps", not so much for more content drive sites. If I were building a mobile version of my blog, Sencha would seem like overkill. If I were building a mobile version of my bug tracker, it would seem better suited.</p><p>Also, Sencha is *very* code oriented. So like, to build a panel, you do stuff like (and again, let me stress I'm making this shit up):</p><p>var p = new Panel();<br>p.setWidth(100);<br>p.setHeight(100);<br>somedom.append(p);</p><p>That approach works, but feels a bit awkward to me for designing a web page.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My impression was pretty much like Ray's. Most of the "applications" I have been doing lately are more cinematic in presentation, as opposed to form-based applications (although there are usually some forms).</p><p>The franken-framework that I have kind of settled on is to use Angular.js for the dependency injection and application structure logic. for my applications. For more content driven dynamic sites, I use jQuery which ties in very nicely with the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP), particularly since GSAP.js comes with a jQuery plugin to have it hijack any jQuery UI animations and provide some substantial performance gains. I will use Angular's data-bound templating in my Angular apps, but also have Mustache.js in my bag for the jQuery sites.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I put off diving into JavaScript as long as I could. But then a colleague showed me AngularJS and now I'm a believer! :)  Most of my CF is now limited to providing services (not pages), and the pages are .html files.  (AngularJS has a significant learning curve, but Flex devs have a head start.  That being said, if you can't find the headspace to relax and let your framework do the work for you, Angular might not be for you.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You could view JSON markup being akin to MXML, JSON being an alternative for XML, both of which are data-interchange formats, that can describe objects, unlike AS/JS which are programming languages.</p><p>As mentioned though you can use JS in Sencha, which is how their components are written, as in Flex where components are written in AS.</p></div>
