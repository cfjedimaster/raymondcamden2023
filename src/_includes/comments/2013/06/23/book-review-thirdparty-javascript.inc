		<div class="comment_text"><p>Awesome, glad you mentioned this book.</p><p>I actually built a premium web app that allows users to embed a widget on their website. At the time I was researching ways to do this I ran across this book which was yet to be released.</p><p>I ended up going the iframe route because it looked insane to try to detect jquery on the page then load it and deal with various quirks.</p><p>I will definitely be looking in to checking out this book.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Raymond - thanks for writing this. I've been searching high and low for some objective feedback since the book was published. It pleases me to know that you found it a good read, and that you found value outside of the book's focus on third-party stuff. Thanks again!</p></div>
