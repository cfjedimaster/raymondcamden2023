		<div class="comment_text"><p>Fantastic! As more than a beginner but not quite an expert in Javascript, I could really find the in-between stuff helpful in developing a solid understanding of best-practices and improving my basic skills.</p><p>One suggestion: Some way to mark a post/technique/etc when it becomes outdated or no longer valid/supported. At some point certain methods or property names will change, or be replaced by another technique to achieve the same thing. I think it would be helpful to link the "old way" with the "new way" somehow, or just to plainly show that Technique A worked back in 2008, but its not really used anymore because Technique B is much better/faster/simpler/etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice work Ray! I can see how this could turn into a really useful site. I wonder how you can make it more than just a searchable collection of articles. Seems like being able to browse a TOC might be helpful, or even adding some chat rooms so that people can get instant help from the community. You may be thinking pure JS right now, which is definitely useful, but not many people code strictly in pure JS. Might as well create space for all the popular frameworks and libraries.</p></div>
