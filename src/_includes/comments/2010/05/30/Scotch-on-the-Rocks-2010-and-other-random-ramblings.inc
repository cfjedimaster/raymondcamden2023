		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond, such a great write-up! I wish I could write like that...<br>Nice to see you've enjoyed your stay, and I will never forget when you and Ben saw my old CTO for the first time at the CFUGNL meeting. He was about 2.10 meters, and you guys were so amazed. That was hilarious!</p><p>Cheers, hope to see you next year! Paul</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>On the flip side of you getting to meet people other than the usual conference crowd, it was great to meet some of the US guys (you &amp; Ben Nadel) I wouldn't normally get to see.</p><p>On the basis of your talk, I'm going to start digging I to the potential of CFBuilder; and Ben's made me want to build an app with an API!</p><p>Hope to see you both (and maybe more US CFers) at SOTR 2011...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray,<br>Good to hear your travels around Europe went well, and you encountered the same issues as us natives! (Rubbish coffee, and internationally blocked content).</p><p>I have to say it added a different flavour to the mix having some more 'international' speakers such as yourself and Ben at SOTR, and I know I definately took something away from your presentations, so thanks!</p></div>
