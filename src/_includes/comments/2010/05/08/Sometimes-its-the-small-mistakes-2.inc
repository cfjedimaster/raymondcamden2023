		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice catch.  So often it's those little things, like this one, that are so tough to catch in development. It's easy enough to create large datasets to test long pages and complex data requests and many users and so forth, but it doesn't necessarily occur to someone to pick one small *piece* of an event and bang on it 40 times in quick succession.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray mentioned that with Model Glue all the URLs showed up as "index.cfm" in the server monitor. For folks who might not know about server monitor "aliases",  Aliases solve that problem. Basically, it's an easy way for front controller frameworks to have URLs that appear distinctly in the server monitor rather than all as simply index.cfm. Charlie wrote about it here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fdevnet%2Fcoldfusion%2Farticles%2Fmonitoring_pt4_05.html%3A_zf6pBqFiILlOkR_hC251MyBKe0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/monitoring_pt4_05.html">http://www.adobe.com/devnet...</a></p><p>Thanks for the great post, Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>No problem Marc and thanks for reminding us about that feature. With more and more people using frameworks, it's a pretty important tip.</p></div>
