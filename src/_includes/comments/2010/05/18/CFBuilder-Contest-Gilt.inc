		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is freakin' cool! :)  I've used Balsamiq mockups before for my Flex apps and have thought about creating something like this Flex Builder but never followed through.  Brilliant idea for CFBuilder.  Great work!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmm, ever heard of Napkee? (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.napkee.com%2F%29%3AM9xf8KZa3ybCTx2FnNJowMxCe1k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.napkee.com/)">http://www.napkee.com/)</a> -- they really have already figured this all out very well and although it's not a free solution it's really the best implementation of the BMML -&gt; HTML/CSS/JS workflow.  Plus, you can also export a BMML to FLEX!  I've been a big fan of Balsamiq and Napkee (especially using both, in tandem) as a rapid mockup/wireframe tool for a while, this has saved me quite a bit of time in my design workflow process for both websites and iPhone apps.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am a huge fan of Balsamiq.  I first heard about it a couple weeks ago at the MarkLogic Users Conference and it's totally changed the way I plan pages/sites/apps.  I can't say enough positive about it and it's built on AIR.  The ability to use Gilt with CF Builder is awesome.  Balsamiq also supports building Flex Apps from the tool using WebOrb.  Great stuff all the way around.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the review Ray. I knew straight away I had committed (lack of) error handling sin when I saw the other reviews roll in :)<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjustincarter%2Fstatus%2F13507298179%3AWLjNXP5gSFfFNDRVp64894_FcX0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://twitter.com/justincarter/status/13507298179">http://twitter.com/justinca...</a></p><p>There is heaps of scope to improve the capabilities of this extension, my problem was trying to keep the features manageable in the time I had to work on it (while finishing my job *and* packing to leave the UK!).</p><p>You can already edit the XML file to change the scaffolding markup if you wanted to, but I've started down the path of allowing custom XML files as well - you could have a renderer for cfUniForm, or ColdExt, or whatever custom style of markup you like. I just need to build a few more smarts into the parsing first - some z-index, grouping (to allow for fieldsets), and row logic - and then add a dialog to choose the rendering template. (Maybe I could even allow programmatic extension of the rendering functions - upload a CFC into the extension?) On top of that, you could have options to scaffold direct from a BBML file to a new CFM file rather than working with text selections. CSS and JS output could follow, ala Napkee. I think it would actually be possible to change the XML template right now to do (inline) positional CSS rendering though ;) (I'm not a huge fan of positional CSS, I prefer good structure + floats most of the time).</p><p>It was fun to build too so thanks for running the competition Ray. Without it I probably *still* wouldn't have played around with extensions, but now I'm hooked and even have a couple more ideas for extensions brewing!</p></div>
