		<div class="comment_text"><p>If you saw Jobs' presentation on iPhone OS4, did you notice how they built an ad for Nike in HTML5 and he purposely pointed that out?  Nike's site is almost entirely Flash.  And I can't believe they want 40% of the ad revenue for their iAds.  Sorry..i need to go barf.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well said, Ray. All of it.</p><p>You know of at least 2 people whose Apple purchases were influenced by you... and I can say for sure that it was other "Adobe-centric" developers using MBPs who finally made me take a good look at them when I had been categorically against "drinking the juice" for years.  (I was an MCSE for a bit... I had a valid excuse to be stubborn.  Or so I tell myself  :)</p><p>I saw an overwhelming number of MBPs at CFUnited 2008 and owned one by CFUnited 2009.  I did buy an iPhone a month prior to my MBP which helped me make the final decision, but there is no doubt that my Adobe comrades were my greatest influence.</p><p>I am curious as to whether there have ever been numbers published that estimate what portion of the MBP user population is made up specifically of developers using Adobe technology?  I happen to think it would be substantial enough to make a difference, assuming we all decided to move away from Apple when it comes time to upgrade our equipment.  Is my frame of reference skewed?</p><p>I made a group on Facebook back in late January, in an effort to get some idea.  I think I poorly named it, as only 6 people joined.  The title probably doesn't sound mad enough.  :)</p><p>Knowest thou of an estimate?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Despite of friendly look Apple is keeping (Mac vs PC ads, Steve Jobs wearing jeans all the time, etc etc), Apple is a large corporation like others of same weight. It needs money, loyal customers and dead competitor. That pisses off most - their relaxed image covering their carnivore instincts.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>To quote from another site, "The primary reason for the change, say sources familiar with Apple’s plans, is to support sophisticated new multitasking APIs in iPhone 4.0. The system will now be evaluating apps as they run in order to implement smart multitasking. &lt;b&gt;It can’t do this if apps are running within a runtime or are cross compiled with a foreign structure that doesn’t behave identically to a native C/C++/Obj-C app.&lt;/b&gt;"</p><p>“[The operating system] can’t swap out resources, it can’t pause some threads while allowing others to run, it can’t selectively notify, etc. Apple needs full access to a properly-compiled app to do the pull off the tricks they are with this new OS..."</p><p>All well and good. May be true, maybe not.</p><p>That said, I don't see Apple's position as being all that different from Adobe's, who in turn is trying to lock everyone into using their own proprietary plugins and expensive tools for providing "rich" web content.</p><p>For YEARS Flash under OS X was a joke. It was (and is) buggy and error prone and a resource hog and a security risk and a MAJOR cause of browser lockups and crashes. Apple, it's users, (and I) finally got tired of it. I use ClickToFlash to block it, and Apple is recommending that web developers use open standards.</p><p>Now one of Adobe's cash cows is being threatened, and suddenly Adobe and its legions of Flash developers are acting conciliatory and hurt and telling anyone and everyone, "If only Apple would work with us."</p><p>Sorry, but I'm not buying it. Adobe had a chance, and blew it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I applaud you for, even when getting emotional about the matter, staying respectful about it. That's better than some people in the community with their own blogs. :-(</p><p>I've been a huge Apple fan my whole life. Since the early 80's as a kid. And I've been a huge Adobe fan my professional career, the last 10-ish years. Seeing this go down as it has so far is extremely frustrating for me too.</p><p>I also can't find any other emotion to describe my feelings than "mad" at Apple. I'm still going to buy an iPad, and I'll love it. But I'll be extremely angry every time I now think twice about using Flash/Flex for that awesome widget I was going to develop, for fear of the higher-ups, or clients, at my organization complaining that my apps can't work on their iPad/iPhone/iTouch.</p><p>On another note, I read that Apple is restricting the app platform to Object C because of their concern about the apps using their hooks for multitasking, which will be a critical piece of iPhone OS 4. Whereas this is still angering, there is a bit of logic behind this.</p><p>Of course, that doesn't have any direct relation to the outright refusal to have Flash in mobile safari.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, I'm like you in that I switched to Apple because I was tired of Windows "slowing to a crawl after a day" and having to run an anti-virus, anti-malware, registry defrag, etc.  What I don't understand is why you would want to go back to that?  So what if Apple doesn't want you to download third party apps.  Is it that big of an issue that you'd want to lose productivity over it?</p><p>Android had it's first malware app back in January.  How will Android be able to police this if you're installing uncontrolled third party apps.  Are you going to need to run an anti-virus/anti-malware app on the Android phones now?</p><p>One thing about Apple that I appreciate is that they know how to control their platform so that it runs smooth.  It's something that MS could learn a few things from.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well said. I think a lot of people who switched to OS X because of a bad experience on Windows, will be pleasantly surprised by Windows 7. It solves a lot of the issues with XP in terms of single apps locking up the entire OS. The performance is better, it takes advantage of more hardware. Overall 7 is a much better experience. Yes, moving back to Windows from OS X won't be easy, especially if you've come to rely on the CLI environment. But 7 will certainly be a platform that is better now than when you left. That much I can guarantee.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great write, Raymond.</p><p>I've used Mac for a little while about 5 years ago (purely for testing). Never understood Kool-Aid-Colored-Mac-Pseudo-Better-Designer?-Better-Developer?-Hype. In my 12+ years career as developer never had problems with PC that stopped my work and affected deliverables. Never bought and not planning to iPhone (successfully running HTC Touch HD at the moment) and iPod (Sansa Fuze 8GB + 16GB memory card works well, with FLAC too BTW). Didn't plan to buy iPad as well (IMHO - useless gadget, laptop has much more power, more screen estate etc., we are developers after all, not a pretentious pseudo-artsy drag-queens). And after latest Jobsy move will skip Apple for as long as I can (our family and as many people as I can influence that is).</p><p>Thank you again for a great write up.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Great post ray. What I don't understand is why people think going back to Microsoft is the only choice? Ubuntu 10.04 beta 2 was released today and it is moving smoothly. Final will be out on the 29th this month. The biggest problem at this point however is that cfbuilder will not work (although the betas ran great, seems like adobe is up to some blocking themselves). CFEclipse still works and you can go vote up the bug for getting builder on Linux @ <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfbugs.adobe.com%2Fbugreport%2Fflexbugui%2Fcfbugtracker%2Fmain.html%23bugId%3D79170%3A2nc9dPLYg6w9zeKkHGo01_swxbI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cfbugs.adobe.com/bugreport/flexbugui/cfbugtracker/main.html#bugId=79170">http://cfbugs.adobe.com/bug...</a></p><p>It will be interesting to see how this all plays out in the end, but it really seems like Apple has shot themselves in the foot today and with iPhone OS 4 just playing catchup with android.</p></div>

I'm sure Apple is very happy to sell you a MBP or Cinema Display... but they don't "Need" to.  The only reason Apple is still around is because of iTunes and the iPod.

Certain Flash apps undermine Apple's business relationships with AT&amp;T, youTube, record labels and publishers.  Don't think for one instant that the decision to disallow Flash is solely that of Apple.</p><p>Instead of saying that you're never going to give Apple another cent... take the challenge!  Learn C.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Regardless of whether Apple has a 'hidden agenda' behind their stance on Flash, I do agree with their reasoning behind eradicating it.</p><p>Flash, for as long as I can remember, doesn't enhance the browsing experience.  It is used in places it shouldn't be (flash intros, anyone?).</p><p>There are 'better' (subjective, I know) solutions out there now to give the same or similar experience without the bloat and other issues Flash brings with it (i.e HTML5).  Apple are simply doing what they did to the floppy drive - removing it because there is something better out there and people need a bit of a push to realise that.</p><p>Turning to Adobe, they should look at this as an opportunity - they make their money on the software, not the deployment.  They already have the tools to deal with HTML5 (Dreamweaver), they maybe just need to incorporate and focus them a bit more.</p><p>Adobe seems to have a habit of 'sitting still' and not ceasing the opportunities that present themselves.  Coldfusion is a fantastic example of that - a fantastic language, which could be so much better if they brought it to the masses (I'm talking pricing here!).  It's sad to say, if it wasn't for such a passionate community behind CF, it would have died a long time ago - outside the community and CFWACK books, there's pretty much nothing out there for newbies.  Look at PHP, Rails etc and you've got hundreds of books to choose from.  Now Adobe have CFBuilder, why not make the server free (or drastically cheaper) and charge only for the builder.  More hosting companies offering it, more developers developing (and heck, it only takes 5 devs to buy builder to cover a server licence).  More devs using it = more support, more coverage etc.</p><p>Sorry, I've gone off on a tangent there.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Agree with you on the whole "evil" thing...but I do think its fair to say they are playing dirty. I also think its fair to say that their behavior, as Microsoft's in the past, may actually begin crossing the line into illegal (in terms of anti-competitive behavior).</p><p>I also, however, don't think Adobe has done a good job of staying ahead of this issue. At every turn they seem to be caught off-guard and their responses seem unable to match the gravity of the situation (Apple has declared all out war from a business perspective but Adobe is still responding like this is a minor spat). Perhaps I am wrong and Adobe has some worthwhile response in the works and its just taking time but so far I'm not impressed with the response.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian, very good points. I was thinking along the same lines. While it is true that Apple is being a control freak it seems that Adobe thinks if they play by the new rules that Apple will not change the rules. When you play card games like Rook one thing we are all familiar with is the concept of "house rules". When it comes to the iPhone, iPad and other Mac products these all fall under the category of Apple's house.</p><p>Hey, look at Intuit. You buy their financial software and after so many years it stops working in some way. This is true of both Quicken and QuickBooks. My father had Quickbooks for business and we had Quicken and lived the reality.</p><p>Ray is right also... these companies have a right to do this. They own the products. It is because of these policies that Ray is also right... don't just complain. Vote. In fact don't just refuse to buy more Apple products if this seems like the wrong direction... consider the value of Google OS, Linux. Consider that no matter how bad they did getting there even MS has a good OS for this season. :) After all... we all know (though not all admit it) that Apple products are sold as much on snob value as being a better product. Seriously looked at a iMac quad core this AM and compared with similar windows system. LOL... it doesn't add that much value!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lots of comments here. Please forgive me for not replying to them all - but thanks guys for chiming in.</p><p>@Chris: Heh, I'm no celebrity. Maybe in our small community, but outside of it, I'm only cool to my wife and kids. (Ok, my wife. ;)</p><p>@Brian: I don't know - I think Adobe has been pretty aggressive lately. While we've not seen a formal response to this (Kevin Lynch mentioned it in his last blog post, but not very directly I think - don't have the URL handy), we have seen, over the past few weeks, multiple things that I think respond to the tablet/html 5 world. I'm thinking of the SWF/HTML5 perf tests, the 'touch screens cant do mouse over' things, etc. Lots of a very technical, very direct, counter attacks that are mostly code and less marketing. I think it's great. Not sure if it's coordinated or not, but it feels like it. I think we need a bit more time to see how much Adobe responds to the latest.</p><p>@Lee: You mention that Flash seems to be used inappropriately. You can apply that to HTML as well. If Flash were to go away tomorrow, do you not think we would still have annoying intros/ads/etc? They will just be built in HTML instead. (And be harder to block if you think about it.)  As for Adobe, they are doing quite a bit already in the HTML5 area. I think DWCS5 will demonstrate that. (Look at the MAX Sneak Peak last year in terms of Canvas support.)</p><p>@ToAll: On Monday I'm going to hook up my Win7 laptop to my normal keybord and screen, disconnecting my MacPro. It will force me to try Win7 using my normal input/output devices. Going to give it a real try. (As a side note, speaking of input devices, a good 10 years ago I got used to MS Natural Keyboard. I've used it ever since - even with my Mac.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Zarko: Resources. Mac accounts for - what - 15% of the market in general? Probably more for Adobe. But Linux accounts for (afaik) even less. Every platform you support typically means that much more effort to support. The code bases aren't going to be the same. So if it costs Adobe 1X more to support Linux and the return is 0.01% of what they get for WIn/Mac, is it really a lame excuse then?</p><p>Speaking from a strictly person point of view - I build my open source software to support the most recent versions of ColdFusion. BlogCFC, for example, supports CF6 and higher. I could support CF5 if I wanted to, but the effort required for the small return wouldn't be worth it. That's not lame imho.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's interesting to see the "Apple backlash" here and in other sectors. I've been an Apple user for close to 20 years now, long before most of the "fanboi" converts and I've also used every version of Windows since 3.1. Both companies have been accused of vendor lock-in and worse, many times. I think many of the recent Apple converts don't remember how terrible many of the Macromedia/Adobe products were on Mac machines over the years (things are much better now, but long-time Mac users have suffered at the hands of Macromedia/Adobe). I blogged at length about how unusable Dreamweaver was for several releases on the Mac - while I was working at Macromedia - and the Flash Player was an abomination on Mac back in the FP6/FP7 days.</p><p>My background is in compiler design and runtime systems. Long before the JVM, I worked on a portable (cross-platform) virtual machine for Pascal-based languages. I ported Microfocus COBOL to the Sun Sparc and the Motorola 88000 (originally the 78000). I've written math co-processing libraries and Transputer-based multi-processing language-to-language translators. The arguments that cross-compilers for iPhone cannot compete with native Objective-C have merit. If you write an application in Flash / Flex / AIR and cross-compile it for the iPhone, it'll run but it isn't going to be able to take advantage of all the native APIs and it isn't going to work as seamlessly as Objective-C / Cocoa apps - because it's targeting the Flash runtime and the cross-platform "common denominator".</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love what Adobe's trying to do in creating a universal runtime platform but the level of abstraction needed to make that work - on all platforms - automatically means some compromises have to be made.</p><p>Microsoft wants you to write Silverlight / C# apps for its .NET platform. Adobe wants you to write Flash / Flex / ColdFusion apps for its (cross-platform) platform. Apple wants you to write Cocoa / Objective-C apps for its platforms. I don't really see much difference between these approaches - as Hal says, they're all the same and we should know it and recognize it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am trying to be rational, and I can see Apples logic here. The app store has over 185,000 apps in it right now. A great number of which have been developed using 3rd party tools and frameworks, even a few apps that Apple themselves have advertised and demonstrated in press conferences and television commercials. Apple loves to brag about having more apps than any other platform, but the fact of the matter is, a great number of those apps are pure trash and the app store is very convoluted with duplicates. They want to ensure that apps are written using native apis and can give a consistent, quality experience. The flipside to this is a bad developer is going to write bad software regardless of the platform and tools used. You cannot assume that an application written using native tools is going to be good, and on the same token, you cannot assume that and application written using 3rd party tools is going to be inherently poor by default. I can see great value in quickly developing applications using your favorite tools and programming languages which can be cross-compiled to run native on Apple devices, even if they do not perform as well or use the latest and greatest features of the current iPhone OS release. A poor app that does what you want/need is better than no app at all, and most of what is developed using these tools are just simple games or consume internet services for content delivery. And these tools do compile down to native code using NATIVE API CALLS. How many of your iHhone apps have a consistent UI and work in exactly the same fashion? Forcing a developer out of their preferred environment is a good way to ensure you get poor software written for your platform.</p><p>What they have done here with 3.3.1 is simply anti-competitive. It has little to do with the the quality or consistency of the apps and everything to do with the fact that these tools can not only compile native iPhone apps, they can also compile native Android/Winmo/Blackberry apps at the same time, so they loose the exclusivity of those apps in the app store because if the same apps are available for all phones Apple must then compete on a level field where it comes down to price and features. This is something they just cannot do. As I watched the iPhone OS 4 press conference, every feature (besides iAd) being announced was just playing catch-up to where Android has been since day one, and Apple still has a long way to go.</p><p>I am sure I can safely assume that 80% or more of the people commenting on your blog are Coldfusion developers using Eclipse as an IDE with either CFBuilder or CFEclipse plugins. Do not forget that Eclipse is a cross platform application written using a cross platform toolkit as is Firefox, OpenOffice, FileZilla and i'm sure many other tools and applications you use on a daily basis. While Eclipse does have its own quirks, it is quality software, and there are very few other choices available to us. This also reiterates my point that a bad software that fills a need is better than no software. However, when you look at Firefox vs Camino, Steve's point is quickly validated.</p><p>They have been quickly losing developers and customers to Andriod. The new policies are not good for developers, which is not good for consumers, which in turn is definitely not good for Apple and this will only accelerate the movement away from Apple devices and iPhone/iPad/iPod development.</p></div>

For me, the only software I use that doesn't run natively on Linux is Microsft SQL Server Management Studio which I use to design the dbs for the sites that use a MSSQL model, this runs great in a Windows 7 VM. As well I also have my VM loaded with Firefox, IE8, Chrome, Safari and Opera in their default configs without plugins. This lets me easily test on all browsers and resolutions quickly and painlessly. Without using it as my daily os, it doesn't have to dealt with "Windows Rot" so it runs very quicky and I can restore from a fresh disk image in 5 minutes if needed. I also have another Windows XP VM with only IE6. If I were running Windows as my desktop, I would still have a VM for these reasons. With that said however, you should never be forced to run in a virtualized environment to do your primary work. And while the wine project has come a long way and I appreciate their efforts greatly, it is a hack, it is not a solution and I would never be foolish enough to recommend it as a viable option for business computing. I do have Photoshop 6 installed in wine though because there was a one off time where I had a client send a PSD which GIMP had opened with the colors pallete messed up. I spent an entire day building the layout only to present it to the client and find out the design was way off. It's never happened again, but now I still check them in Photoshop before I waste hours of time. If the software you need doesn't work for you, then it's not for you, enough said.</p><p>This is a time though where you can help shape that future for yourself. Go and vote up the bug I linked to before. Mark Mandel went through some great effort to get Coldfusion builder working as a plugin install to Eclipse on Linux. It worked great for each of the beta releases and I came to really love cfbuilder. I have recently switched my entire development team to Linux using Eclipse and CFEclipse. When the beta expired 2 weeks ago, I went to submit a purchase order to my company for several licenses, but figured I should check with Mark first. He was told his methods would no longer work with the final release, it worked right up until the pre-release version and then Adobe put in their blockers which seems to be an intentional move on their part. I understand the economics of not having a natively released and supported version, but I would have absolutely no issues with buying a Windows or Mac version, and installing it as an unsupported plugin on my Linux Eclipse. It seems this has been going on lately with all of the Adobe creative software CS3 and beyond, where most of their prior releases had a Gold or Platinum rating on WineHQ and the current releases as listed as garbage. It's OK by me if they no longer want our money, I am happy to go elsewhere or use free software. As for CFBuilder, as much as I enjoyed working with it, lately Coldfusion has been such a small part of my job (I do more Java, PHP and Python than ColdFusion now) I am fine using CFEclipse, and I will not let Adobe dictate my OS choice when another tool exists which [partially] works.</p><p>For WoW, you are in luck (as long as you stick with nVidia or Intel graphics), as not only does WoW run in Wine, in many cases runs better in OpenGL on Linux than it does using Direct3d on Windows, you can even use Ventrillo or Team Speak. Check Ubuntu Forums for a really good and simple how-to on getting it running. It is illegal to distribute Linux in the U.S. with the ability to play encrypted DVD's as the open source libraries which decode the CSS keys is against the DMCA, so yes, you must jump through and extra hoop and add the software repository which contains the libdvdcss2 library. Again, a very simple how-to is available on Ubuntu Forums. Unfortunately, accelerated graphics drivers are all closed source and do not have very good support for compositing desktops (desktop effects) with multiple monitors. The open source drivers are always improving, and are fine for business computing and multiple monitor support, but if you want to play the latest games, watch full screen dvds and have cool desktop effects you are stuck using closed with only good support for 1-2 monitors on the same gpu. I wish there was an answer to this, but those drivers are also always improving.</p><p>All this to say, that Ray unfortunate for you, it may not be the best solution, but for the majority of the people here that still use CFE and will not or cannot buy CFBuilder, only use 1-2 monitors or don't care about playing games, watching dvds or cool desktop effects on their work computers... it is more than a viable option if you are planning to leave the Apple camp and are not too excited to return the the hell that was once called Windows.</p></div>

I wanted to pick  on one particular thing you said though:</p><p>"it worked right up until the pre-release version and then Adobe put in their blockers which seems to be an intentional move on their part"</p><p>This is absolutely not true. The bits that were added were not "linux blockers", but licensing bits. These bits are shared across multiple products, and unfortunately do not work in Linux. I guess, technically, it still falls into the "intentional" category, but it isn't specifically an anti-Linux move.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Sean and Michael: I want to pick on one aspect of your comments, the Dreamweaver portion. Sean, you seemed to imply that DW _used_ to be pretty baf. Michael, you seemed to imply DW was still pretty bad, especially with the code rewriting part.</p><p>I was 'forced' to use DWCS4 about 1.5 years ago. This was for a series of articles on Spry integration. I was pretty impressed with how well it worked. I remember seeing the code rewriting stuff you speak of Michael, but I also had remembered that there were settings to turn this off. When I played with DW CS4 I did not see this at all, but I did check those settings first. Are you sure it is still an issue? When CS5 comes out I plan on installing DW and giving it a run through. While I definitely prefer CFB, I find DW to be a pretty darn good editor as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Different distributions do still use different package managers. There are 4 main package types deb, rpm, bin and source tarballs. Since the most commonly used distributions are mostly derivitives of redhat and debian then for commercial software you generally only need to worry about the first two. Most commercial software however is done in bin format which is just an executable installer (shell or gui) and skips the distros package manager entirly. This will work on all versions of linux and is how adobe (and most) currently package and ship software for linux. For everyone else, there is source releases, and chances are if the source is available someone has already picked up that source and made a native package for your distro of choice. So if you consider this a problem, then yes. Packages of one type can also usually be coverted to another.</p></div>

It's user friendly, innovative, with huge community, with their partnership with IBM and Dell, I'm sure future will bring only better and better releases.I wouldn't be brave enough to say to my administrator at the office that I want to switch from Win7 to Ubuntu if I wasn't sure that it's finally serious OS for office.<br>It's interesting that yahoo tv widgets SDK is distributed as .deb installer. So if you want to develop and test those widgets you have to use Ubuntu. <br>And yes, regarding drivers, I bought new notebook 2 months ago, without OS, win7 was recommended, I spent 5 days trying to install all devices on XP. Ubuntu was working out of the box.<br>So try new Ubuntu 10.4, it works well in VirtualBox, use it for couple of days, if you dont like it, don't switch. For me waiting is over :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>How intuitive are the Linux GUIs these days?  When I think of Linux, I think of an overwhelming amount of configuration needing to be done to every last tool before it can be used effectively.  Having said that, I switched to Mac OS X a year ago.  I'm now used to a certain amount of this sort of thing, and I do appreciate the granular control it gives me now and then.  Having said THAT, though, if I switch platforms again... I would certainly not pick something that requires even more of it.  And, in reality, the thought of going back to Windows to rid myself of some of it is actually a pleasant notion.  My career path, until last year or two, was a Microsoft career path.  I have an MCSE NT4 and served as Assistant Mgr of I.T. for nearly 10 years during which I did a lot of Windows server administration up through Win2k3.  I did all of my CF development on Windows operating systems.  In short, I just never had the problems people seem to have with Windows.  For me, everything "just worked" far more on Windows than it does on my MBP.  When I'm developing, I want to spend my time on coding... not fine tuning every tool I put into use... though I realize these tools require a certain amount of tuning, even on Windows.  I really love my MBP, but it's more for the change in scenery or "fung shui", if you will.  I'm over it.</p><p>Insofar as the Apple / Adobe battle is concerned... I've calmed down now and realize that something someone said up here a couple days ago struck a chord in me.  I'm a realist, and I get business and competition.  But what really peeves me about this whole thing is the way Jobs waited until the dead last minute to release the EULA.  We've known and he's known for a good while now that the technology to port was on the way.  Could he not have released the EULA much sooner and still have had the same or similar impact on Adobe?  I just think it was particularly and unnecessarily nasty to screw the little guys here.  He's let a bunch of independent developers --in a struggling economy-- put time, money, and effort into something he probably knew all along he was going to yank out from under them.  Why?  Sure, it's gotten a subset of people out in public debating how Adobe conducts business and blah blah blah, but I really think what he gained by doing that wasn't worth the ruthlessness.  Business is business, but c'mon.  Maybe I'm overlooking a larger strategy, but that's honestly what chaps my hyde.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Allen, because the licensing software that Adobe uses - across all their desktop products I believe (but certainly shared between CFB and FB4) - only runs on Windows / Mac OS X. That's not under the CFB team's control - Adobe's a large organization and has to consider such cross-cutting concerns in the context of the bigger picture. If there was sufficient demand for a large number of Adobe products on Linux - enough to warrant porting them and the licensing software - then we'd see CFB and FB4 on Linux.</p><p>Linux has definitely come on in leaps and bounds and I can see why many developers choose it for the desktop. For me, it's not quite there yet - there's a lot of software I like to use that couldn't be run on Linux and I still find many of the Linux tools a little 'clunky'. My background has always been Unix / Linux tho' - for servers. I've owned Macs for about 15 years and I've always run Unix on them, alongside Mac OS. Back in the System 6 / System 7 days, I bought a commercial Unix product to run on my Macs (that cost $500... or was it £500? It wasn't cheap: Tenon Intersystems' Mach Ten). I stayed on System 7.5.2 long enough to jump straight to OS X 10.1 so I've always had a Unix development environment, coupled with a slick Mac desktop environment for business / productivity software.</p><p>I spend money on what makes me the most productive. That's why I use Apple products. It's why I bought CFBuilder the day of release without any qualms. Yes, it all costs more than running a Linux system and CFEclipse but the convenience is worth that extra cost - to me.</p><p>I've also used every version of Windows since 3.1 - I just don't like it (but, like Linux, it keeps getting better with every version - Vista aside, that is!).</p><p>But now we seem to be getting a little off-topic since this was supposed to be about Apple's (sensible) business practices pissing certain developers off :)</p></div>

Apple apparently is not persuaded it can win by playing clean and has choosen to play dirty. It's time for a flag to be thrown because this is foul play. The Apple die hards are accepted by me if they feel like this is fair play. Doubt they have the same generosity to accept others who cry foul. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well said, Ray. I think a lot of us are in the same love-hate relationship with Apple as you are. However, I’d also try to rationalize, from their perspective, why Apple would make such a move:</p><p>1.	Performance – while I do not agree with Steve Jobs that “intermediate layers between the platform and the developer ultimately produces sub-standard apps” (his words), I do agree that cross-compilers produces non-optimized codes, at least initially, because cross-compilers are just abstractions and abstractions are always leaky, as Joel Spolsky explained so well: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joelonsoftware.com%2Farticles%2FLeakyAbstractions.html%3Awnk2mA2I4qv3xt5eSEmFBK_x36g&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.c...</a><br>It is like translating between two speaking languages; no matter how good the translator is, there’re always some meanings lost in the process. (That being said, most of us have not seen how the CS5 Flash iPhone packager performs, so the benefit-of-doubt should also be given to Adobe.)<br>2.	Time to market – As I have never submitted apps to Apple, I don’t know how long the approval timeframe is, but hearing from a not-an-insignificant number of developers, it is not a constant factor. So imagine when the iPhone packager becomes available, and suddenly Apple has a flood of 2x, 5x or even 10x of Flash developers all submitting their cross-compiled apps at once. Last I heard Apple has a 50-person approval team for the App Store; is this just a case of adding more manpower to the problem? And remember, the impact does not affect just the approval process but the entire infrastructure – billing, accounting, payment transfers to name just a few.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I think Apple is still wrong on tools restrictions, because it also restricts talents, and there are tons of them from the Flash community who can help Apple to sell more apps and phones.</p><p>What Apple should do is just LET THE MARKET DECIDES. Let developers write apps in whatever tools they want, and if their cross-compiled apps suck, end users will simply delete them and tell the developers so. And middleware devs will know when large number of their licensees tells them that their cross-compilers are crap. If they don’t improve, their middleware will simply disappear. LET THE MARKET DECIDES.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am in full agreement with everything that you said and I rarely agree ALL the way with anyone.  I have believed for a long time that Google was just plain smarter than Apple and that they had in fact become the new Apple.  So they had me at hello as far as their tech was concerned.</p><p>Apple's insane business practices and unwillingness to go any other route than proprietary on any venture has prompted me to wonder just how long it will take them to make some true and long lasting enemies.  What will they do when Jobs is gone?  At that point they will have lost the albeit rough, but seemingly effective glue that's held the company together and saved it on more than one occasion.</p><p>Most of Apple's products are pretty slick but I've always had a problem with them ignoring the corporate world in favor of focusing mostly on consumers.  If you're going to manufacture computers then perhaps you could come up with some viable business incentives for large corporations to standardize on them - wouldn't you agree?  Not Apple, it has always been Steve's way or the highway.</p><p>I had not thought much about the war lately so I'm glad that you brought that up - I need to work on NOT forgetting that many brave people are out there dodging bullets right now!</p><p>Knibb High School Football RULES!<br>(Sorry, Billy Madison was on over the weekend)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray:</p><p>You had some good comments, although I was a bit confused as to exactly what you are so angry with Apple about. No Flash on iPhone? Unsigned App denials?</p><p>The odd thing to remember here is that you are actually angry at a company. Why would that be? I'm guessing because in your heart you want it to be the super-successful, world-changing company that Apple proposes to be. When was the last time anyone actually got angry at Microsoft? They have been become a big, bland, business that makes similar decisions that get no attention.</p><p>My guess is that your frustration is because somewhere in the back of your mind, you are thinking "Come on Apple, you can do better than this..." Sometimes, I feel the same way. 90% of the time I agree with their decisions.</p><p>"The opposite of love isn't anger, its apathy." Apathy is what I feel toward Microsoft (and Linux in most cases). I just think it interesting that Apple's business decisions would get you (and others) so wired up - and I think its important to ask why that is.</p><p>There's my 2¢.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For me personally, it *is* partly, "Apple, you can do better than this" because I've been an Apple fan for so long. I've gotten frustrated at Apple at other times when they made business decisions that hurt them (the 90's were a painful time).</p><p>But in this case, there is a lot of angst over the fact that Apple is trying to use its persuasive clout in the industry to kill tech it doesn't like.. like Flash. As an Adobe developer, that makes me mad. Why *so* mad when MS or others would just as well like to see Flash go away? I suppose it's because a part of me is afraid that Apple will actually be successful in what it is trying to accomplish.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's more then a little ironic - Adobe is crying foul that Apple won't let them into the game when for many years Adobe kept Apple users at arms length. I love both companies and both companies can behave badly but this is hardly a one sided battle. I could ramble on but this blog post says it all - the shoe is on the other foot this time.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Joshua - I get your point. I guess my feeling is - if my computer makes me happy, I'm more productive. Happiness isn't directly proportional to anything scientific, or, shoot, real even. I switched to Mac cuz I wanted a change. I got a change. I think I'm ready to switch back now. Will I pump out more lines of CFML? No. Less. No. Will I be happier? Maybe. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I personally prefer to spread the "evil" doings of Apple to non-techy friends of mine. I feel that debating among fellow tech friends in person and online won't change Apple at all, but alerting people completely in the dark actually teaches them and makes them think, which could have some effect on their buying decisions.</p></div>
