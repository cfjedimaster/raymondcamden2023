		<div class="comment_text"><p>We had a similar choice lately, and were frustrated that Dell had so few i7s at the time.  We ended up w/ the Alienware Aurora (low-end model).  It had almost the same specs as the Dell, but came w/ more ram, a better vid card, and liquid-cooling, all for roughly the same price.</p></div>

But my primary gaming platform is the XBox/PS3, and I play Warcraft on my laptop. I did bump the video card up on both models so I had dual outputs (got a 30 inch and a 17 inch monitor).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been (and my company) a Dell customer for decades... and while I trust them with my business laptop and my servers, I've been building my own desktops for years. With a little bit of research, I can get the same features at a cheaper price but, better still, I can exceed what the vendor would give me and install the best component for my needs.</p><p>I've fallen in love with the new case from Antec (the Skeleton). Quiet, easy access and a work of art. Get all the ram, disk, video, sound power you desire. Start with deciding what cpu/graphics combo you want to go with and research the best bang for your buck (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewegg.com%3ACj9TjZIeIczQtT1sdGCwmTuN68A&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="newegg.com">newegg.com</a> is a great resource as is MaximumPC magazine). Then you add in your drives, sound (if not using mb based) and you get the fun of building it... with practice you can build out in two hours.</p><p>My latest build would have cost $2500 on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdell.com%3AwGjNTnQog5D-Dss0VCTc1TtpbuM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="dell.com">dell.com</a> but mine cost $1450 with more disk and better case/video.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've had a similar decision lately too, and from a support standpoint I used to always pick Dell.  Anymore though Dell has shipped their residential computer support overseas and I am not the most patient when it comes to that.  I still pick Dell for business, because we have the option to pay extra for their North American tech support.</p><p>Just to ask, did you look into Asus at all?  We wound up purchasing an Asus laptop for my wife A) they had a really good sale on Newegg when we purchased with a 3 yr warranty and 1yr accidental damage replacement  B) they had just started their own North American tech support.  Now I'm not sure if the tech support is only for their laptops, but just an added idea.</p><p>As far as the 2 systems you are looking at though, I'd go for cheaper (even though I'm not a big fan of HP) because I don't think either's tech support will be better than the others at this point.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>For the longest time I bought and recommended Dell because of their well earned reputation for good support.  However, the rumor was that their support took a nosedive a few years back and I can confirm from my end (after 2 crappy ordering experiences and 1  crappy service experience dealing with broken hardware).</p><p>This was a 2-3 years ago and they may have gotten their act together in the meantime.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We didn't go w/ the Alienware for gaming.  Side-by-side w/ the comperable Dell model, it was just better built, and almost the same price.  The extras it had really added to up to the system having a lot of staying power over time.  They are owned by Dell now, which was the most important factor.</p><p>We have zero regrets so far.  They are almost dead-silent, and power through every task w/o breaking a sweat.  Even when I do game, it never gets &gt; 30 C, all setting maxed.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Like you, I have had a really good experience with Dell support. My inspiron has had a number of issues (not good), but I get them resolved within 48 hours all the time. I also have two Dell servers that have been running 24x7 for about 6 years and I only had one problem - a tape drive that needed to be replaced. Once again, they had it replaced in 24 hours (on-site). So, Dell would always be the clear winner for me.</p><p>However, I am really curious to know why you are going away from Mac. I have recently been going the other direction - to Mac - even though I am ticked at them for the whole ipad/flash thing. If you would be willing to share this at some point - I would like to know your thinking.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray: I know you're not and yeah, I can certainly understand your point of view. The CPU / RAM selection is the most important part and I see you're gunning both of those selections to the max, so... I don't see you having much of an issue with anything there. I'm running Win7 on a (non-i7) quad core with 8 gigs of ram and I'm happy as a pig in mud for at least another year or so and I've already had it for awhile.</p><p>Only advice I suggest and this is completely optional, but I've used this to great success. Get a smaller primary 10,000 rpm drive and then use the terrabyte drive as your secondary drive. Anything that is non-critical, install on the primary. Everything that is critical, install on the secondary. I have 3 drives in mine at home, 2 Western Digital 10,000 RPM drives (One dedicated to OS, one dedicated to development / games) and one regular big drive dedicated for storage. I swear by the 10,000 RPM drives. They're noticeable.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, do you REALLY need all that power?  We all know you don't do Pshop Graphics - we have seen the samples -grin.  You likely are not going to be running more than one or 2 VMs at any one time.  So you need all that power for what? CF server(s) with a few instances, mySQL, maybe SqlServer and cfbuilder; with only one person banging on the box/instance/database at a time.  Save your money, go with the 8100 and 8GB of RAM.  You don't need a TB drive, you already said you have external storage; take the RAID dual 750GB drives option and sleep better.  If you were editing video or decided you were a graphic artist, then you need the power.  Take the $1,000 you are going to save and buy a low end server, no monitor, no keyboard and move your db(s) and cf server instances to that.  I am all for Tim Allen Power (grunt grunt) but you are buying a McClaren when a Porsche will suffice.</p></div>

I upped the RAM and the Graphics card in the workstation and have not looked back.  My workstation has CF7 onit, my server has instances for 8 and 9.  Server is a windows 2k3 SBS with 4 GB ram and runs my Excahnge server, CF instances, mySQL, SQL Server and Sharepoint and since I am the only one hitting it has cycles and ram to spare.  I'll never spend more than 1200 for a workstation again though I would spend 2500 for a laptop..</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I found a middle ground between buying from Dell (who I have used many times in the past with good results) and building my own.  Like you, I'm not that comfortable with hardware.  I bought from these guys a couple months ago:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avadirect.com%2F%3AB6YdBBRljmDQ6W4VGnj1VIK0Xqo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.avadirect.com/">http://www.avadirect.com/</a></p><p>Aside from delivery taking a lot longer than it would have been from Dell (there was a delay with one of the parts, and I think it was ultimately about 3 weeks before it was shipped) and I have been very happy with the computer I got.  I was able to build the computer exactly the way I wanted it, and it ended costing about that same as it would have if I bought all the parts separately on NewEgg and put it together myself.  The order total was $1553, and that's with a 160GB SSD!  Here are the specs:</p><p># ANTEC, Two Hundred Black Mid-Tower Case, ATX, No PSU<br># ANTEC, EarthWatts EA500, 80 PLUS®, 500W, 24-pin ATX12V EPS12V, Two 6-pin PCIe<br># INTEL, DP55WB, LGA1156, Intel® P55, DDR3-1333 16GB /4, PCIe x16, SATA 3 Gb/s RAID 5 /6, HDA, GbLAN, FW, mATX, Retail<br># INTEL, Core™ i5-750 Quad-Core 2.66GHz, LGA1156, 4.8 GT/s, 8MB L3 Cache, 45nm, 95W, EM64T EIST VT XD, Retail<br># CORSAIR, 8GB (4 x 2GB) XMS3 PC3-10600 DDR3 1333MHz CL9 (9-9-9-24) 1.5V SDRAM DIMM, Non-ECC<br># SAPPHIRE, Radeon™ HD 4350 600MHz, 512MB GDDR2 8000MHz, PCIe x16, VGA+DVI, HDMI, Low-Profile, Retail<br># INTEL, 160GB X25-M (G2) Mainstream SSD, MLC, 250/70 MB/s, 2.5-Inch, SATA 3 Gb/s, Retail<br># WESTERN DIGITAL, 1TB WD Caviar® Green™ (WD10EARS), SATA 3 Gb/s, IntelliPower™, 64MB Cache<br># SONY, AD-7241S Black 24x DVD±R/RW Dual-Layer Burner w/ Lightscribe, SATA, OEM<br># MICROSOFT, Windows 7 Professional 64-bit Edition, OEM</p><p>Notes: <br>- I really splurged on the SSD, but disk speed has always been the bottleneck for me.<br>- The i5 processors are a great deal compared to the i7's, based on my research.  <br>- At first I thought I wanted 12GB ram, but I settled with 8GB and don't think I will need to upgrade any time soon.  <br>- I am also not a gamer, so the video card is very basic -- and very energy efficient.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I just went through a whole ordeal with Dell, and I'm not entirely happy.  I've owned 9 Dell machines since 1997, this being my tenth.</p><p>I made the order on March 6th, and on the 19th I got an e-mail stating the order was cancelled.  I called and was told that some parts were out of stock and had to be replaced with different parts.  OK, a new order was placed by their system.  On the 27th I'd not heard anything so I logged into my Dell account, "Order Cancelled"..??? WTH?  I called again and was told there was an issue with my Dell Preferred account.  Had to wait until the next day to call as that dept. is only open 9-5 Eastern.  No issue with the Dell Preferred account, but the issue was that machine was no longer in inventory, they don't sell it anymore.</p><p>So I was transferred to a sales person, and explained what I wanted, based on my original order config, and was told it would be about $100 more for a similar system.  OK, that's fine... Got this machine on April 8th... Loved it... AMD x4 processor, 64-bit, 6-GB ram, 1-TB hdd... only thing missing from what I was sure I asked for was dual-video support, but they build sheet didn't have that so I ignored this and put in a video card with dual-support that I had lying around.</p><p>Then four days later the system was dead.  Power it on, and it stayed on for about 10-15 secs and then powered off.  I was on the phone with Dell for about 2 hours, trying this, trying that, and eventually the tech asked if I wanted to replace the system... and we'll up the memory to 8-GB from the 6 in there... OK, that will work...</p><p>Waited, then on April 23rd I was notified that the order was cancelled... I was really pissed at this point, as I should have just simply gone to Best Buy and bought something off the shelf!  Anyway, I called them again and now this model of Inspiron is no longer made...  UGH!   So the tech says that I can get a new model, nothing additional for me to pay, so I take the Inspiron 580, and since the MB doesn't support AMD I'll have to have Intel, again fine with me as I'm not paying for the upgrade... they ship it out and I got it on May 4th... two months after my original order!!!!</p><p>So I set it up, and argh!!! only 6-GB of ram... OMG!  So again I call, and the tech is saying stuff like you got a processor upgrade, etc., etc... and I ask him to look back through the notes of the last conversations I had and there it is, a Dell tech, and his manager telling be I'll get 8-GB... the other upgrades are on Dell as they machine is no longer made.  So he gets on with his manager, it gets OK'd and they send me another 2-GB...</p><p>So, now I'm happy that I have my new system, but I'm sure confused about my loyalty to Dell at this point.  I'm sure that I will buy from them again, but this was a hard situation to swallow...</p><p>Sorry for the length, but I wanted to let you know how my recent purchase experience went.</p></div>

Fastest computer I've ever touched.</p><p>I've literally ( not kidding ) owned a combined total of over 15 Dell desktop and laptops and I've got to say, their support and customer service has always been flawless.</p><p>That's not to say that their phone peeps don't monumentally struggle with the English language and communication, but they will take care of you like a newborn baby. I'm talking overnighting a new laptop keyboard to you for free if you chip a key take care of you, you basically just have to ask.</p><p>It's also worth checking out the Dell Outlet ( <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdell.com%2Foutlet%3AuPn2UU_rC4n9xe9qn_uxQm0ZJCk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dell.com/outlet">http://dell.com/outlet</a> ) if you care about saving a few $. You can often get the newest generation kit for 30-50% off if you look right. Since you don't give a fuh about PC gaming ( like me )  you might be able to find a superpower Precision workstation with a Xeon i7 ( not called that ) that might give you even better performance if you're running all of your serverware on the same box.</p><p>But the absolute MOST IMPORTANT DECISION you need to make on your new box is to pick up THIS ( <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntel-Mainstream-Solid-Package-SSDSA2MH080G2C1%2Fdp%2FB002IGT7IK%2Fref%3Ddp_cp_ob_e_title_1%3A-OT037PCjq4SDfaBjCUl_K8tU4o&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Mainstream-Solid-Package-SSDSA2MH080G2C1/dp/B002IGT7IK/ref=dp_cp_ob_e_title_1">http://www.amazon.com/Intel...</a> ) hard drive, and install Windows and all of your apps to it, and then keep a high capacity non SSD in the box as the data drive where you put all of your data and media. That organizational strategy will literally give you more performance gains than even that ridiculous processor and RAM config.</p><p>On my T3500 Dreamweaver, Fireworks, etc. booted from scratch in about 2.5 seconds the first time, 0 subsequent times. It felt like Windows 7 Pro 64 booted in a yawn and a half. So worth the money.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I buy Dell for my wife and for work.  For myself, I go to a cheap Taiwanese importer and get them to build me a PC.  If I want a high-end machine I might go to a gaming builder.  Usually I just go with the components they recommend, but sometimes I'll specify something.  I find the custom built PC with 3 months warranty to be of far higher quality and to last a lot longer than the Dell with all the warranty and support.  So if even rudimentary troubleshooting is a major headache then Dell's support is a lifesaver, but I always expect to be using it to the full, and I don't expect to get any more than the three years out of the machine.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So i'm a little late to chime in, but I will anyway. I think with the way that computers are being built these days, any manufacturer will be sufficient. I wouldn't spend $3K on a computer personally, I used to purchase like that, but I find that I get too attached and it's hard to upgrade later. If I was to purchase a computer based on brand alone, I really like Asus, i'm not sure if they make desktops or not, but it's worth looking into. I think they are better than Dell IMO. I just recently purchased a new desktop, a Lenovo which I wasn't planning on buying, but ended up buying it. It's super fast and Win7 64 is blazing fast with the 6 gig of ddr3. I run all my virtual machines on this computer, I don't install anything more than messenger apps etc... on the host machine, everything else is on virtual machines making the attachment to the hardware a lot less. This machine was $599, i added a dual dvi card and bigger power supply so that I can run the 3 22" monitors that I have and have not had any performance issues at all.</p><p>Anyhow, that's what I would do!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>HP support is the worst. I had a laptop with a defective keyboard. They insisted that, while on the phone with support, I reinstall Windows to see if that fixed the problem. This was after pointing out that I had the same problem while in the BIOS screens. :|</p><p>Ended up hanging up on them, and taking the laptop back to BestBuy, who exchanged it for me after a long series of tests &amp; conversations with the Manager. Whew knew Geek Squad would actually be MORE helpful than HP support?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd recommending staying as far away from the HP as you possibly can (which is sad, considering I used to work for them).  We've had nothing but trouble with our HPs at home.  My wife's finally gave up the ghost a couple of weeks ago, after only ~3.5 years of use.  She's now running my MBP from last year and I'm running a new i7 MBP :)</p><p>If you want the best of everything, wait for new Mac Pro's to be announced at/around WWDC next month.  It's been awhile since those have been revved and it's highly likely that they'll add i5 &amp; i7 CPUs to the Mac Pros at that time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,<br>Stay away from Apple! Please. Don't give that 'evil' company a dime. I have posted one of your recent blogs to a 400 + employee list and to many other friends. I think I have been able to influence a few people to stay away from Apple and I will continue to do in future.<br>About computer buying advice, well, it would be for poor people but here is what I have at home: HP Pavilion p6130 running Win 7 64-bit. 8 GB. 750 GB. Quad core AMD. Standard configuration delivered home for $567 in August 2009. It had Vista in it originally and upgrade had a few issues but they got resolved due to some online help at HP forum(I think something to do with NVIdia). The computer runs Virtual PC 2007 with Win 2003 Server and Win XP Pro. I have all I need for testing and rapid prototyping, including mock ups of ColdFusion applications. I run various eval server applications on my Win 2003 on my home DSL connection and have NEVER been hacked or had crashes or had trojans or virus etc. And I don't run a single anti-virus application either. <br>Pretty 'efficient' system. Your budget may be more so you can splurge a bit. Just stay away from Apple, Please!<br>Thanks.<br>Meengla</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>I know you don't want to build, but since you don't overclock, its dead simple these days. Go to Newegg buy a barebones system and add the other components. Quite literally it will take you all of 30 minutes to have the machine running (no os installed).</p><p>Also recommend Never, ever buy the top end CPU (GHz that is ) often the performance difference between the fastest and the mid-tier is less than 10% (more like 4%) but the cost is greater. Yeah its a writeoff but why not use the difference to upgrade components our add backup or software,etc...</p><p>PS. if you need help picking a barebones system , more than happy to help.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>So....</p><p>I want to thank everyone who gave their opinion. I really appreciate it. I just "pulled" the trigger on the Dell, although slightly tweaked. I went down one level on the CPU (the 960) since the 980 was really a waste of money. Final price was right at 2.1K and change.</p><p>I fully admit that I may regret this switch. If I do, you guys know I'll complain publicly as I'm known to do. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,<br>Windows 7 is a very good system. I have my HP workstation running multiple OS's just fine and I don't see any depletion of resources over several days as well as I have never been hacked. My system, at $567 (without the $230 monitor) is a great bang for the bucks! And now I see that 6-core HPs are out there for less than $1k.<br>But.. of course we will understand your decision. The world may end up with one person (not just a company--because that's what Apple is basically: A shrine of Steve Jobs) dictating what is the best platform and what is the best content for the platform...Yuck! At least I will not give up.<br>Meengla</p></div>
