Apparently some people think they have to work through the whole book in one sitting.  :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks Ray, I have just ordered my set. :-)</p><p>A question if I may: I currently have a few cf projects running under CF7 on my local dev machine and in shared hosting live environments. I didnt upgrade to CF8 for various reasons and now want to jump from CF7 to CF9.</p><p>Searching the web I see a few posts about upgrade "gotchas" and ideally would like to run CF7 and CF9 on my dev machine so I can maintain existing code while testing it under CF9. Or, maybe I should just install CF9 on another machine and copy my code across for testing.</p><p>What would you recommend as a way forward? Are there any lists of CF7 - CF9 upgrade issues/gotchas I can consult?</p><p>Thanks for your help,<br>Murray</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't normally run multiple versions, but I know folks who have. You need to use multiserver mode. If you Google, or search on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FCFBloggers.org%3AplHcC8aWdZbLWEVwlkHEwzxIcBI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="CFBloggers.org">CFBloggers.org</a>, you should find blog posts on the topic. I've done this like one time in the past five years so I'm the wrong person to ask.</p><p>As for gotchas - it's been so long since 7 I can't honestly say. I do know the main issue I've run into is new functions conflicting with built in ones. So for example, I know a few of my OS projects had to be updated for 8 and 9 simply because I used a CFC method/UDF that matched the name of a new function built into CF. In all cases though (I think 3-4 or so) it took like 5 minutes to fix.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The WACK has always been about getting someone who doesn't know CF up to speed on the language as a whole. It is not CF9 specific. It's written for CF9, but it won't focus on just what's different. Again, it assumes you know nothing. (About CF. ;)</p><p>So if your coworker already knows CF, they may want to use the Adobe docs instead.</p></div>
