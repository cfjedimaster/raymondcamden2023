		<div class="comment_text"><p>I always forget that you wrote that original, Ray, though I know it has come up before.  Our pastor likes to put the counter up on screen every so often with his personal countdown running while he speaks, and it can be a lot of fun.  "The statistics on death are very compelling: every 1 out of 1 people will die at some point."</p><p>Happy Birthday, and thanks for the fun little bits intermingled with the serious CF stuff over the years :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is bullshit.  First off, I've lost 52 lbs over the last year and the deathclock's BMI calculator still says that I'm obese!  I'm 5'11'' and I weigh 220 (all muscle ;0) - so yeah I've still got a gut and I still smoke a bit but I also play tennis, lift, etc. and I even ran a competitive 5 mile trail run (up and down big hills, through streams, loose dirt - tricky stuff) last month and I completed the trail in under an hour.</p><p>I quit eating fast food everyday because it is poisonous and I make sure to engage in some type of exercise EVERY day.  I also switched to 64 calorie beer (aka beer water).</p><p>So why then must I only live until 65?  Jeez, I'm 35 now and I've got a lot more left in the tank - "Things are gonna change I can feel it".  Anyway @Ray the deathclock reaper guy - I guess you'll be down one reader who actually buys stuff on your Amazon list come the year 2040.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am serious @Ray - and I've already dispatched my goons to Louisiana to get you to rewrite the death clock to favor my health conditions and give me a more optimistic prognosis.</p><p>Just kidding, how was your birthday - you really need to watch the South Park about Facebook and TRON - it was on again last night and it is one of the best episodes they've every written.  It's titled something to the effect of "You have 0 friends".</p><p>Ciao!</p></div>
