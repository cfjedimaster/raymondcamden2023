		<div class="comment_text"><p>I chatted with Dan Skaggs about his preso. I'd shown a little tiny hint of this in one of my Edmund talks a while back and apparently Chris Scott nearly fell off his chair... ColdSpring is an amazingly powerful tool and I think it can really help with workflow assembly. I was very excited to see Dan give a talk on that subject - and I'm glad it had the impact I was hoping for! :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, thanks for the kind words about my talk.  Glad that you got a lot out of it -- I certainly did myself re-researching the topic after shelving that topic for a 2+ years since I first did that talk at my local CFUG.  A lot changed since the original 13 rules were put in place.</p><p>For those of you that missed it, I will be present on my Speedy Websites talk to the Online CFMeetup on Thu May 6th at 12 noon ET.  Charlie hasn't publicized it yet, but I'll let the cat out of the bag now.</p><p>BTW, I was one of those Ubuntu users.  There were three of us that I knew of -- Matt Woodward, Jamie Krug and myself. Could have been a few attendees as well.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know I saw more than two. Matt Woodward runs Ubuntu (saw it during Matt's Grails talk), Peter Farrell runs Ubuntu (I think or some other distro) and John Mason runs Ubuntu (unless he needs something in Windows). I know I saw a few more, but couldn't give you names.</p></div>
