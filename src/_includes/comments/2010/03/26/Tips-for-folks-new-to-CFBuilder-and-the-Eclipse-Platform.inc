		<div class="comment_text"><p>I use a separate workspace for each of my projects (by which I mean each website I work on  -- each website can have more than one Eclipse "project" folder).  What I like about doing that is that the workspace remembers the files I have open for each project, and so I can jump back and forth between projects without losing my place in each of them.  This is very helpful for me because I need to jump from project to project A LOT, and I get confused easily.</p><p>The problem with this, of course, is that I actually want the same workspace layout for all of my projects, and so if I make a change to the layout in one, I want it to carry over to the others.  Eclipse solves this partially by allowing you to copy your workbench layout from one workspace to another when you switch workspaces (you need to select Switch Workspace/Other... to get that option).</p><p>So I don't use working sets to organize my Navigator.  I do use working sets to restrict the files I search over.  That helps to, for instance, eliminate a directory from search that has a huge number of small files I don't want to search.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm not sure it if is an issue in CFB or not, but I remember there being issues with Eclipse in general about leaving too many projects open. If you have many projects, close the ones you are not currently working in (Right click, Close Project). I believe this helps Eclipse manage memory better as it will ignore closed projects until reopened.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi all, Im trying to convert from dreamweaver to cfbuilder and have fallen at the first hurdle. I've tried to set up my first project and am having trouble getting my head around setting up my server. I have a dev version of cf9 on my pc and just cannot get builder to connect via rds could anyone point me in the direction of any examples on line. Is builder the same as dmwvr in that you can have a local server and a remote server and you put files from one to the other ?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, by verbs I mean POST, GET, etc. HTTP stuff. Your web server can be set up to explicitly block them. In your browser, try to clear your cache and your authentication cache. See then if you get prompted to login via IIS. Or maybe, temporarily, disable the security on CFIDE. If that lets you in, then you need to edit your RDS setting to provide BOTH the CF RDS password and what IIS requires.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray</p><p>Currently in the process of trying to switch from Dreamweaver to CF Builder... I'm having some problems I'm wondering if they are widespread... I'm running a 24" iMac, 3.06ghz core 2 duo with 4gb of RAM and CF Builder crashes any time I try to open large .cfm files that Dreamweaver can open in a split second.</p><p>Also, with Dreamweaver I can have 20 different files open and switch between and edit them at will, but with CF Builder, as soon as a few larger files are open at the same time, I can press a key and wait a full 15 seconds for CF Builder to respond to that single keystroke... Anyone else having performance issues with CFB?  Are there some settings I can tune?  Bear with me, very new and just started going through the various tips and techniques :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>OK, good to hear (I know it's not "good" to you but I mean diagnostically, it helps narrow the focus).</p><p>I would suggest that instead this then may be a heap memory problem. Have you looked in the logs for CFB? Either in the OS or with the Show View&gt;Other&gt;General&gt;Error log? They may tell when this is happening.</p><p>Or have you enabled the feature to watch the memory use? See Preferences&gt;General&gt;Show Heap Status, which shows a progress bar of memory usage.</p><p>Also, are you running the standalone or a plugin version? And have you installed other plugins? You may need to increase the heap size for CFB (or Eclipse, if you installed it as a plugin). Though Adam discussed this with respect to the beta, it may still help: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adrocknaphobia.com%2Fpost.cfm%2Fupdate-your-coldfusion-builder-beta-settings-for-flash-builder-4-beta%3A3IObbeSZRagiDnc3F9so7nrU4Tg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adrocknaphobia.com/post.cfm/update-your-coldfusion-builder-beta-settings-for-flash-builder-4-beta">http://www.adrocknaphobia.c...</a></p><p>I'll note that I also point to these and other troubleshooting solutions in in my Hidden Gems in CFBuilder talk, at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carehart.org%2Fpresentations%2F%23cfbgems%3AMBMq12REEG0usfOyBuvX8mKjLw0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.carehart.org/presentations/#cfbgems">http://www.carehart.org/pre...</a>, which you may want to consider before giving up completely.</p><p>Hope these are helpful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks again Charlie...<br>I have a standalone installation with no plugins installed by me.  I have read through your hidden gems briefly, but don't know enough about error logs to read or deal with them I'm afraid.</p><p>My heap on startup ranges from 35-52mb of 126mb used with no files open.  Around 60mb with a file open.  Any recommendations for heap settings I have seen I already have in place for the installation.</p><p>On startup I have two errors in the error log with a timestamp 3 hr 45min in the future:<br>Unhandled Event Loop Exception and<br>System property http.nonProxyHosts has been set to local|*.local|169.254/16|*.169.254/16 by an external source.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't know how Ray feels, but with all due appreciation for your dilemma, I'm not a fan of trying to have extended support discussions in blog comments...and especially when this has veered quite far afield of the entry's main point.</p><p>Really, this is the sort of thing you'd be best bringing up on the Adobe support forums (for CFB), and at least there you have a greater chance (though no guarantee) of Adobe folks watching. While they make no promise to support the forums, it seems reasonable that they'd want to avoid something like your problem lingering to give a bad impression. They may or may not be paying attention to this blog entry. Considering that it's nearly 3 weeks old, unless they were already subscribed to the comments, they may not be seeing this at all.</p><p>My main reason for pointing you to the forums is that I really have no more to offer based on the info you've shared. I have not doubt that there's more info available which could help solve this. There always is. These things don't "just happen", though it can feel that way when you're suffering it.</p><p>But really I'd assert that that forums are the right place to have such an extended support discussion. I will offer as a last point that I do also provide CF troubleshooting services as a consultant, <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcarehart.org%2Fconsulting%2F%3AT5qejZ-lEgiN_tHqRGNRohtBH0A&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="carehart.org/consulting/">carehart.org/consulting/</a>, and while I focus on CF server problems, I can help with CFBuilder ones as well. I've thought about offering a flat fee service to help people get past any one problem or using any one feature. If anyone's interested, don't comment here but follow the contact link on the page I just pointed to.</p><p>Hope that's helpful (and that all the other stuff I've shared makes up for the unseemliness anyone may feel about that brief "sales pitch" in the last paragraph. Just pointing out another place to find a solution, is all, when one is stuck. Not all problems can be solved well without more direct interaction.)</p></div>

I had the same thought myself, that it was neither fair or appropriate to continue this discussion here.  I do appreciate your assistance.  I will, as time permits, pursue it, but unfortunately for now I will have to go back to doing things as I had been before.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the update, and understanding. I'm sure I speak for Ray when I say we do certainly love to help when we can, and often if can be done quickly, so it was worth exploring at least for a few interchanges. If you may ever resolve things and think to point back here about what it was, I'm sure some would appreciate it. :-) I realize that's sometimes hard to remember.</p></div>

Read here for more: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattgifford.co.uk%2Fcoldfusion-builder-snippets%2F%3AzOWzfcmvmB8ZCO5SW4dc393-zuw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/coldfusion-builder-snippets/">http://www.mattgifford.co.u...</a></p><p>For #2, I use CFEclipse's concept of a "scribble" file. Basically, I just keep a file named "scribble.cfm" in a project and when I want to park code, I'll use "ctrl-shift-R" to pop up the resource finder, type "scribble", and hit enter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi, I'm new to ColdFusion and CFBuilder. I installed CF Builder 2 and ColdFusion 10 to learn to use both and I was doing ok. After the trial period ended CFBuilder reverted back to Express Edition and I could no longer preview .CFM pages in any of the two internal browsers (IE and Mozilla). I can only preview them if I change the the extention to .HTM. Is that normal of the Express edition or am I missing something. It would be weird for CFBuilder not to preview .CFM pages on its internal browsers....<br>Note that before the downgrade to Express Edition I was able to preview my code on either internal or external browser. Could anybody please help.<br>Thanks</p></div>
