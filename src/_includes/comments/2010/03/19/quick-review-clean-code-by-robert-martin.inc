		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm in the middle of this book and find that I agree with 90% - including the one on minimizing comments. He is almost demonic about making your code readable - refactoring. My to-read bookshelf now also includes Software Craftsmanship, The Pragmatic Programmer, and Joel on Software. (I know, I should have read The PP years ago...)</p><p>Here is a link to a great presentation done last month for the Vermont Software Developers Alliance (vtSDA) by Rik Dryfoos (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdidit.com%3AmgvAYIpqTl8yHqUKmc-UgISBGgg&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="didit.com">didit.com</a>) where he talks at length about good development practices and resources. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vimeo.com%2Fvtsda%3AQsE8AZiAmYub0U7l2G-yNyxE6As&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.vimeo.com/vtsda">http://www.vimeo.com/vtsda</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Excellent. I'll immediately start looking for the book. <br>Bad side of reading material covering so "subjective" topics is that I usually piss off and tend to argue, what I can't...quite useless doing it against paper :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I looked this up right after your recommendation during the preso yesterday.  (It's on Safari for those who have access.)  It is really helpful.  Dan's preso was very useful too.  Both will have me thinking differently while coding.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have been reading this book and it gives very good insights into creating cleaner more organised code.</p><p>As stated, i dont always agree with what he is saying, but believe his passion for creating clean code is admirable, as so many programmers just get the code working and leave it at that.</p><p>I have picked up some good tips so far, like creating short functions which only do one thing. Only issue is that im finding it more difficult to grasp as I go through the book, so in that sense it isnt an "easy road". But this something that is proclaimed at the start of the book anyway.</p></div>
