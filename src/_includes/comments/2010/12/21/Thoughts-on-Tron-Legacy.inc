		<div class="comment_text"><p>Haven't seen Legacy yet, looking forward to it.</p><p>A shout out for Tron 2.0, the PC first-person shooter... It's getting on now but I fired it up the other day and was reminded of just how brilliant it is. Really adds another level to first-person shooters, awesome graphics (still), a brilliant story and clever game play, plus the Tron geek-ness fully intact. I'm sure it's available cheap now, if you haven't played it, give it a shot :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Absolutely agree. Thought the story was so-so in terms of being fleshed out (Haven't seen the first TRON so I am not sure how it compares) but had stunning visuals and audio which alone made it worth it. My only complaint - I wanted more of the spectacular light cycle race. I plan to grab the dvd when its out.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Generally agree with your review. I really enjoyed it because the visuals and the music were awesome. Both myself and my son thought much of the best action was over way too early (the lightcycle and disc war scenes came early and ended too quickly) but they were well done.</p><p>I saw it in 3D at the IMAX.

I especially liked how not every second of this movie was in 3D, if more film makers took this approach I would be more on board with the whole 3D movement.  All in all a pretty spot on review.  Though I thought the final escape scene deserves mention as I thought it was pretty damn awesome.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw TRON: Legacy in 3D with a bunch of friends on premiere night.  I agree with Ray in that both the soundtrack by Daft Punk and the visual flair of the film are its most redeeming qualities.  I will also include 3D in that statement.  I'm not against it, and when it's done well I think it provides a very enveloping experience.  Granted, I have the luxury of seeing 3D films at AMC's flagship theatre.</p><p>For me and some of my friends though, that's where those positive qualities ended.  I felt the new film was completely bereft of any character.  The original, while rough around the edges, was a bit whimsical and at least had some charm.  Legacy is a visual and technological tour de force, yet a screenwriting flop.  The screenwriters bludgeon you with the plot as if you had but a couple brain cells to string it all together, and the dialogue nothing short of cringeworthy.  But that's Hollywood, and films like this are largely why I avoid most big budget blockbusters.  See it for the audio-visual experience if that's your thing, though don't expect much else.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I generally agree that the plot was good but not great, the iso's needed development, and the effects were fantastic, especially the vehicles in the climax. And I liked how Clu had just a bit of emotion at the end, some resentment and need for approval from Flynn.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>SPOILER CONTENT IN THIS COMMENT - I'm with you on the ISOs and see that as a small missed opportunity, especially when there was a hint that they somehow "spontaneously" generated. Would have loved even one more exchange of dialogue exploring how life of a kind is likely to spring forth from any complex system -- if in fact that's what they meant ;). Or, that they were able to be present because in Flynn's brain/identity there was some kind of correlative or embedded knowledge because he was in on some early phase of the genome project, etc. Plus, the only ISO we got to meet was pretty hot!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I always felt that if there were a "big bad guy" to the Matrix Trilogy, that it was either Smith or that ball of machine that Neo talks to at the very end.  The Architect (the old white guy) from the second film was just another program - a middle-man - just doing his job with regards to the anomoly (Neo).  And honestly, the ball-of-machine does remind me of the MCP.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My mom was the main buyer for Cray Research in the 70s and 80s. TRON used the Cray for a lot of the scenes in the movie. Because of Cray's involvement we got to see the premier at a large, old, movie palace in Eau Claire, WI. I loved that movie. FYI the first time I met Seymour Cray I was messing with the Wang computer in her office. Pretty cool for 1978. This guy comes in wearing a plaid shirt and jeans, empties the trash and is sweeping the hall. Mom pops in the office just then and says "Hi Seymour." He was a unique genius.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Ray. I owe a lot to Seymour Cray. He (through Cray Research) established an employee scholarship program that put me through college debt free. I often wonder where computing would be had he not passed. One last boring story. I was in the lunch room while mom was working and he came over to say hello. He started talking (he would get real excited) about the next generation of supercomputers and how they would fit on top of a desk. I had a hard time swallowing that one. :)</p></div>
