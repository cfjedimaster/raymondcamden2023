		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've been working with WireframeSketcher for awhile now (though admittedly I haven't had to do much wireframing during that time).  It's a really solid product made even more impressive by the fact that Peter is (I believe) the sole developer for the product.  And he continues to improve on it.</p><p>One nice aspect to working with wireframes within Eclipse (as one of my Java colleagues pointed out) is that you can tie the wireframe files to your project and include them in your version control solution.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond, thanks again for your great review! I hope this will make more ColdFusion Builder users consider WireframeSketcher.</p><p>Brian, thank you for your kind words! Yes, I am working alone which means that I can be much more efficient :)</p><p>Just a little note for those looking into trying WireframeSketcher. ColdFusion Builder and Flash Builder require some special steps when installing. Make sure to follow instructions outlined here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwireframesketcher.com%2Finstall_details.html%3AY9LIdjSfknW05e7YySh7mX7JUFk&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://wireframesketcher.com/install_details.html">http://wireframesketcher.co...</a></p></div>
