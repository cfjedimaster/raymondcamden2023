		<div class="comment_text"><p>You should try out JavaScript Design Patterns now.  The whole book is about Chapter 7 and they go to the extreme providing thorough examples of all the patterns.  It's a more abstract book so you won't see so much IE talk in it.</p><p>I try not to slam IE, since most of the problems are DOM related and not JS related (besides the non-conforming API, frame quirks and timing mechanisms).  It would be nice to get a serious debugger in IE.  In the same sense, FireFox has no debugger either as you will see how far behind Firebug the FF 4 beta debugger is.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You might be interested to read up on the history of JavaScript and JScript and why the divergence between the two languages occurred the way it did. I was surprised when I learned that it was not really Microsoft's fault that IE had a vastly different version of ECMAScript running than Netscape did but it was in fact Netscape's. In the early days JavaScript's copyright held by Netscape was enforced so Microsoft did their best to backwards engineer the tech, which resulted in JScript, now because JScript is a legacy technology they have to do their best to ensure backward compatibility.</p><p>I first heard this in a lecture by Douglas Crockford, author of JavaScript the Good Parts, and probably the most notable figure in the JavaScript community. You can view his lectures over at YUI theater for free.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually think IE8 is pretty solid in terms of JS (and not even that bad at CSS).  In IE8, I don't think I've ever had to work around a browser-specific issue in standards mode.  If my JS works in FF, it just works in IE8 as well.  Now that doesn't mean I don't hate me some IE6 and IE7...we've got a ton of workarounds in our codebase for those monsters.</p><p>@Drew - I actually find the debugger in IE8 to be pretty good.  It's not *quite* FireBug, but it's close enough for most normal development situations IMO.  What are your beefs with it?</p></div>
