		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh, and Spider-Man 2099.  :)</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comicbookdb.com%2Ftitle.php%3FID%3D1432%3AuhCZgNeugnuFYoZbTLdhocp2raY&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=1432">http://www.comicbookdb.com/...</a></p><p>Written by Peter David, who is a popular writer amongst comics and sci-fi/fantasy fans.</p><p>If you're looking for a good Spider-Man sandbox game, Ultimate Spider-Man (also published by Activision) is the best I've played thus far.  The storyline strays from the comic, which can be a tad confusing, but it's fun otherwise.  Probably more repetitive than Shattered Dimensions (you play as only two characters - Spider-Man and Venom), but yeah, just swinging around the Big Apple is plenty fun in and of itself.</p><p>It's available for the original Xbox, but a quick Wikipedia check says it's compatible with the 360.</p></div>
