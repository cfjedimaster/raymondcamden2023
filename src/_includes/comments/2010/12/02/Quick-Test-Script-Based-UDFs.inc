		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yet another reason for me to continue to write CFCs in tag format. I think I must be one of only a handful of people in the entire CF space that detests cfscript in general and script-only CFCs specifically.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I agree with @Sam that choice is good (personally I've been a tagger for so long that I'll probably continue to work that way).</p><p>And since we're talking about arguments, keep in mind that if you write everything in CFCs (and I pretty much do) and if you are writing your methods so that they can be consumed as web services then ALL of your arguments are assumed to be REQUIRED when your method is invoked from the outside world as a web service.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'd assume the code inspector would check this as part of the compatability checks... or does it?!</p><p>Personally I think this tweak in 9 is the beez neez. I've been a script monkey for years, so I'm onboard the new feature.</p></div>
