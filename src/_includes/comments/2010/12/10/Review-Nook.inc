		<div class="comment_text"><p>I, like you, have not paid for a book in a while. My in-laws give me B&amp;N gift cards for my nook - Black and White version. I love it for reading. I have about 40 books in it and it still doesn't weigh very much. Now that I heard your review, I might have to step up to the color one this holiday season. I heard initially it was not very responsive for turning pages, but that might have been with the initial release. I didn't realize it could do video too, a definate pluse.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice write-up, Ray.  I also have a Nook Color, but I haven't played around with the "non-reader" features as much as you have.</p><p>Even though the screen is beautiful and crisp, I was initially worried that it would still strain my eyes after a while.  But I read on it for several hours straight last weekend with no problems.</p><p>One of the nice things about the Nook platform is the support for the ePub format, which is one of the formats supported by the new Google eBookstore.  Despite's Google emphasis on the idea of storing your ebooks in the cloud, you CAN download an ebook purchased from Google onto your Nook using Adobe Digital Editions (a free download).  So us Nook users can get our books from either Barnes &amp; Noble or Google.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good write up Ray, definitely swayed me to get rid of my e-paper nook for a nook color.  Have you tried to look at any technical documents on it yet?  Like say, the ColdFusion developers guide?  Reading that on my old nook was difficult at best.  I'd love some screenshots showing how it renders code samples and diagrams.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The CFML Reference was a bit small. You can zoom easily enough. It's not "ideal" but more than usable... as a reference. I didn't try the Developers Guide which is more like a 'regular' book.</p><p>The Flex 4 book though was great. Again - a bit small compared to the real books you buy, but I think definitely acceptable. Graphics and code looked darn nice.</p><p>I get free books from ORO for blogging reviews (I'm hoping to review a JavaScript book next week). Next time I get one from them I'm going to see if they have an epub format instead of PDF.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good to see the positive reviews! I got a b/w nook for Christmas last year and love it...hoping Santa upgrades me to the color version this year. :-)</p><p>According to the website, your contacts list can be used for borrowing/lending books: "See something on a friend's bookshelf that you've been meaning to read? NOOKcolor makes it easy to borrow books from friends for up to 14 days. Just pull up your list of contacts, then browse a friend's NOOKcolor library to choose the book you want to borrow. Within seconds, NOOKcolor will send an email to your friend with a request to borrow that book. Once they give the ok, the book will appear right on your NOOKcolor in seconds ready for you to download and enjoy."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I got a Nook Color this year as well.  Like you, I've found the device more useful than I originally anticipated.  I especially like the fact that you can order books from more than just a single supplier.  For example, you can purchase ePUB formatted books from O-Reilly that are slightly less expensive than the same titles from BN.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice, Ray. :) I'm pretty happy with my e-paper Nook, but then, it saved me the trouble of carting a few hundred books down to my new job. And I already had a few hundred epub files laying around that I'd been reading on my iphone. But I got tired of interrupting my reading, and being unable to read and chat with someone online at the same time, so... Nook.</p><p>If you want a really nice, high quality cover, check out <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Foberondesign.com%3A8OpDqutAsG5-Q8xNLKs1S_aiuX8&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="oberondesign.com">oberondesign.com</a>. I've been using their products since about 1996 (journal, planner, wallet, checkbook, bookmark), and giving assorted friends their refillable journals as gifts for years. I ordered a Nook cover for myself for Christmas. They're gorgeous, thick, hand-tooled leather. I'm doing bold celtic to match all my other stuff, but they were kind enough to let me do it in chocolate brown even though they don't offer that design in that color for the nook, because it's what I have on all my other stuff from them. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@JC: Those covers are really nice. I wanted to get one the same day I got the Nook, so I bought the Vasco Cover model from B&amp;N.  The front flap uses two magnets to stay closed (no need to fiddle with an elastic band), and it folds over to the back quite nicely for reading.</p></div>
