		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's certainly nice to have an update - though this seems more of an introduction for people that haven't already been following along. Which isn't a bad thing, however it would be good to have a concise summary of the changes since July added to the opencfml website, along with some rough indication of when we can expect more information on CFML2009. (Or CFML2010, I guess. Perhaps a name like CFML9 or CFML10 would avoid the year issue)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Good point on the web site. Even if it just linked to Rob's article, an update would be something.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Peter,</p><p>More updates will be coming as part of our efforts to be transparent.</p><p>As for the title of the spec, it's purposely tied to the date as we're aiming to release a new spec every 2 years.  We'll be working on the CFML2011 spec going forward.</p></div>
