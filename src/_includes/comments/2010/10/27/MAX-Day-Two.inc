		<div class="comment_text"><p>@MattW: Yes. ;)</p><p>I'll add another note. They sneaked a tech that was meant to make code nicer to look at. It was very... interesting. It did stuff like make method names bigger, use a block bg for comments, and added HR rules around blocks. It sounds horrible - and my buddy Jared hated it - but I thought it was pretty interesting. I could see it being really nice the first time you read a file. As for working in it, I don't think I'd like it.</p></div>
