		<div class="comment_text"><p>As I have moved away from ColdFusion, I have become very comfortable with console.log.  It allows recursive traversal, but you may need to add console.log to your code (no worse than including debugging plugins) or using line breaks to get not just a single variable, but inspect the entire scope chain.  These tools have been getting better and better, which is probably why fewer people are working on dump plugins.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Is this the latest on the jsDump front, or have there been any new developments?  There are some comments with the jQuery plugin such as it doesn't work with FF 4.</p></div>
