		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - saw your comment about Motorola/Flash, etc. When did Flash become a requirement to use the Internet? I'm not necessarily anti-Flash (depends on situation), but the idea that the Internet/web can't or doesn't exist without it doesn't fly...</p><p>Just sayin'...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>Thanks for the blog, I love a knowledgable and practical perspective on all things CF (and maybe Adobe at large now?)!  I was at MAX, and AIR sure looked like the lightweight competitor vs. jQuery/HTML5/CSS - d**m easy to use, but I didn't see how one could write an AIR app that would perform equally on all form factors (mobile, smartTV, iPad, etc.)  Did you hear anything in the conference where that point of weakness in Flash might be addressed?  I hope so - I loved the AIR BYOL's I went to but I'm having trouble justifying it in a business case.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, thats a lot of questions in there Matt. I'll try to hit them up, and if I forget anything, let me know..</p><p>"but I didn't see how one could write an AIR app that would perform equally on all form factors (mobile, smartTV, iPad, etc.)"</p><p>Is your question asking about how well AIR code could handle the different platforms? If so, my understanding is that AIR code focuses more on capabilities then platforms. Ie, you don't have code saying, if(tv), but rather if(size of screen is smaller than some limit). You don't have: if(iphone 4) but rather if(geolocation enabled). So you still do have to consider multiple platforms - you never will get away from that - but I think the framework goes a long way to making it more agnostic - or more high level perhaps - then how things may have been done in the past. Please remember I'm still a newbie at AIR myself. I'm extremely interested in it - but I'm no expert.</p><p>Um actually - that was your only question I think. Just let me know. :)</p></div>
