		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the problem is you went from playing CODMW2 MP and jumped into Reach's MP. CODMW2's MP is one shot kill with almost every weapon. I have always thought Halo is more skillful than COD for this reason you have to have well placed shots to take down their shield and then finish them off with another well placed shot. If you just use the assault rifle and spray you are probably not going to get a kill. Or get lucky and finish off someone else's kill. The DMR is where it is at a couple head shots from that will take the shields down and then one shot to the head once shields are down will be an instant kill. As for ranking up you should complete the daily and weekly challenges to rank up faster. You can't just solely play games and expect to rank up. Especially if you don't do well in the games you won't get a lot of credits. Yes rank doesn't really add anything but does it really ever? In CODMW2 you rank up unlock guns and then prestige and lose them. Understandably there are more guns in CODMW2 so unlocking them isn't that big of a deal. There isn't enough guns to unlock in Reach so it doesn't make sense to unlock as you go. Firefight is really fun for multiplayer if regular matchmaking frustrates you. Get 3 friends and play that can be fun since enemies aren't hard to kill.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You fell into the n00b trap.   When you first start multiplayer you are at the lowest rank which is fine, but...   You are also at the same rank as everyone else who just started.  This includes the generals of Halo 3.   People who are just THAT good.  They will eventually boost past your level.  Your rank won't level out to playing with people your skill in only 2 hours of play.</p><p>Your arguments against Halo are my arguments against COD.  Getting the jump on someone doesn't equate to skill in a one shot one kill game.   Weapons combos, head shots, strafing and using your load out specials brings a lot more to a game then just running and gunning.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Fair points all - and I want to try Firefight more. But to be honest, if I'm just not good enough for Halo MP, I'd rather not waste time on it and just do COD. ;)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>If CODMW2 is like the best action film, and Reach is like one of the best Spielburg films, I wonder what Mass Effect 2 would compare to...?? Maybe like playing through an excellent action-packed SciFi novel? :P</p><p>I had a blast with Reach! :) My favorite part of Reach is playing cooperatively through the missions though. Nothing like taking down a horde of the Covenant with a buddy!! I am not much of a solo shooter player...unless we are talking about Mass Effect, but then, that is not *just* a shooter.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I thought Mass Effect 1 was -very- well done. I played ME2 for about 5 hours or so and dropped it. Not forever - certainly. But I'm kinda unsure if I like it. I felt like they kinda dumbed down some things a bit too much. Especially the whole "when the quest is done, you are done, period, no looking around for items you may have missed" part.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is what I hear a lot. No, you can't run around after a quest and look for items, and it kinda sucks that some areas are inaccessible unless you're on a  mission there. You also can't spend hours customizing your guns and armor. I loved ME1, but in my opinion ME2 is a better overall game.</p><p>In my opinion, the gameplay is more fun (a lot less glitchy), the character development is better and the characters themselves are much more interesting. The level design is much much better - if you remember most side quests in ME1 looked kinda the same. Even the missions themselves are just as, if not more interesting and I am excited to see how some of them tie into ME3!</p><p>In fact, one of my buddies complained about the changes a lot when he first started playing ME2...he ended up playing it 3 times in a row. But I think for the third time he just wanted all of his teammates to survive.</p><p>It's worth the gameplay, they just shifted the focus to have fewer RPG elements and more shooter elements. And planet scanning is boring too - but you can still find bonus missions by doing it.</p></div>
