		<div class="comment_text"><p>I read your blog about this when you posted it last week, but commented to myself "I've never gotten a flood of emails, guess I don't need this".  Then of course, last night my inbox was inundated with 400+ emails.  Re-read your post this morning and got it implemented right away.  Thanks a lot for this helpful tool!</p></div>
