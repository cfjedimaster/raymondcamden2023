Unforunately; CFBuilder isn't working anymore. No color highlights; no tag completion; nothing) I cannot enter any serial number or select trial mode; the 3 menu items beyond "Help" ("Adobe ColdFusion Builder Registration", "Adobe ColdFusion Builder Deativation" and "Adobe ColdFusion Builder Updates") are all greyed out.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I finally starting using at the end of beta, and I'm loving about 90% of CFB.  The problem is coming from Studio and then DreamWeaver, I have some work habits that are hard to break.  The things I could really use from CFB to make a switch really work:</p><p>1) Add Code Assist for CF functions.<br>2) Add keyboard shortcuts for snippets (and have them wrap properly).<br>3) Allow keyboard shortcuts for other things like html code.</p><p>All in all, I think it's going to hurt Adobe a little not having things be more transition-friendly from DW, as I think a lot of folks like me switched to it by necessity after CF Studio ended development.  At least in that case, DW practically had CFS built-in.</p><p>I really do look forward to switching.  The code-checking alone pays for itself.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Chung: This is my biased view. I have not used CFEclipse since I switched to CFB about 6 months or so ago. To me, CFB is better. I've heard that CFE has had some movement lately, updates, etc. So I can't say I've compared the two. There IS a competitive chart that I'll be showing in my presentation. Obviously it shows CFB in the lead.</p><p>Frankly, 299 is cheap for what you get. I use it every day, 8-10 hours a day. It makes me productive and lets me get my job done.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I really like CFEclipse, especially all of the new features that have been added as of late (code insight improvements, code formatting). So, I would really like to see something a bit more quantifiable when comparing CFEclipse to CFB. I don't use Flash/Flex so I am not sure $299 for a bundled product is worth it for me. But I get the point of them trying to push both products to the development community.</p><p>@Ray, that chart you were mentioning that compares the two ... will you make it "public" after your presentation. I would love to see how the latest releases of both CFEclipse and CFB stack up.</p><p>@Ray As a side note, I know you are not beholden to any one open source movement, but just curious why you chose to move to CFB from CFEclipse given your propensity for many open source initiatives (including some awesome products of your own). Was it simply a choice because it was a new CF product that Adobe was supporting or did you find CFEclipse lacking in some areas that CFB fulfilled? Just curious, especially since I know you have used both.</p></div>

For me, CFB works best. I've heard CFE has gotten some nice new features lately, but as far as I know, CFB is the best thing out now for CF developers.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray - thanks for the chart and explanation. Was just curious on the big differences. The chart really helps visually see what is missing (and what is not) from CFEclipse. Thanks!!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray - I've been using (CF)Eclipse for a quite a while now with the free release of Aptana Studio which gives you code context highlighting for a lot of different file formats that I use in my applications (css js xml) in particular css code assist/insight and also FTP/SFTP support. Including a comparsion of CFEclipse with Aptana (free release) might be a fairer comparsion.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The only thing making me use CFE instead of CFB is &lt;ctrl&gt;+enter not inserting a &lt;br /&gt;.  If I could map that command to those keys it would be perfect.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm with Martin Aptana plus CFeclipse.  I use my laptop half the day, and my desktop the rest. Some days I'm at a different location where I use my linux machine. I wish the license was tied to the developer and not a few machines. Anybody have $900 so I can write some code ($299 x 3 machines)? I do have a question, does anyone know how I can get coldfusion 9 help files &amp; code assist in cfeclipse? Adobe only has coldfusion 8 extensions.</p></div>
