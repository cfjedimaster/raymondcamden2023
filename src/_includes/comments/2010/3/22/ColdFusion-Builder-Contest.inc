		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey Ray, am I missing it, but do you mention here how to post a submission? Should they submit them via your contact form (link in the top nav bar)? By email, if they know your address?</p><p>Also, when you say "new" content, do you want to elaborate? New as in, it can't be something that was created and posted online before the opening date of the contest?</p><p>If you decide to open that up, would you also be ok with people submitting things they find that are created by others (for the creator to be nominated, in effect)?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I did not say - and thank you for bringing it up. I should have. Folks can email me at ray at camdenfamily dot com.</p><p>New - Yes, I do not want something that is already public. I'm willing to bend a tiny bit on that, like, something you may have shown coworkers, but in general, it should be new to the public.</p><p>Nominations: Um... I don't know. :) It seems a bit weird. If you see something that is cool, I'd probably suggest you urge them to submit it themselves. I'm not saying no, just... mostly no. :)</p><p>Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense.</p></div>
