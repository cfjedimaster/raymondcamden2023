		<div class="comment_text"><p>That is *very* cool because it opens up a ton of possibilities.    A little off point, but is there an advantage to using Aptana vs. Flash Builder?  Or is it free vs. paid, or just personal preference?    I'm noting your series of HTML Air apps and will run through them in a couple weeks when things slow down.  Also looking forward to learning more about AIR at MAX!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think you can use Flash Builder to build HTML/AIR apps. I could be wrong. I used it when I wrote my AS library because, even as simple as it is, it's not a language I use every day so I wanted to ensure I didn't do any stupid syntax errors. Obviously though I could have written it w/o FB.</p><p>All Eclipse based tools can share one install - but I don't like to do that. So I use standalone editions of Flash Builder, CFBuilder, and Aptana. It just works better for me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As far as I can tell (based on the info here - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fdevnet%2Fair%2Fajax%2Fgetting_started.html%29%3ATkdGgdl3oGaShZyKVMutyXOa3vo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/ajax/getting_started.html)">http://www.adobe.com/devnet...</a> AIR HTML apps can only be developed using Aptana by way of a plugin or an extension for Dreamweaver CS4 or CS5. Would be nice to have the AIR support in Flash Builder though.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nope, you don't need anything. All you need is the SDK. If you watch my preso (see the AIR category), I talk a bit about doing these apps "by hand."</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, I meant if you wanted to use an IDE similar to Flash Builder - the options were Dreamweaver and the plugin for Aptana. Obviously you can hand code if that floats your boat ;-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, any IDE would work - but if you want the -one click to run- option, yeah, Dreamweaver or Aptana. You can also use CFBuilder. Out of the box it supports 1.5. Andy Mathews discusses adding support for AIR 2 here: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.andymatthews.net%2Fread%2F2010%2F08%2F16%2FAdding-the-AIR-2.0-SDK-to-ColdFusion-Builder%3A97PbN1SDh2FGPRTBIDVdeq-Cfh4&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.andymatthews.net/read/2010/08/16/Adding-the-AIR-2.0-SDK-to-ColdFusion-Builder">http://www.andymatthews.net...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>FWIW,</p><p>Some time ago, there were a couple of TextMate bundles for AIR development as well.  Essentially, any tool that can be extended to interface with command-line tools, can be extended to work with AIR.</p><p>Since Flash Builder is all about Flash development, it doesn't really make sense to have HTML authoring as part of the package.  Builder is Eclipse-based however, so you can plug most other HTML development extensions into it.  And to be clear, Builder does include publishing for AIR, but only with Flash technologies.</p><p>Is there another IDE/workflow you'd prefer?</p><p>Thanks,<br>Kevin Hoyt<br>Adobe Systems, Inc.</p></div>
