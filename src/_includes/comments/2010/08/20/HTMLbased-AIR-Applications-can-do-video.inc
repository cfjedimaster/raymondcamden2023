		<div class="comment_text"><p>I forgot my PS I alluded to above. I've been doing a _lot_ of AIR stuff lately and not much ColdFusion. This isn't intentional obviously and I definitely want folks to continue sending me ColdFusion questions. I don't know if people were bugged/wondering/whatever but I thought I'd just remind folks. :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Video chat is possible with AIR on the desktop and on devices.  It is also possible with Flash Player in the browser (on the desktop and on devices).  If you're using Flex, you reduce development time even further.  Here's one done in 30 lines of code...</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoenraets.org%2Fblog%2F2010%2F07%2Fvideo-chat-for-android-in-30-lines-of-code%2F%3AZPs2B8E2ubLAQ61uHM_qYMhGykM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://coenraets.org/blog/2010/07/video-chat-for-android-in-30-lines-of-code/">http://coenraets.org/blog/2...</a></p><p>The above example uses LiveCycle Collaboration Services (LCCS) - collaboration in the cloud, so you don't even have to setup or manage a server to make this happen.  If you're leaning more towards the HTML/AIR route, then LCCS can still work for you, but it'll take a few more lines of code as you'll be accessing the API directly, and not the components.</p><p>Hope this helps,<br>Kevin Hoyt<br>Adobe Systems, Inc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, I haven't used that plugin so I don't know what it could be. It has also been many months since I've used AIR. That being said, if I had to bet I'd guess it is something involving the security context with HTML AIR apps. My memory is real rough here, but if you run the app from the command line using adl, do you see error messages printed?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Dreamweaver extension is simply wrapping calls to the AIR SDK. I strongly suggest you take some time to learn the command line tools so you can run ADL at the command line and see if anything is reported there.</p></div>
