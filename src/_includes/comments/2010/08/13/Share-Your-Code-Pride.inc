		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of my favorite days of the month was when my copy of "Run" magazine would arrive. I'd immediately boot up my C64 and test all the snippets of code that were in the front of the magazine (they used to have a bunch of 5-30 line snippets that did something cool.) I'd then set about writing a program around my favorite snippets.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The "best" code I remember writing was for a college programming course. It was an algorithm to build a tree from a pre-order and post-order list. There was nothing particularly complicated about it, but it was the assignment on which I grokked recursion. I have tried to save the code, but 20 years after the fact I'm not sure if it's still with us :(</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My first code was in FORTRAN, run on an IBM/360 mainframe, on...punchcards. It taught the novel concept of conditionals and simulated a vending machine. Add 50 cents, buy something for a quarter, get a quarter back, etc. Wasn't exactly interactive like a real vending machine. I had to punch out data cards, add them to the stack with the proper JCL, run them through the card reader, then wait until the geek behind the cage handed me my printout. Still, it was pretty cool to be able to make a computer do what you wanted, and I'm still doing it.</p><p>Ray, there is an interactive fiction language (remember Infocom games?) called Inform 7 that looks something like what you've written above. I gotta say that it's one of the most interesting languages I've ever seen.</p><p>Example:</p><p>    The Editor's Office is a room. The desk is a supporter in the Editor's Office.</p><p>    A red pencil is a kind of thing. 12 red pencils are on the desk.</p><p>    A letter is a kind of thing. 12 letters are on the desk. Understand "correspondence" as a letter.</p><p>    Rule for printing the plural name of a letter:<br>        if the listing group size is greater than 7, say "correspondence";<br>        otherwise say "letters".</p><p>    Rule for printing a number of something (called the target) when the listing group size is greater than 7:<br>        say "[one of]some [or]various [or]an assortment of [at random]";<br>        carry out the printing the plural name activity with the target.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, we must be about the same age.  I have similar memories.  The Infocom games were the best (zork, planetfall, etc..) The old GOTO 10 in BASIC were always fun, but the first coding I did that I was proud of, was a program I put on all the computers in the school library.</p><p>It would ask the persons first and last name.  This was in a very small rural middle Georgia school so it was not hard to put every person in the schools name into the code.  Then the computer would ask,  "Would you like to know what  I think of you?"  Invariably they would say yes.   And the "Computer" would tell them something about themselves.  Most responses were nice, many were funny, for a select few they were very bitting and bit to close to the truth.  Each day I would keep adding new possible responses, so they were not the same every time. Eventually, dozens of kids would be standing around the computer, laughing their heads off.</p><p>A few kids got a little "freaked" that the computer knew such stuff about them.  This was couple years after the Wargames movie and people had unrealistic ideas about what computers could do.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I actually think the code I write nowadays is what I'm most proud of, but if we're talking 'Old Skool' it'd have to be the word processor I wrote in BASIC for the Amstrad CPC464 when I was a kid. It was incredibly simple, but it did the job. I managed to get a few different fonts in there and search functionality too.<br>Another great moment was when a teacher told me there was no way to print in Cobal (Cobal? Really?!), which I then did by outputting the contents of a file to lpt1.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I once spent at least a month writing a finite state machine that did character pattern matching that couldn't be done using regular expressions. I remember being blown away when my code actually worked!!! It took the definition of a character pattern (similar to regex) and compiled it into a finite state machine (a binary tree structure). As the code parsed the data, it was pointing to a "current state" in the machine (or a node in the tree), which determined what to do next. Definitely the geekiest code I've ever written!!!!! But also pretty cool.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I've written lots of cool things in ColdFusion, which I must say is my favorite language. But my most memorable code not really my best, makes me smile every time I think of it. It is some code I wrote in PHP, let me explain.</p><p>When I worked for a major cable,internet,phone provider we had these systems that monitored the network and a user had to go over it to find problems. This information was all stored in a DB, so I wrote some code to pull it and based of some mathematics it would let the end user know if there was an outage in the system. This made my job easier I just surfed the web till my software told me I had to work. Worked like a charm, I literally did nothing for 3 years till bosses found out and promoted me to work on other stuff.</p><p>Here's the really cool part that makes me smile. The code has some javascript in it that when you hit (c) a popup would open up. What opened?</p><p>An animated gif of John Travolta doing disco with a midi file file that plays Do the Hustle, with a nice, not so safe for work message.</p><p>Why the (c) key well the page has info users need to copy sometimes they miss the control key and my popup opens. I still have friends there and my code is still running and every now and then they say people find it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of my proudest bits of programming was also one of my first. I had a VIC 20, and a 300 baud modem. I cooked up a short BASIC app to sequentially PEEK into a block of memory, and write it over the modem, to the recipient, who would then POKE the info into their VIC 20. I used it to successfully transfer an assembler prog I had hand-keyed in from a magazine. The guy on the other end of the phone had to hand-key in his part of the modem prog, but after that, in a few minutes, he had a copy of a nice space-invader app running, and he was then able to save it off to cassette. Sort of an interactive FTP, if you will. 30 years ago. Whew!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The first "real" program I wrote was to take wire list data from an AutoCAD program written in LISP by someone else that generated the wire list data and then formatting it in raw postscript to push to a postscript printer on the floor.  This is back when a 40MB harddrive was a big deal. After I saw the first published print out of a wirelist from that program, I was hooked and have been programming ever since.  It was probably the hardest damn thing I ever tried to do.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think one piece of code I'm most proud of is a merge field parser for a mass emailing piece of an application I worked with for over 4 years. It was a CF component that took a user's email text, parsed and executed it, then sent out the parsed result.</p><p>Although a pretty basic lexical analyzer it supported basic merge (data) fields, commands, and even looping constructs. I believe it is still in use today after 5 years, and no real changes to how it works.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ohhh the good old times when we didn't have to worry about making a living and the hardest thing was to study for a stupid exam at school hehe. I wrote my first functioning code with an Amstrad CPC 664.. way back when... mid 80's. I was all about archiving everything in my life, so now I was able to archive all my collectables and such with that little computer :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had no computer as a kid but took a "Computer Basics" course in 7th grade with the Apple IIe and learned a little basic. Our final had to incorporate the basics of Basic - print something, gosub, goto, etc. While my classmates mostly stacked each required element in as few lines as the could to "get it done", I wrote several thousand lines of Basic to create a Choose your own Adventure program (like those books that were so popular). It even featured a map that allowed you to fly a plane by redrawing the "X" everytime you hit one of 4 keys - each time it checked the coords to see if you were over the destination or out of bounds. I was so proud and my teacher was a bit dumbfounded!</p><p>Since I didn't have any other exposure to computers, I didn't touch programming again for about 20 years. It was like finding a long lost friend. Now it is my living.</p></div>
