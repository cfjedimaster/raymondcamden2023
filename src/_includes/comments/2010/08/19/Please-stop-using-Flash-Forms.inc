		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have never used Flash forms and I get what you're saying and agree with you, Ray --- to a point. The devil's advocate would say that really depends on what your needs are. If someone doesn't know Flex and their needs don't go beyond putting a few simple "flashy" forms on their site (maybe due to a client's request) it's kind of a tall order to ask them to learn the Flex language/framework rather than a few cfform tags.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Craig: Good point. I should clarify.</p><p>1) There are no security issues with Flash Forms that I am aware of.</p><p>2) I do not speak for Adobe in terms of the future availability of Flash Forms. In other words, I'm not saying they will be removed from the product.</p><p>3) They work. To repeat - they work. However - they have limitations that are not present in the "real" version of Flex. I have encountered folks who again and again run into these limitations. Anything outside of a simple form will probably run into trouble. My goal for this post was to help folks _avoid_ the trouble right away. I think Flex is pretty simple to learn. Yes, it will take you more time then just using cfform, but I believe the benefits outweigh the additional time necessary. (And it's a one time "cost" really to learn Flex. You will reap the benefits of adding another language to your arsenal.)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, is anyone still using Flash Forms?  Flash forms were a huge disappointment.  I used them a few times in CF7, and have invested a lot of time rewriting them into Ajax forms.  Anyone who has tried them will know that they just aren't worth the aggravation, at least not unless they upgrade from Flex 1.5.  How long is that even going to be supported anyway.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Neil: Yes. In fact, check out my Contact form. I had to add the warning about Flash Forms a good year or so ago. (My fault really as I blogged about them quite a bit. I wont deny it - I was a user.) I saw another user mention it this morning and that's what spawned this post.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Again, Ray, I agree with the general sentiment in your post. (And like I said, I have never used Flash forms -- or Flex for that matter). In a follow up comment, you say "Anything outside of a simple form will probably run into trouble." But that's just it -- what if all somebody wants is a simple Flash form? If you don't already know Flex (and/or have no interest in learning it), learning Flex to put a simple Flash form on your site is overkill.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Tony . . . can you explain what a simple Flash form would look like?  Two text fields, with validation to check that the input is in a proper format (perhaps 35 characters max, alphanumeric, and also check that the 2nd input is a telephone number), with Submit and Cancel.  In that case, why are we making it a Flash form and not a regular form that has been stylized with CSS to make it look great?</p></div>
