		<div class="comment_text"><p>Question - is it better to code AIR with Flex or with HTML?  Is there that big of a difference?  I'm starting out in AIR and I am far more comfortable using HTML / Javascript than Flex.  Is it worth the time to learn Flex?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I don't think it is fair to say is it better. I'd ask what your goals are. If it is ONLY to build AIR apps, and you know HTML now, then I'd go that route. But remember that Flex can also be used for web sites as well.</p><p>At that point I think it comes down to Flex/Flash versus HTML. Flex can do more - UI wise - and data wise (Flash Remoting is much more efficient than even JSON). HTML can be simpler.</p><p>I'd look at the app you want to build and make the decision then.</p><p>I love both Flex and HTML/Ajaxy stuff. Both allow for some truly powerful apps.</p></div>
