		<div class="comment_text"><p>Can that work with NASA engineers too? i.e. We've only got $10b to get men on Mars by 2020... :-)</p><p>I've switched off Google instant because it's annoying. I don't want results from their suggestions. I want results for what I have already decided I'm searching for. Sometimes autosuggest is useful, but don't search on every suggestion! Why are Google allowing their servers to be hammered for this? (10x increase in search requests?) Do people really find it useful?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thank you, Ray.  I'm working on something that seems impossible and a long shot, and sometimes I feel like giving up. But if I don't try, I'll never know if it could happen or not.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, loving the philosophy. This reminds me of something I heard once (and can in no way confirm that its true) is that the guy who made Dyson vacuum clearners spends the first 15 minutes of every day doing something he knows he will fail at. In this way, he can really get his mind to operate outside of the standard loss-averse fashion that I think we are somewhat hardwired to slip into.</p><p>Every now and then, I think it's crucial to do something impossible - you're always surprised at what you can actually make happen!</p></div>
