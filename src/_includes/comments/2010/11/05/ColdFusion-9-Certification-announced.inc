		<div class="comment_text"><p>Funny should ask that. I've yet to take the test myself. I asked this morning on a private list if anyone has had a chance to. So far one person wrote back and said they thought the test was an improvement over last rev. There didn't' seem to be any weird/incorrect questions.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hmmm. The last time I took it I had seen the questions before hand so it really wasn't fair. ;) I'd just read the docs. I know that sounds obvious, but i would. You can't memorize everything of course, but a good review of the CFML Reference would be a start.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>As promised, coming back with impressions about the CF 9 exam I took today.</p><p>First - I passed - with a score of 86%. Which is good, but I feel like I could do better (for example - I missed one simple question because I failed to remember the attributes of &lt;cfmodule&gt; tag - not so frequent in my code).</p><p>Second - the questions were moderate as difficulty and straightforward; however, I feel like there were too many questions related to &lt;cfscript&gt;. I am sure I failed at least 2 simple questions because I am not using &lt;cfscript&gt;.</p><p>I spent more than 2 months preparing for this exam and I am using CF 9 on a daily basis at work for more than 3 years.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I passed the Coldfusion 9 certification exam with 72% marks. Should have done better, but I did not really get down to preparing for the exam. I had hoped that my experience with working on Coldfusion 9 would help me do pretty well. The exam is not very tough but not easy either. Simply going through the docs wouldn't be of much help, one needs to have some sort of experience of developing apps in CF.</p></div>
