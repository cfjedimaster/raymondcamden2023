And maybe somewhat organized, but mostly that passionate thing.</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroups.adobe.com%2Fpages%2Fstartagroup%3A4WXUz8-NkbENcSeZm6YWYUh_oK0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://groups.adobe.com/pages/startagroup">http://groups.adobe.com/pag...</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>#1: I think most developers think back about what made learning to code well difficult and say, "oh, if only I'd known OOP was the way to go" - but they forget all the lessons that built up to the ability to handle OOP concepts.  I don't think the average nerd can skip Hello World.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I strongly agree with your points on #3 and #7. Even if someone is too new to make serious code suggestions just reading the code is a great way to learn best practices. Paul Irish from the jQuery did a great review of things you can learn from digging through the jQuery source. I know I picked up a few new things from it. I think the ideal, however, is to actively contribute in some form or another.</p><p>Great post. Never thought I'd see one this long re: PHP on your blog :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I write PHP on the side, specifically Drupal. I have to admit that learning Drupal was far removed from anything I had done previously. It's not OOP though. It's simply modular. All you had to do was write module_100DrupalAPICalls ... OOP itself means encapsulation, inheritance.. and knowing what to do with it.</p><p>When I took programming 101, wrapping your mind into function(function(function())) was daunting, let alone overloading and overriding. I started with Java, and CF made sense.</p><p>OOP is one of many ways to accomplish something, and not the only way, take AOP (example: ColdSpring).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm all for learning OOP right off the bat.   Yes, the low level code can be frustrating and hard to grasp.  But I'd rather see someone struggle with that then spend 5 years doing procedural crap and get in the habit of thinking "what code do I need to write" rather than "what are the things I'm working with, what are their attributes and how do they behave?"</p></div>
