		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, where did you learn that you can only do pure AS projects? That is false. You most definitely can use Flex for AIR apps for the Playbook. I've run several demos and it works. Try some of the Adobe samples out. Although if you meant pure AS using the QNX lib (this is the Playbook AIR UI lib) then maybe so. I haven't tried a Flex project with it yet to verify.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>First off - despite what I meant - it was definitely wrong for me to say you can only use AS apps. That is definitely not true - and I'll update the blog entry to make it clear. I believe BB supports 2 other platforms as well.</p><p>What I did mean is that for _AIR_ development you couldn't use a Flex project that made use of mx tags. It had to be pure AS.</p><p>Now as far as I know that is right - but definitely let me know if wrong.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray,<br>I'm pretty sure you're correct about the Actionscript only projects for AIR.  This was mentioned in the getting started video (they make you switch the project name from .mxml to .as).<br>I've begun playing with this over the last couple of days (I have to admit...the free playbook was a very tempting offer :) ) and was really surprised at how simple it was to deploy it to the Playbook via Flash Builder.  I followed along via the video, dropped in the code from the sample at the BB developer site, and was up and running.  Now I'm really looking forward to playing around with the API and seeing what I can get from it.<br>As a side note, Blackberry has done a great job with throwing incentives out to the developer community and trying to promote their new product/platform.  Over at their developer forums, if you become a regular and answer other user's problems and questions, you have the chance to get rewards, conference tickets, etc.  Haven't looked into Blackberry until they started working with AIR and Flex, but very happy with what I've seen so far.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for confirming I wasn't crazy Gareth. So the video mentions the password? I did the HTML one so maybe it wasn't there (but again, I was a poor reader ;).</p><p>And yeah - they are going out of their way to promote this. That's a good thing. I will not deny that I can be bribed to check something out. I'm sure other developers feel the same. It's a cheap trick - but effective. And heck - getting hardware is a big incentive. When you can _see_ the result of your work running on a real thing - it makes a huge difference.</p></div>
