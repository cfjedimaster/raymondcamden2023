Every question I've ever had has been resolved by Googling, and many times it points to something Ray has blogged about.</p><p>@Ray, they did a teeny 0.01 update on CF8 too which also deserved a bigger number due to lots of enhancements.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>9.0.1 - any numeric value returned from a CFC using remote/returnformat=json is a string. If the return values are obtained in the CFC from a query, set to numeric value etc. they are all quoted and sent as strings. Certainly not going to parseInt() everything on the client - so for me 9.0.1 changes to JSON is not an improvement. Guess I'll be backing out of the 9.0.1 update  :-(</p></div>

I just uninstall and install ColdFusion 9 and  9.0.1 and work second time.</p><p>Now I am facing another issue with cfajaxproxy, whenever I tried to call cfc function through cfajaxproxy I got below error.<br>"The ID parameter to the changeassign function is required but was not passed in. ", I understand this error but issue is this was working fine CF 9 and I have double check coding and everything is ok. After little digging into problem I found that coldfusion pass [object object] as url parameter instead of {id:1,assignto:'xyz'} kind of value.</p><p>Sorry Ray for such long comment but just want to share if anyone face same issue.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Chris Long: for what it's worth, I noticed that the installer had disabled the .Net Service on our server. Discovered this after the update was complete (thought it odd). Double-check the .Net service status on your server to see if this could be the issue.</p><p>To everyone else, you can add my name to the growing list of people who can no longer access Administrator after the 9.0.1 update. I've scoured IIS Manager looking for clues, but can't figure it out. Noticed that 9.0.1 updated some of the CFIDE files, so that could be part of the problem. Next step is Adobe support, I guess.  *sigh*</p></div>

After rollback and remove those setting and try again apply CF901, I start see error messages like "The DataSource service is not available" . After all, I had to reinstall CF9 and apply CF901 on fresh copy, it works out well. Also at home have installed CF901 on my DEV CF Vista / 64 bit without any problems.......</p></div>

I could do a javascript</p><p>if (queryrow.nextid)</p><p>This was only true if queryrow.nextid was not 0.</p><p>Too bad that "0" is true in Javascript so all our code would have to be fixed by iterating over the rows again and set those fields that need to be numbers (most of them actually) to an actual number.</p><p>This is just one example where this new behaviour breaks code.</p><p>As there is no easy way to detect this from let's say the first row i would have to work with a list of IDs in a query that i supply back via JSON that contains those fieldnames that need to be numbers as CF now returns only strings.</p><p>Let's say i have a query with 20 fields that i do a SerializeJSON(queryName). There is no way for JS to know what fields should be numbers. I would have to manually supply those fields which really is a pain.

You are technically correct, but how often do you build an AJAX app that works with random data? I've never done that. Your app knows the url it is hitting, it knows the data coming back (you might not like "10" but you know it will be there).</p><p>Again - I'm not saying this shouldn't be changed - I'm mainly arguing about how big of an issue is.</p><p>That being said - I'll blog about your bug report so it gets more exposure then just the comments here.

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian - I'm in the same boat as you with the error, "The tag handler query does not have a setter for the attribute ormOptions specified in the Tag Library Descriptor." My installation failed multiple times as well and then I attempted to manually revert to version 9. I also get a 404 when I try to get to my CF Admin even though the virtual directory exists and has the correct permissions. I'm going to give it another try tonight and see how it goes. I've heard that deleting /web-inf/cfclasses keeps the upgrade from hanging. Hoping for the best tonight!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@John - Check your install log created in the cfusion9 directory. That is where I found that one of my services was preventing the coldfusion install from moving a dll needed.</p><p>First I used the coldfusion web connector app to remove coldfusion from IIS.  Then I stopped all web services, including IIS and coldfusion, I set them to Manual start. Next rebooted the machine,  and then did the cf 9.0.1 install with all of those services stopped.  This time the install was successful.  Reset all the services to "Automatic" start and was good to go from that point on.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian - I gave it a try again last night and the upgrade ran through successfully and the log file did not mention any problems. It overwrote the log from my previous attempts so I'm unable to see what was causing the hang in the installation process the night before.</p><p>Even though the upgrade completely successfully, my installation was unable to run any cf pages after a reboot. I decided to bite the bullet and remove ColdFusion 9 completely followed by a reinstall of 9 and then the upgrade to 9.0.1 After setting up the new installation, everything seems good now. Not a smooth upgrade procedure, but at least it is now in my past. Thanks to all that offered suggestions and help.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray<br>cfgridcolumn removed, but no difference.<br>The code was picked up from an online example and slightly modified.  The grids I am having a problem with are only accessible after a login so I wanted something public facing and above all in it's simplest form so that I could rule out 'external' factors that may be causing the problem!</p><p>As I mentioned, both the test grid and my more complex versions work perfectly well on my 9.0.0.251028 build and used to work on the ISP's server until they upgraded to 9.0.1</p><p>Methinks it's either the upgrade or possibly some file corruption has taken place.  The former will obviously be a universal thing whereas the latter will just be specific to my ISP.  From my googling there appears to be no mention of such a problem so I am beginning to think it's an issue with the ISP's server.  Any thoughts on the matter would be gratefully appreciated in my quest to get to the bottom of the problem.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It looks like the error may be related to the ext-all.js or other javascript files loaded into your page. If you view source, your page is including javascript from the /cfide/scripts area. Then, after the page title, it is including cfgrid.js and ext-all.js from the root directory of your site.  Perhaps there is a conflict between the versions of these files.  I would try removing the reference to cfgrid.js and ext-all.js from your web root and just use the references to the /CFIDE/scripts area.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian<br>Good point.  That's actually left over from an idea I tried out based on the Javascipt errors I noticed.  I thought I would try including those files with the idea if there were errors in the root files they would be overwritten.  I have just removed those includes so we are down to just a call to the grid tags with no extraneous code that could otherwise be thought to be causing the problem.  In other words, cfgrid in its most basic and simplest form which on a good day should work!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Brian<br>Thanks for your suggestion.<br>I have now upgraded my dev server to 9.0.1, concerned not to do it sooner as there appeared to be this problem with the grids.  However relieved to find all is well and I have also since found several 9.0.1 grids on the net.  Now convinced it's an ISP build issue, but not just down to the latest version of ext-all.js perhaps, as reverting this file back to 3.0.0 after the upgrade did not replicate the problem.<br>Don't think anything more can be added to this sub-thread as I suspect it is not a widely experienced problem</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>With regards to the JSON issue, I would just like to add my 2 cents. While I can fix this in the client side, it becomes problematic when the structure is more complex than an array; for example I have a script that creates charts using the js highchart library, and the cf script will return this as part of it's response:</p><p>"series":[<br>	{<br>		"name":"Units",<br>		"lineWidth":"4",<br>		"marker":<br>		{<br>			"radius":"4"<br>		}</p><p>Now what I want to do is pass the unserialized "series" object straight into my js, but I can't because of those string-ified ints. While I can parseInt them, I have to check for every possible numeric parameter.</p><p>For those still struggling, this can be fixed by using JSONUtil:<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjsonutil.riaforge.org%2F%3ARbZp_l6PlCtV_GlquUs-3O0DvYw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://jsonutil.riaforge.org/">http://jsonutil.riaforge.org/</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>We're trying to use some native tags in CF 9 such as CFGRID, and cfinput type="datefield", but we're having issues. We had no problems whatsoever with the development machines locally and an the remote development server. But we put it into production and we're getting JavaScript errors. So I used Firebug to track down the error. The error I get on the far right of Firebug's script window is saying that it's having a problem with CFAJAX and CFCALENDAR (first error) or ext-all.js on the CFGRID. Both of these are in the CFIDE folder. Anyone know of a reason this error might be happening? Or a way to figure out a solution? Any help would be appreciated.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@JeffL I tried that and got the same results.  I have determined through trial and error that there's something going on with the load balancer.  The reason I have come to that conclusion is that if I hard code the server name, it works but if I just use the URL and it goes through the load balancer it works 1/4 of the time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I see this thread is pretty dead, but I have just updated cf9.0.1 with hotfix4 and java 7.  My cfgrids only show page 1 of 1 no matter what I do.  No errors (javascript or cf).  Correction, getDataSource had to be changed to getStore in a grid renderer I had done quite a while back.  Any thoughts?</p></div>
