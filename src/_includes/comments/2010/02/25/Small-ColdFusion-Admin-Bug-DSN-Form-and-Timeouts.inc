I thought it might have been because I was logged into all 3 instances we have running on that box from the same browser (though with different tabs).  I dismissed it thinking my sessions got confused or some such.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Wow, that's crazy.  I literally saw this today... but in CF 8, logged into a cluster.  Strangely, I had just logged into CF Admin, went straight to the DSN and presto, DSN?target=true.  No chance for a session timeout, I guess.  Like you I *almost* hit the submit, but was quicker with the back button on the mouse.  One more click on the DSN again and all was well.  Weirdness.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I run into this a lot when I'm working with CF Admin in tabs for multiple sites at once (using the same IP and different ports, since we only allow maintenance via localhost).</p></div>
