		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I've finally started to embrace ColdFusion Builder :) When I switched to Mac, I also went builder. Looking forward to playing around with the extension stuff more. Cool stuff.</p><p>On a related note to this, FireBug now has HTML/JSON tabs in their AJAX request monitoring such that if you get a response that is seen as AJAX or HTML, they will give you a tab to see raw data rendered as something. That's been suuuuper helpful for debugging ColdFusion errors that come back in my AJAX :D</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>That's nice Ben - but all the cool kids are on Chrome now. You got to catch up. :P Seriously though - that sounds useful. Chrome has nice dev tools that mostly mimic Firebug, but it's not quite as polished.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ray, I've definitely started to use Chrome for a lot of stuff; it's fast and seems to be much better about memory usage (plus, I love how easily I can drag tabs around)... buuuuut, FireFox was my first love and it's hard to give up :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>What cinched it for me was watching how long it took Firefox to start up. I don't think it was that much slower _after_ but the initial launch was slow as crap.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, it truly is a fast app. There's also a few sites (ex. Flickr, ING Direct) that I simply won't use on FireFox as they just kill the browser.</p></div>
