		<div class="comment_text"><p>I like the use of headers for status info, I hadn't thought to try that before.</p><p>As far as content that is returned I've found that sending back a login form and message to show on the page is kind of nice. That way people can login and refresh the page (or that section of the page) and pick up right where they left off.</p></div>
