		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am about to utilize Galleon on a project, but it will require that all posts be held "in escrow" and not appear live until approved by an administrator. If I find an easy, compact way of doing that I will share with you what I did for what value it may have. On the other hand, if you are right on the brink of adding this capability yourself, and your code is almost baked...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@James: Nope, no plans for it. I know you've mentioned it to me before. I can definitely see a need for it. Galleon definitely has easy ways to edit messages and set up users to be moderators, but it is always _post_ publication.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am about to launch Galleon for a K-8 school. For a number of years, the school created a paper newsletter to share information with parents that was distributed via backpack express. A few years ago, a "blog" replaced the newsletter, and it was quasi-transformed into more a of a message board/forum anyway, so migrating to a product like Galleon seemed a natural fit. As for localization ... we may not have a direct need for such a feature, but ... we do have some parents whose native language is not english, they may find it helpful.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Using it as a FAQ / Help Forum for our platforms.  Localization might be nice, but if a customer was responding in a different language, I can only respond in English so its not of major benefit to me.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I used Galleon to build a document review and comment system for a government agency. It was a big time saver. They have talked about upgrading some of the code i added so they can use the system for other departments, but I have not heard anything back. For me, localization would not be good, but I can see it being helpful if Galleon is being downloaded by people from other countries.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Recently had to throw together a forum of sort for a hobby site. Content posted on the site is in several languages; e.g Russian, Polish and some Japanese.</p><p>Running a base install of Galleon was pretty quick till I run into a problem of Question Marks(?????????) for the data being inputted by forums visitors.</p><p>The site runs on MySQL and the Solution was to Drop a DB(Not a biggie),  Recreate it with Default CHARSet of UTF8, replace CHARSET=latin1 with CHARSET=UTF8 in DB Creation Script(run the script) and add a connection string for the CF Data Source(CFAdmin) as in: jdbc:mysql://SERVERNAME:3306/DBNAME?characterEncoding=UTF8&amp;characterSetResults=UTF8</p><p>Alex</p></div>
