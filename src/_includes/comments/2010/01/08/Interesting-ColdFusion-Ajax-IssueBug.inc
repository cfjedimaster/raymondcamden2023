		<div class="comment_text"><p>For what it's worth I have abandoned cfdiv in favor of using the div/load combo setup with jQuery.  In limited testing, using jQuery's load is way faster and in my opinion, cleaner than my old fav (navigate).</p><p>I'm working on a blog post that combines a fairly complex shipping app that uses a multi-pannel layout (using nested cflayout tags) but changes and updates content using jQuery load rather than navigate.  The difference in speed and code simplicity with the jQuery version is notable.  All of my CF apps pretty much make use of cfgrid, cfajaxproxy and a couple of other nice to have CF AJAX features - the rest is all jQuery.</p><p>After working with CF's AJAX framework for the last two years I was initially very biased towards doing anything that was not contained within the application server out of the box.  However, I'm come to believe that jQuery is different - it's well documented and maintained and it doesn't seem to be losing steam or getting stale like lots of other AJAX frameworks that have already bit the dust.  (EXT is pretty cool to but certain things are made harder than they need to be)</p><p>Why did I resist jQuery for so long?  Perhaps I'm dumber than I had originally thought!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Andy - My guess would be that if there is a built-in event handler (which there almost has to be, how else would the results of navigate() be populated into a div?), it would get called prior to any custom callbacks, etc.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I know this is an old post but I wanted to throw in my thoughts.  I'm really new to jQ so I may be way off.</p><p>In my experience here is what is going on with the ColdFusion.navigate.  When using ColdFusion.navigate to load the contents into the container, the DOM is already ready.  Thus the  $(document).ready() in test2a.cfm will fire immediately as the script is loaded into the container.  $("#content") will not exist at that point therefore failing to add the listener to the element.  This also explains why changing to live fixes it.  Live "monitors" the DOM for changes then adds the listener once it is there.</p><p>The solution I have used is the ajaxonload().  Use a regular named function in place of $(document).ready() and then put a &lt;cfset AjaxOnLoad(functionName)&gt;.  I have also used &lt;cfset AjaxOnLoad(function(){foo(1,2,3);bar(4,5,6);})&gt; when I wanted to include parameters with the ajaxonload or do more than one thing.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am experiencing an issue with cfdiv that seems to be related to this issue. I am trying to get tablesorter (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftablesorter.com%2Fdocs%2F%29%3Aw-qwB1FPAaPevClQTiAUuhpSaZw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tablesorter.com/docs/)">http://tablesorter.com/docs/)</a> to work within a cfdiv. I can get it to work when not in cfdiv. I can get jQuery to alert though, so jQuery is working. I think this is related to the (document).ready or onajaxload. Any help would be much appreciated.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Easiest recommendation is to stop using cfdiv. If you are already using jQuery, you don't need it. To mimic cfdiv's "load a url into this div", you can simply do this in jQuery:</p><p>$("#someid for a div").get("theurl.cfm", {}, function(res) {<br>//optional call back handler;<br>});</p></div>
	</div>
