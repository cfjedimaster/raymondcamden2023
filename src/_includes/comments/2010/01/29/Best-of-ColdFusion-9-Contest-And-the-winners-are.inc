		<div class="comment_text"><p>Oh - wow -</p><p>...[uncoordinated skip around for a few moments]...</p><p>Thanks so much to Charlie for reviewing my application, Ray for hosting the contest, and all the other judges for your involvement in this. I must thank Adobe as well for such generous prizes.</p><p>Everyone who has submitted an application to this contest - I have learned so much from taking a look at your submissions. They were fun to play around with too. Thank you.</p><p>I'm in the middle of a move right now, but once I get my environment all set back up I will be making changes to MuralBuilder / <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2FMuralBuilder.com%3Au4T2QIBX2pnmwMx50s_dJeP59zA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="MuralBuilder.com">MuralBuilder.com</a> with the suggestions many of you have had. I also have quite a few more ideas from working in the web industry but just now being able to develop them on my own :). This will be an interesting year.</p><p>The CF Community has been an unexpected but amazing addition to the choice to to learn ColdFusion. As I become more confident in my knowledge I will be sure to give to others the assistance and advice you have given to me. Thanks again to everyone. I know I've said that several times now, but really, thank you.</p><p>~ Ben</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Can't argue with these results, Ray -- MuralBuilder was pretty cool!  Congratuations to Ben, Marko, Sam and the rest for all of the great entries.</p><p>I am honored to have received runner-up status with CFDungeon... ColdFusion 9 is awesome, and with a little passion for development, CF9 makes anything possible, even a text parser adventure game straight out of the '80s!  ;)</p></div>
