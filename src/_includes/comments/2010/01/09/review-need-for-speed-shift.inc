		<div class="comment_text"><p>I have NFS Shift for PC.  I feel like it is pretty decent but not great.  I would probably think it were much better if I didn't have Grid to compare it to.  I think Grid on PC just blows NFS Shift out of the water in all categories (and is less $ because it has been out for a while).  <br>Car damage in Grid is far more interesting than NFS, they make it look so more 'real'.  <br>Graphics are pretty even between these two games but the hardware requirements for Grid are a lot less on the PC.  Grid deals with the 'screw up on the last lap' problem by giving you a flashback feature that lets you rewind in time about 10 seconds to correct your driving snafu that put you hard into the wall.</p><p>I've also been thinking about giving Dirt 2 a try.  It is produced by the same group (CodeMasters) and it looks like all the things I love about Grid 'cept on dirt.  So many games, so little time!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having played almost every racing game, sim or otherwise, since the Pole Position days, I feel that NFS: Shift is a decent addition, with ProStreet being a low point.  I really enjoyed High Stakes and the ricer themed variants too.</p><p>Ray - Do you plan on picking up Gran Turismo 5 when it drops?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It's going to be a juggernaut of a game as they've picked up NASCAR and IRL, though that isn't the major focus.  GT3 on, tuning has become part and parcel with winning the top tier races.  I have a cursory knowledge of the physics of it, though not an inkling of the patience required to iteratively tune a car to its potential.  If you end up picking up a copy, pop over to <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gtvault.com%3A_eLDorAHEeWIzZuwJrNI5FNzzog&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gtvault.com">http://www.gtvault.com</a>  It's a tuning website I put together a long time ago, and it really helps for the people that just want to race rather than tune all day long.</p></div>
