		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hey - thank you so much Charlie for your time put into this review!</p><p>I was wondering if the application might not be good enough to be reviewed - so I am stoked to see this review and such positive comments. Thanks to you all.</p><p>I have seen expandpath() in example code before but had not yet taken the time to explore that function. Now I know :)</p><p>I set up the application variables in the onrequest start method because it is how they were set up in various <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Flynda.com%3ANvMx_u-uucOajnsYQnV69PMl0MI&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="lynda.com">lynda.com</a> tutorials. It is good to now know a more "proper" way to do that.</p><p>Good points about privacy issues, Charlie. I included a basic minimally edited outline, but did not specify anything about the images. I will do that.</p><p>Anything over an image of a few MB starts to create issues with memory space and creates java heap size errors. That is why I have the 12MB limit as of now. In my hosting environment I don't have control of that, but yes it would be very nice for local versions.</p><p>@Patrick - <br>Charlie had issues with that when he was testing it as well. I could never get the onComplete method of uploadify to work (server settings?) I don't know, but eventually I had to make my own way. I modified the uploadify javascript to comment out the following lines<br>---     <br>// jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).attr('id') + ID + " .percentage").text(' - Completed');<br>     // jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).attr('id') + ID).fadeOut(250, function() { jQuery(this).remove()});<br>---<br>And then monitor the progress percentage with jquery to continue when it reaches 100%. This might be what you are having issues with? It seems to perform differently in different server environments, though I do not know that is the cause for sure. I still haven't really figured it out.</p><p>I need to give credit to Ben Nadel - It is documented in the component, but I will say it here as well - I am using one of his components to generate random strings. <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bennadel.com%2Findex.cfm%3Fdax%3Dblog%3A488.view%3AMtL-vXb3hj_2XsAkzq3lbgnYsZE&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:488.view">http://www.bennadel.com/ind...</a></p><p>Going back now to edit the application it does feel a little bit like spaghetti to me so I am currently working on learning CFWheels.</p><p>Thanks again to all of you. It was a great pleasure to see this contest when I was starting out with development. It gave me something to work on out of the gate. The ColdFusion blogs that many of you maintain have been an awesome resource.</p><p>Ok, my book post is done :).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Patrick<br>I hadn't performed any of that - very helpful!. Thank you. I'll give it a try. This will be very helpful in future uses of of the uploadify plugin.</p><p>In this specific case, since onComplete doesn't register, I used it as a pseudo feature instead. Since the upload bar does not fade away on a completed upload which is the normal documented behavior, I instead opted to change the bar to green to clearly signal a completed upload. If it actually did work I think my finished UI would have been different. Interesting how things like that happen :)</p><p>@PB<br>I'll leave Ray or someone else to answer this for sure since I hadn't used expandpath before, but that looks true to me. application.uploadroot is setting itself as itself before being defined.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Ben R: again great job, and I'm surprised to hear you had doubts. It's awesome, and I'm glad to see others say so.</p><p>@Ben R and Patrick: As for the problem with it not running for Patrick, yeah, as Ben noted I had problems with his first version, but he fixed that, and I happened to have gotten a new computer by the time I tested his second version, and it worked there. If there's an ongoing issue, perhaps it can be sorted out here as current or future readers check it out.</p><p>@PB: About that mistake in the suggested change for use of expandpath, yep, my bad. I was focused more on pointing out the opp to change to using expandpath, and though I thought I had tested it out before writing it, somehow I was mistaken.</p><p>Some may also note that I could (and should) have thought to remove the quotes and pounds in the setting of wwwroot, when I removed his static value. Doh! :-) I did get that right it in the second cfset, of course.</p><p>So it could be:</p><p>cfset application.wwwroot=expandpath(".")</p><p>cfset application.uploadroot=application.wwwroot&amp;"\murals"</p><p>Now, some might reasonably prefer to have written that second assignment to go ahead and USE the quotes and pounds  (and not use the ampersand), as in:</p><p>cfset application.uploadroot="#application.wwwroot#\murals"</p><p>That's just stylistic differences. But thanks for catching my mistake in the second assignment.</p><p>Looking forward to seeing how the actual contest voting goes. Great idea and great effort, Ray, contestants, and reviewers.</p></div>
