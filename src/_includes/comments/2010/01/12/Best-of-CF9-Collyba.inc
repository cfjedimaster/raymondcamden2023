		<div class="comment_text"><p>First of all thank you Francisco and Ray for taking a time to review my code.</p><p>1. Application.cfc scoping. Honestly, since application.CFM got its CFC equivalent, I see it the same way way I see all other components. Of course, it is not, but still...<br>At the same time, I agree that we should use things what they are made for. Thinking of it, this is more inherited habit from latest client then expression of my attitude :)</p><p>2.  CF9 as a whole, at the time I was working on this app was completely new to me. So, ORM was too. I am still digesting its basics (mostly via blogs and mailing list), therefore things like db seeding was too advance atm ;) Anyway, thank you for pointing to that feature.</p><p>Regarding licensing. I told you Ray that I suck with it. I never bothered with that in my life. So, if its content made you and anyone uncomfortable just for a second, I apologize. What so ever, I think I'll publish it as open source project, as soon as I finish basic feature set.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Marko, I loved to finally see a AJAX-bridge demo for messaging.</p><p>I have a few questions:<br>1) why not create the custom endpoint the same way you create the dynamic destinations?<br>2) Any reason to create dynamic destinations instead of using subtopics?<br>3) Why not use setRemoteCredentials for authentication?</p><p>Once again, great job!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>@Sam <br>Thank you</p><p>@Joao <br>First of all thank you for your blogs at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onflexwithcf.org%3AtD0SGXdvNI_b1mG3zKZCF3pRZ5k&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.onflexwithcf.org">www.onflexwithcf.org</a>. In install.txt I promised I'll list everyone who helped me working on this, and sure you'll be on it.</p><p>1) At the time I was developing, BlazeDS, and messaging in general, was completely new to me. So, I get to idea of dynamic destinations when time was running out and had no time to develop that idea further...which includes custom endpoints.</p><p>2) I saved subtopic for private channels. Destination per client, subtopics per user.</p><p>3) See 1. Now, when you mentioned it, I'll read about it, and how it could fit in my solution.</p><p>Overall, I set myself fairly (if not too) high peaks to climb, in a relatively short period of time (3 weeks). Idea was too learn as much as possible on this project, and trust me, my brain want to blow in critical moments :)</p><p>Of course, any advice, hint or tip is welcome.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Glad you like it, Mike!</p><p>While working on this, I was under strong impression that BlazeDS and LCDS are threated as a "privilege" of Flex developers. To be even more strange, BlazeDS is now coming preinstalled with ColdFusion 9, and I discovered it accidentally. As such it is a new feature compared to previous one, still I didn't see it anywhere listed.</p><p>Therefore, I don't wonder why Mike wasn't aware of its existence.</p><p>No matter what, I am quite sure it may play very interesting/important role in development of interactive CF/non-Flex applications.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ah, sorry to hear you still have a problem. I used exactly the same setup.For several times, I had a problem with db, but only on app init when CF was (re)creating db structure (DDL, based on persistent CFCs). However, single page refresh/reload was solving the thing.<br>On different mailing lists and blogs many devs are complaining on Derby DB. So, that may cause the problem to you too. Only reason why I used Derby is that it comes bundled with CF9. Honestly, I'll replace it with MySQL or PostgreSQL asap :)</p><p>Thinking of it. If you have installed any other db server on your machine,  you can go with it. Just replace (or even totally remove) "dialect" value with correct one in ormsettings in application.cfc and you are good to go.<br>Checked the code and I called db directly only once, and that query is pretty much sql-92 compatible.</p></div>
