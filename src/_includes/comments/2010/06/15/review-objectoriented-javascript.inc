		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am also enjoying this book but have no problems with the title. It does include chapters on Objects, Prototype, Inheritance and Design Patterns so that's four by my count. I have little JavaScript experience but have had more than a few adventures with ActionScript and found the level about right. The exercises are great and the style is commendably concise.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Thanks for the review Ray. I too like you have had lots of self teaching and even some book reading of JavaScript, but no real formal training or reading of books that focus on OO approaches for JavaScript. I'm sure that I will pick up this book.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>My background with JavaScript is similar to yours - I dreaded using it until jQuery came along and made it fun and dealt to the cross-browser issues. I picked up this book about a month ago and have really enjoyed it - still re-read parts.  Highly recommended!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm glad I read your review! You are right in saying that the title is "misleading" - well, it misled me to think that it was too advanced! I had read Jeremy Keith's DOM Scripting and Bulletproof Ajax and was looking for a good "wholesome" js book to bring me to the next level. Will this book fulfill that need?</p></div>
