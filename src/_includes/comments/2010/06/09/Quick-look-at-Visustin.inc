		<div class="comment_text"><p>I looked at this too. The cost both seems reasonable and high. I ran this against some old 1000+ line procedural CF and was kinda a mixed bag.</p><p>Possibly with more time with it, could see it being useful when wanting to refactor old code. Would love to hear from some CF developers who use it.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am not sure I could come up with a great use-case for this; but, it's cool to see code in a different format. I suppose if you look at other people's code, this is a nice visual way to get comfortable with the abstract workflow before you dive in.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It looks quite interesting. I went to the site and it claims that it not only handles flowcharts, but UML. If so (and I'll be checking it out real soon), it could be quite useful in development.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This would be a good view to have inside of cfbuilder maybe like some other folks said especially if your debuggung other peoples code (or even your own old code!)</p></div>
