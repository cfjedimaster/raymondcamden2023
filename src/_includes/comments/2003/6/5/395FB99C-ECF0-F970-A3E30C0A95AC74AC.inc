		<div class="comment_text"><p>Do you know if/how we can apply any updates with fixes for Homesite to CF5 Studio? There was an update recently that included things like the search function losing its place after corrections are made, and such. (Homesite 5.1 update?)</p><p>Any ideas on getting those or any other fixes into CF5 Studio?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I meant a very recent update that I saw for Homesite while many of the same issues remain in cf5.</p><p>I find the MM site completely unusable now. Can''t even search for custom tags anymore. Are they that brainless? No right click, no back button, slow... Absolutely painful to use. Hopefully they don''t take CF down by associating it too closely with flash over time.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Stylo, i agree on this one, i quit searching in their tags exchange lib. wait - wait - wait, and no accessibility at all. At least they comfort me not using flash as navigation system in a site, good ol'' html is always our savior...</p><p>K</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Sorry, but I think this never ending story about CFS/HS/HS+ is ridicolous. These tools have no future. It''s really clear.<br>Rumor, rumor always rumor .....but a clear, honest, official and definitive<br>message from Macromedia has not arrived yet. All Macromedia marketing never say a word about CFS/HS/HS+. Articles, extensions, improvements, marketing etc are all for DW. They say it''s a better tool. If DW is the best, why MM have to continue to develop and to sell CFS/HS?<br>I'' m an old and faithful CF and HS user. I continue to use them also if I''m a<br>ColdFusion developer and MM wants I switch to DW, but honestly I can''t suggest to the company where I work to buy more licenses. It''s better that the new devlopers starts with a new editor, an editor with a future.<br>From MM web site a new customer will never know of CFS/HS existence! It''s a normal behaviour for a company that wants to continue to sell their software? I don''t think so. I should have prefer that MM say that they can''t continue to support these tools for some reasons and that they will not be improved...like KAWA and others software.<br>R.I.P CFS/HS</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nobody seems to care...but there is no Homesite+ for the Mac. But then again, there never was Homesite or CF Studio for the Mac anyway. (I care because I''m a PC user who got a new job where everything is Mac...)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I saw this thread show up when I was searching for CF Studio 5. I STILL use CF Studio 5 for hand-coding all my websites, and I've never really liked any of its replacements.</p><p>I'm in the midst of switching computers now, and have misplaced all my old developer software, including CF Studio 5 ... any chance you know of someone with a copy I could get?</p><p>I will use other alternatives if I have to, but this software was just really nice to work with.</p></div>
