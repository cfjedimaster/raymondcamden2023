		<div class="comment_text"><p>I find myself reading your blog a lot today... Anyhow, it sounds to me like what you want to do is basically have an ongoing "chat" with a few select participants, with the transcript of that chat posted where others can read it, but not participate.  Is that it?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, I had the same idea. The best thing that I could think of would be a RIA discussion app.</p><p>One could click on a link to view discussions which would open a small ria app that lists all topics collapsed. Upon clicking on the collapsed topic it would list a collapsed list of replies, etc, etc.</p><p>If designed well, I think it would be a very easy and cool addition to a blog. Eventually I will have the time to create it, but if someone beats me to it, all the better.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Bryan,</p><p>This sounds kinda like what I was talking about - although your RIA idea is more elegant.  Basically, it''s like private chat that non-participants can view.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yeah, sort-of, I really wasn''t thinking of a chat app. Although that is a good option also. It would actually be a discussion forum but a simple one that can only be viewed.</p><p>If it was a discussion type app it would allow the user to easily sort through the past information. Instead of joining in on reading in the middle of a chat.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>This is the perfect distinction between "what is a blog" and "what is a forum".  Ray, I think you are 100% on target with "comments are really secondary" in a blog.  The focus is the author''s opinion.</p><p>I think the best way to handle a discussion in a blog is to link to it..."hey we are having a cool discussion on...you can read it here" with a link to it.  Though since your discussion is happening on a ListServ...that doesn''t really work. Linking to a page...or even just making the long blog entry as you mentioned - while sort of hinky - is a good solution for THIS particular issue.  If a discussion is needed - then use a forum.  You could have your own forum linked to your blog.</p><p>Bottom line is that when I am reading blogs...I am just reading - and occasionally throwing out a comment.  I personally don''t like to see "Comments(54)" at the bottom of a blog entry.  And that is my 5 cents.</p></div>
