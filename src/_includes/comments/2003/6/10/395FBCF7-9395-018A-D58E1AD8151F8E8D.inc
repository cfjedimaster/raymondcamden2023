		<div class="comment_text"><p>One of my all-time favorites as well.  For some reason, I always seem to find myself watching the reruns when they make it onto tv.  Looking forward to the new edition!</p><p>As fot the Nazi parallels, there is a lot in the movie/show - mass brainwashing, a charismatic leader, scientific experiments on human subjects, the propaganda, a resistance movement (even the V for victory is a WW2 throwback).  Scientists and critics are silenced, etc...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I get all that - I guess I just considered that ''normal Evil'', and not Nazi evil. Typically when I think of the Nazis, I think of their views on race, and that wasn''t evident in the show. Again, I''m thinking WAY too much about this.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think the show was less about showing the "evil" of Nazi Germany, and more generally just about recasting the rise of the Nazi party in a more modern setting.</p><p>Now that I seem to be commenting on your blog all the time, what do you think about setting a cookie to remember people''s name/email address for future postings?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The Nazi parallels Rob spoke of are analagous to what the Nazi''s did to other countries in Europe and to its own people. Not really to what they did to the Jews or Gypsies.</p><p>ANnd while Faye Grant was OK Jane Badler was hot as shit as Diana.</p><p>Whew.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea, I guess I''m seeing the parallels a bit more now. And yes, Diana was hot... well, more because she was so evil. ;)</p><p>Rob - I do plan on adding "remember me" sometime soon.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Look at the Nazi''s in Holland and the Netherlands.  They made camps for the jews that looked like Chattels and resorts!  They where still camps and you could not leave but at first many of them where better or nicer places at least materially than where the jews who where put in them than their previous domiclies.  The Nazi''s tried to convince the Jews that they where actually going to help them and that the camps where for their protection.  All these camps also only let highly educated and skilled Jews live there and they where made to do skilled labour and work (like designing air craft etc).</p><p>Latter as the war progressed the occupants learned the terrible truth.</p></div>
