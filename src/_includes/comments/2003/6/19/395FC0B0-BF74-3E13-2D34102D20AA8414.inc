		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray:</p><p>It was a pleasure to talk to you at CFUN-03, and I enjoyed your presentation on CFCs.  I look forward to your blog code updates, and, as promised, I will convert your SQL Server script to MySQL when you make your next update (and possibly to other data types, at some point).  I also have a few ideas on how to make the code a little more configurable, so that it can be easier to install, use and customize for the CFMX novice, if you are interested.  I will be using the code on the WVMUG/WVCFUG site (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wvmug.org%3A4_9CqeBzNab7OqeZX61h126Z7vw&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.wvmug.org">http://www.wvmug.org</a> - which is just in the early stages of being developed), as well as on my own site, <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brianmeloche.com%3ACYwdwl6KgWhSCFnUrWuUm8HfweQ&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.brianmeloche.com">http://www.brianmeloche.com</a>.  Talk to you soon!</p></div>
