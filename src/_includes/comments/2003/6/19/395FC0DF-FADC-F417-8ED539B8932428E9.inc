		<div class="comment_text"><p>I some times listen to Soma FM or the radio show over at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glo.uk.com%3AxQeMVQajUf2hpK7B5zGbdODvEpU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.glo.uk.com">http://www.glo.uk.com</a>.  But I listen to the normal radio all the time when I drive.  I usally listen to news/talk programs as well as I listen to the radio on the internet.</p><p>One thing to note... your premious does not hold up to stats which are that Radio is more popular than ever with Clearchannel getting 110 million listerns a week!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Robi, I didn''t say radio was less popular, just that I don''t get why anyone would listen to it. Talk radio is a bit different, that I could stomach in the car - but music stations? No way. If I spent more time in the car I''d get one of those satellite systems.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>A couple comments. As a former part-time internet dj, it''s been sad to see the demise of over 90% of the web stations in the U.S., due to the Library of Congress and RIAA fiasco. I wish they could rework the royalty amount, so that we could have more freedom of choice. As it is, companies like ClearChannel have won the battle to keep Web competition off the ''air'' by bankrupting their owners. And is it any wonder that they have a huge number of listeners, when they gobble up more stations across the country seemingly every week? Even so, I would bet that the total listenership across all radio has declined dramatically in the last ten years. No wonder; it does suck, and both the web and XM offer better alternatives.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond, somaFM is really a very nice radio. I miss it so much when they are closed due to a RIAA action last year. If you use it regularly will be nice to donate a small amount to then - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.somafm.com%2Fsupport%2F%3AIhcVeWtHevUHO7qexJB348Pa3gc&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.somafm.com/support/">http://www.somafm.com/support/</a>.</p><p>Is worth to point an EXCELLENT software called RipCast - <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xoteck.com%2Fripcast%2F%3AGufwNQ-PX1D5VOZBl5o4z-gZVqo&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.xoteck.com/ripcast/">http://www.xoteck.com/ripcast/</a>. RipCast basically is a streaming recorder and runs integrated with winamp and any internet radio based on the SHOUTcast software (it support others too). Take a look, is very worthy for real.</p><p>Regards!<br>Alex HÃ¼bner</p></div>
