		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Camden,</p><p>have a question for you. I have recently migrated from CF5 to MX and Spectra 1.5.2. My CF 5 application uses Site Minder (Advanced Secuirty) to connect to an LDAP Server.</p><p>I have four security contexts and 4 user directories. So access to the site is restricted and only users having proper permissions can login to the site.</p><p>Now then, when it came to migrating to MX and Spectra, I first updated to Spectra 1.5.2 on CF5 from Spectra 1.5.1. Tested the site, and it all worked without any errors.</p><p>Updated to MX on IIS. Ran the webtop, the spectra configuration wizard opened up, was prompted to enter the User Directory username and password for the 4 user directories. Clicked on next and then completed the process, could login to the webtop, all worked fine.</p><p>Later on I realised that I entered a wrong password for one of the user directories. When I tried login in to the site with a username under that user directory, it failed. What I now want to know is if it is possible in CFMX to edit the user directory details?</p><p>I''ll appreciate your help.</p><p>Best Regards,<br>Allan</p></div>
