		<div class="comment_text"><p>Unbelievably, I just ran into the same thing today.  Difference was I needed to add php4 to the color coding.  It took a second to figure that one out.  So, doing what worked, and avoiding the question, Why are the file extensions managed in two places anyway?</p></div>
