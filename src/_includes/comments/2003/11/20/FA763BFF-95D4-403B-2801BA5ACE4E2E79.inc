		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray's session was great.  He delivered a unique presentation that covered topics that are important to me.  I feel this presentation gave me some good ideas and fundamentals that I will now be able to expand on and implement in my programming.</p><p>I must say I have really enjoyed attending presentations given by the "masters" whom I have watched over the years in mailing lists and newsgroups.</p><p>Thanks Ray.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>ray it was good, the presentation, that is.  dont worry about that!  the cfc geeks of a feather was great as well.  we had probably, as you said, the most productive meeting of the whole conference.  too bad some macromedians werent there that could have taken the input that was given there and applied it to blackstone!!!</p></div>
