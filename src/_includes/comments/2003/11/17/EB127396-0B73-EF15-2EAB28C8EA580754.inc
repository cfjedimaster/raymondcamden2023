		<div class="comment_text"><p>So, I made it, but let me tell you what happenned. I arrived at the airport on time to find the skies not so bad. But then, of course, the flight was cancelled due to mechanical reasons. Then I almost missed my (new) connecting flight to SLC.</p><p>I guess I should just be happy I made it. Ben Forta had a MUCH worse experience.</p></div>
