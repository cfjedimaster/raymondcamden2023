		<div class="comment_text"><p>I understand, but Wednesday night was the best night available. There has been a _very_ large interest in a CFC BOF. Unfortunately, Macromedia did not chose to open up the BOF process as it (well, as it and ALLR) did in previous years. All I wanted (and quite a few other people) was a place to talk CFC development in a non-session format, ie, more open.</p><p>I certainly do not want to draw people away from official events, that is why I chose a time at night, and a time away from the big parties and such.</p><p>To be fair, I'll be sure to warn people about the CFMX Engineeers BOF at 6:30. Hey, if you want, you  guys can always come over and join us? ;)</p></div>
