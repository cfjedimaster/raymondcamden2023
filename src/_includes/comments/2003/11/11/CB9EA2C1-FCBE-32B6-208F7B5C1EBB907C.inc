		<div class="comment_text"><p>Probably more info then you wanted to know, but yes, the car was fixed. But get this - my wife picks the car up (I was out of town). I arrive home two days later. Get in the car. We drive. We arrive. I open the door... I open the door... wait, what the hell is wrong?!?! The passenger side door opened from the outside, but not the inside. Then we find that the right side panel door doesn't respond to the button push. So, we had asked them to fix the doors, and all they did was cosmetic work.</p><p>The passenger door is STILL a bit... stiff. I had noticed that when I picked it up the second time, and they told me it would settle in time, but it hasnt.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You probably already know this, but this problem can easily be fixed. Just copy the exception_en.xml in folder CFusionMX\wwwroot\WEB-INF\exception and rename it to excepion_LOCALE.xml. Now the errors appear in english.</p><p>However I do agree this is an annoying problem, and macromedia should be able to fix this very easily, and should have done so a long time ago.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>The "known issues" list is remarkably short for a complex product like RedSky. I was one of the happy beta testers so kudos to the other for helping MM release a product with probably fewer issues than any previous release of ColdFusion - despite it being the most powerful version yet.</p><p>Interesting to see what the MM gurus have up their sleeve to CF 7 :)</p></div>
