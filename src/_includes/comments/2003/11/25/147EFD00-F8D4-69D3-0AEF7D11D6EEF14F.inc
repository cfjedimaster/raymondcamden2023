		<div class="comment_text"><p>Actually, you can get a replacement battery for far less than the 255.  You also can now get AppleCare on the iPods, although I am not certain that would cover the battery.  Finally, I have owned three iPods now, and the person who I sold my first one too, who works with me, reports no issue with the battery after over 24 months.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>An actual battery replacement for an out of warranty unit through Apple, according to Apple's Web site(<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.info.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fapplecare_products%2Fservice%2Fipod_service.html%29%3AW4xKjZ_vy0_MZqKuyu9oVZrWrW0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.info.apple.com/support/applecare_products/service/ipod_service.html)">http://www.info.apple.com/s...</a> is 99 dollars.</p><p>I believe, but could be wrong, that in-warranty units would have their battery replaced at no-charge, so going through a third pary wouldd be unnecessary in that case.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Raymond, you took something passed around on the net at face value...!?!?  ;-)</p><p>It's definitely possible to reduce charging life down to the 18-month range... the Apple support site lists a number of ways to break this. Absent things like heat extremes, some have also spontaneously shown 18-month chargeability, and this has been addressed by a software update. Apple's site lists replacement at $99, and with a quick web search you can find third-party kits for even less.</p><p>People who put their messages onto buildings are usually wrong... I live in San Francisco, I know this.... ;-)</p><p>(I've got a 30G, and it's great, but I envy you going to a 60... I'm looking at all these CDs I can't add to my rotation yet. If you use it mainly in a car then that form-factor shouldn't matter as much as if using it while walking. I was surprised by how different the experience was from using CDs... really enjoy it.)</p><p>jd</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, for now, yea. XM Radio would be nice _along_ with the mp3 player, but it all comes down to me adding another bill every month. ;) I spend a lot more time in front of a machine than I do a car, and the mp3 player would be good on the road as well. If I _do_ purchase a music service, I'd probably pick the higher quality streams at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdi.fm%3AhaIlQ_NkRvf7WNC2Pec36aDe3VA&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="di.fm">di.fm</a>.</p></div>
