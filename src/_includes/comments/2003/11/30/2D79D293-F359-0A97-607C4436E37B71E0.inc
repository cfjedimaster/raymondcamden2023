		<div class="comment_text"><p>Nice one, Raymond. I've no kids, and no plans for any immediately, but I wholly respect people who adopt. Having your own when there are so many without parents seems quite selfish. Let alone overpopulation in a time of dwindling resources...</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I had never though of adoption, but 2 years ago my brother and is wife adopted an 12 year old girl.  She's great.</p><p>Since then I've wondered why the health requirements of the person adopting can't be re thought. Over weight and people that smoke are not the first choice of state adaption agencies.</p><p>My brother and his wife also foster children as needed.  They live in a small town in Tennessee and there's not many people who will foster.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yea, the physical requirements are a bit silly. What makes it worse is that each country has their own rules. Of course this only matters if you adopt out of country.</p></div>
