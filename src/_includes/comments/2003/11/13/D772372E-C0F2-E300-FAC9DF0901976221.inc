		<div class="comment_text"><p>I simply surfed over to livedocs for CFMX 6.1 and copied and pasted what the documentation said for the output attribute. I further indicated that it was from livedocs for CFMX 6.1. Granted I didn't include the URL, but there is only one URL that has the documentation for cffunction for CFMX 6.1 on livedocs, so I thought it was pretty obvious.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yup, hadn't noticed they were from different versions since I'd located them just by searching for "livedocs cffunction". Interesting that the 6.0 docs didn't mention the behavior of omitting the attribute but the 6.1 docs do mention it.</p><p>As you pointed out on the CFCDEV list, a lot of people don't know about this subtle behavior and even reading the docs it's easy to miss since that's effectively just a one-line change between versions...</p><p>I wonder if the behavior did actually change between 6.0 and 6.1 or whether it was just a doc change?</p></div>
