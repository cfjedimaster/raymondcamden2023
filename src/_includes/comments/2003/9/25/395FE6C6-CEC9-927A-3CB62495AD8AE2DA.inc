		<div class="comment_text"><p>I didn't mind Central, I thought it was pretty neat.  I like having a movie finder app right on my desktop instead of having to open a browser to go hunt down the Loews theater times, etc.</p><p>Couple of things tho:<br>1.) The console should snap to the edge of the screen or something.</p><p>2.) The console shouldn't take up an application space on my task bar.  If it's going to be something that I want ran in the background, then the systray icon is enough (and, it's already there, it's taking up 2 slots instead of just one).</p></div>
