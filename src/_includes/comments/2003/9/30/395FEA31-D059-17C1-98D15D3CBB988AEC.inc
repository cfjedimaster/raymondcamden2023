		<div class="comment_text"><p>It would be good to see better support for Oracle drivers as I use them all the time. We are still waiting for a fix to connect to our legacy Oracle Rdb DB -- as MX cannot connect by any means. Again this is an older database, but we did have connectivity through ODBC under CF 5. It would be good to see MM get behind some of these JDBC issues and work them out.</p></div>
