		<div class="comment_text"><p>sounds very cool!  i have the first two graphic novels (someday hope to have the rest...i've long since given up on the idea of getting all of the original issues).</p><p>definitely a great read whether you're a comic fan or not.  for those who don't know, this is *not* superheroes in tights saving damsels in distress.  this is simply amazing storytelling that happens to be accompanied by art :)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Gaiman is a master story teller. It looks as if it is all other authors though... was he involved with collaboration?</p><p>He is coming here to NC and I signed up to be at a meeting/booksigning for a book festival in Charlotte. It's 5 hrs away, but will be worth the drive.</p></div>
