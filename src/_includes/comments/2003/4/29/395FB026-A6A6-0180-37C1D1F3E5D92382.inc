		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray,</p><p>The way I read the EULA in the DRK 3, you CAN distribute the CF components that come with the DRK in your own applications, so long as you include the copyright notice in the Macromedia written code.  Now maybe CF_Unit isn''t considered a component as defined in the EULA, but if it''s not, then I don''t see any other definition for what it is listed in the EULA.</p></div>
