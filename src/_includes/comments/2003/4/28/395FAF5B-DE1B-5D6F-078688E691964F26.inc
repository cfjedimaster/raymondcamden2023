It will only be used to notify you of new posts.&lt;br&gt;<br>Comments page will offer to remember your info.&lt;br&gt;<br>Maybe category subscriptions - ie, sign up to get my CFML posts (and all comments). Of course, this means you won''t visit my blog, but I''m not posting for ad revenue, so it doesn''t matter. ;)</p></div>
