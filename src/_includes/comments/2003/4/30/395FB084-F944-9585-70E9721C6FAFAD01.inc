		<div class="comment_text"><p>A little off-topic, but my first real geek related job was doing tech support for HP printers.  I had to get my foot in the door somehow... I was only there for 3 months until I got my first web job at the University I was attending.</p><p>That said, the reason the HP printers get smudgy is because paper dust &amp; fibers attach themselves to the sticky ink which gets splattered on the print head.  Once the build-up is great enough (it doesn''t take much), those fibers will start brushing across the paper, hence the smearing problem.</p><p>Its too bad HP is starting to be so crappy.  Even their consumer printers used to be built like tanks.  During my short tech support career, only one printer was broken out of the 3-4,000 calls I took while I was there... the rest just needed cleaning or some other poking or prodding.</p><p>- Brandon</p><p>-----------------------<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooms.net%3ABBP85xf4MbtwwUResLW_-WhXfGU&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://booms.net">http://booms.net</a></p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I understand why it gets smudgy - I just don''t know why it happens so often. After cleaning, I get ''nice'' printouts for maybe a week - that''s it - and I''ve _never_ had a printer that needed to be cleaned so much. Is this a problem with most modern printers?</p></div>
