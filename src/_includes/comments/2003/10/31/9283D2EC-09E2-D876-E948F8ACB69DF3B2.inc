		<div class="comment_text"><p>hey ray</p><p>i share your feelings for commercial radio. horrible, horrible, horrible. however, on business recently, i had a rental car with XM radio in it. i'm completely hooked - especially on the portable device concept (between car and jambox). i think it might warrent the $10 a month (+ player). i really hope commercial radio (uh, clearchannel) is shaking in their boots. ;-)</p><p>and happy halloween of course!! boo!</p><p>g.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I gave up listening to crap on the radio during my commute as a new year's resolution a few years ago.  Surprisingly, it's the only resolution I've ever kept.  Now, I mostly listen to NPR.  When I was young, I didn't "get" public radio, but I do now.  At night, our NPR station is a Jazz station.  Didn't used to be into jazz either, but after listening for a while, I am now ;-)</p><p>When not going that route, I have a pretty huge MP3/CD collection, so I'm usually good to go on that front.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Halloween is pretty important to many adults around the world - All Hallow's Eve is the Celtic end of summer, the new year and also the start of the Day of the Dead which features greatly in many people's calendars. It's a big party for many, many reasons... but, like many such festivals, it has been commercialized by the card and candy companies (Halloween, Christmas, Easter...).</p></div>
