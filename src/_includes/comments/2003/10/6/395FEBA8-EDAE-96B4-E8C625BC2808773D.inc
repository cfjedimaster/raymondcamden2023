		<div class="comment_text"><p>I’m sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience with Dell. I have a story in which my computer began shutting off in much the same way you describe. Though never did pin down the cause, I too thought it could be related to CPU workload. But I had some shutoffs occur when I was certain the CPU was near idle.</p><p>I purchased a Dell Latitude C800 in June of 2001 and it worked perfectly (Once the LCD had to be replaced and another time the keyboard needed to be replaced, this was handled onsite by one of their friendly techs) until February of 2003 when one of the USB ports stopped working. A Dell technician came and replaced the entire motherboard because the USB ports were completely integrated. This was when the big problems started happening. With the new (refurbished actually) motherboard in, my Latitude C800 would shut off at least once every two hours. I’m talking about a cold, hard shut off. In spite of the random shut offs I was able to work (ctrl-S every 20 seconds) without losing data. After a call to Dell another tech came and replaced the motherboard again. This one had almost the same problem only now it was shutting off at least once every two days. Not as bad but still very disconcerting. Here’s where it gets interesting.</p><p>I called Dell and I must have spent 4 hours on the phone being very polite but relentless in my pursuit of satisfaction. I convinced Dell that I had good reason for not trusting their refurbished motherboards at this point. All I had to do was to wait for a call back from a “manager”. The manager called later that afternoon and informed my I would be receiving a brand new (not refurbished) Dell Latitude C840! The machine arrived and I transferred my data and settled in on the new machine. When comfortable that all was good I securely wiped all data the old laptop and sent it back to Dell.</p><p>I’m still using the Latitude C840 without a single trouble (knock on wood) and I’m very happy with Dell. I think overall I would have been most content to have never had the problem in the first place.</p><p>There are a couple things I’ve taken away from this experience:</p><p>1) Always, always, always be polite with the people on the other end of the phone. This doesn’t mean you have to roll over, be persistent and never give up but always be polite. This is hard for me because my blood has a very low boiling point with the “idiot monkeys” swinging from the corporate phone trees.</p><p>2) Always buy the expensive, next business day service, support plan upfront. Especially when buying a laptop. In my case the plan had already paid for itself with the replacement of the LCD and the keyboard. Add to that the 2 replaced motherboards and the entirely replaced laptop and the extended super service plan was well worth $300.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Having worked as a Technical Support Representative at a software company (that probably wishes to remain nameless) in the past, I can tell you that, for some reason people LOVE to lie about their computer abilities, what they've "already tried", and what they "swear they didn't do to the machine."</p><p>Kids would call trying to get brand new games to work on 5 year old machines, lacking the required hardware, downloading hacks off the net, and various other things that aren't (of course) supported. We would commonly make "crack smoking" files - lists of the strangest phone calls we had the "pleasure" of dealing with that day.</p><p>"Why can't I get your Windows 98 game to work on my Mac? Or on my old DOS computer?"</p><p>"I only have a 3.5" drive. This game is on 5.25 discs. If I cut the edges off so it's 3.5 in size, will it work in my drive?"</p><p>"I think your game reformatted my hard drive. I'm suing!"</p><p>and my personal favorite...</p><p>"I need a new instruction manual, because my pig at the last one."  (true story)</p><p>...and the like were all common phone calls for my group.</p><p>For whatever it's worth, the tech rep taking your call probably heard "I'm a software engineer, I know what I'm doing" 10 times that day, and 9 of the 10 didn't know what Ctrl-Alt-Delete does.  So when he/she gets to you, they're probably thinking "oh...ANOTHER supposed engineer" and walk you through the steps as they do everyone else, so they KNOW it was done that way, and can try to solve the problem with more of a known quantity.</p><p>I feel the same way you do about these calls, and I wish things worked differently (I had a similar problem calling Direct TV last week).  But having been in their shoes, I think I understand why they do it...even if I still don't agree. :)</p></div>
