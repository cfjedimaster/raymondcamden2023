		<div class="comment_text"><p>Funny, I didn't think I'd be buying anything off of iTunes anytime soon.  Then, just last night, my wife asked me if I had Robert Palmer's Addicted to Love in my collection.  She wanted to put it on a CD to take into her office as part of her team's themed Halloween costumes (they are dressing as the Robert Palmer girls).  iTunes to the rescue.  Rather than driving to the store to buy the whole album (which I couldn't do at 10:30 last night anyhow), I fired up my laptop, purchased, and downloaded the song in about a minute.  Now that's service!</p></div>
