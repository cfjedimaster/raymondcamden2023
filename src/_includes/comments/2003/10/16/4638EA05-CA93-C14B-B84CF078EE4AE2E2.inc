		<div class="comment_text"><p>Ray, just a comment (and this is mostly for the benefit of those who want to really see the article).</p><p>The link offered shows just a screenshot of the actual magazine cover, and the page it links to is just for subscriptions.</p><p>If instead one goes to the mag's online "front page", at <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsys-con.com%2Fcoldfusion%2F%3AM3FqwAAavGTIuRWfqusvrFaTQ78&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://sys-con.com/coldfusion/">http://sys-con.com/coldfusion/</a>, you'll see that in fact Ray's article is a featured one this month (with an intro to the article and a link offered for reading it) so that can be read even by non-subscribers. :-)</p></div>
