		<div class="comment_text"><p>I was on a recent QANTAS flight (the flying kangaroo) recently when the aircraft was struck by lightning.</p><p>This was a real freak-out affair - despite the aircraft not being badly damaged - the flight crew were less than professional which added to the "freak out" syndrome.</p><p>I LOVE the take-offs when the pilot punches the throttle - the sheer speed is - better than sex (apparently). Of course when the aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac for ages and develops "flat spots" on the tyres take-offs are not so enjoyable.</p><p>I HATE the landings however. Something about bringing something that ways more than a freight train (but flies) in for a smooth landing.</p><p>But the "flight club" did indeed offer beer - the real Aussie stuff (Victoria Bitter and Fosters) or Stolly and champers - and a favourite on rare occasions - Jim Beam - for my shattered nerves.</p><p>God bless the limo driver at the airport!</p></div>
