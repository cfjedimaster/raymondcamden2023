		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't agree enough on this point.  I am not a big fan of some of the tactics that larger coporations like Microsoft participates in but give me a break!  There is a lot of open source garbage out there equalling the amount of non-free garbage...  Stick to the one on one comparisons of OS or applications and not the "corporate versus non-corporate" points people tend to harp on too often.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I am agreeing with you.  In a nutshell, there are better and less destructive and heavy handed ways to sell concept of OSS.</p><p>They are not looking any better than the company they are trying to bring down in my humble opinion.</p></div>
