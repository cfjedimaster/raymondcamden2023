		<div class="comment_text"><p>Well, i don't live in the US, i'm just a little bit norther (Quebec, Canada) but i expect insurance laws and trends to be pretty much the same, since all insurance corp. are basically 3 or 4 big international groups.</p><p>So, up here, when an accident happens in a parking lot, there's always a 50%-50% responsability shared among drivers. The only exception is when you're not in the car. Insurance agent told me that it was too difficult and to much work for them to determine the true responsability and also that since it's low speed and low cost accident, it doesn't worth the time and money to investigate further.</p><p>The same kind of idiot ran into my car while my keys were not even in the contact. I got a 500$ deductible to pay for a 400$ reparation.</p><p>Insurances are a pain in the .... well you know !</p><p>Glad nobody was injured anyway !</p><p>Bye</p><p>K</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Join the club.  I was in my first major accident on Thursday (during the power outage.)  Some genius decided that he should just fly through intersections when the light was out and he nailed me good.  He did the same thing, getting all loud and trying to place blame.  Thank goodness for witnesses.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I'm surprised the cop didn't write a ticket for the others for driving without insurance.  Most states I believe require collision insurance to cover the other party in an accident.</p><p>Sadly, unless your insurance company can collect from theirs (which won't happen if they don't have insurance), you will pay the deductible.  Be happy you have insurance to cover the rest, and if the total cost isn't much higher than your deductible, it may make sense to not claim it.  Sure, there will already be a record (that may increase your rates in the future), but it may not increase them as much. ... at least you can go home with a smile knowing the other party has a lot higher 'deductible' (all!) and that they look like fools.  Afterall, a married family in a minivan can have a small dent or a slightly off color paint job and it isn't embarrasing.  Can you imagine how stupid the other party will be if they don't fix their sports car...hm, 20 somethings in a dented up car, or a fixed car with a less than stellar repainting :-)</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It looks like the front-end just fell off of that Firebird. Looks like a well made car (sarcasm intended). Glad you are alright. If it isn't that much ($$) in damage to the van, i wouldn't claim it. Don't give the insurance company a reason to raise your rates.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I live in Louisiana and had someone drive full-speed (more than full speed for my street... more like 40 mph!!) into my parked car. My insurance paid for everything above my deductible, and then recovered the deductible from the other driver's insurance and sent it to me later. If the other driver was in fact not insured, it may depend on whether you have a coverage that supplies coverage when the other driver is not insured... a provision that exists and is recommended in Louisiana for the obvious reasons!</p><p>Of course, YMMV (almost literally) depending on your insurance company and your particular policy, but in any case I would suspect that you will recover the above-deductible portion in one action and possibly the other portion through a different mechanism.</p><p>Hope this is helpful. And good luck. And thank goodness no one was hurt!</p></div>
