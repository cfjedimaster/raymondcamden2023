		<div class="comment_text"><p>I can't help but pick on EM:</p><p>I want to import from one to db to another. I right click on the destination and chose import. I forget the IP of the remote DB and click 'behind' the import wizard so I can scroll up my list of servers and find the IP. But... guess what - you can't because the wizard forces you to either complete it or cancel it. Why? Give me one good reason.</p><p>Another fun EM feature: Databases can have multiple users. I had set up a connection to a db server as one user. I needed to set up another user as well. But guess what - you can't have 2 connections to the same server, even if they are in a different group. Sure, I can prompt for login info every time, but why should I have to do that? What is rocket science about allowing for N connections to one SQL Server each with different username/password combos?</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>You should give Aqua Data Studio a try (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aquafold.com%3AYjAeZB9tyAfzWfb9FuXF9kz0MSM&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.aquafold.com">www.aquafold.com</a>). You can't do everything with it that EM does, but it is quite good.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>a remote call doesn't necessitate that behavior, it's just bad programming (all hail the a-sync callback)</p></div>
