		<div class="comment_text"><p>For one, this comments form is in a pop up, and not linked directly to your blog article.  Blog spammers find blog articles that are high in google rankings, and then leave comments on them to raise their own rankings.  However, since they can't technically leave comments on this page easy, unless they do it manually, they pass on by for easier prey.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>MovableType is an easy target because the comments URL is well-known. Your blog software uses an 'unknown' URL but I suspect if spammers began to find high-ranked Google articles on blogs powered by your software, they'll figure out your comments URL and spam will start appearing. I get hit about a dozen times a day - it's a pain!</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Lucky you. I just finished deleting 22 different blog spam since I woke up. To hell with these spammers, If I came across any of them, I will definitely give them a nice thrasing. If I can't do anything, I will throw a big stone at them from afar or many many stones.</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>It is definitely your blogging system. I was wondering about the same while ago, until I checked my 404 errors in my statistics... lots of attempts for well-known and all kind of comment management scripts and template files. Then I realized I wasn't so 'unpopular' among spammers, but my system is somewhat immune to their techniques for being custom-made.</p></div>
