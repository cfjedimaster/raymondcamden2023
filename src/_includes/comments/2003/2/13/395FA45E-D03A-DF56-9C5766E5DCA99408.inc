		<div class="comment_text"><p>Yolanda: YOu would need to upload the mpeg video to your server. Let's sayou put it in the same folder as your blog. You would then simply make a normal link to it in your blog posting. i.e.: a href="mympeg.mpg". When someone clicks on the link, the browser should hand off the video to the right application on the person's computer.</p></div>
