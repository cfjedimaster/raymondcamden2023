		<div class="comment_text"><p>One problem with $Log$ is that the comments just keep growing over time and if you do any branch development and then try to let CVS merge changes back into the trunk, $Log$ can really confuse it. It''s less of an issue if you put $Log$ in a comment at the *end* of your file. I''m less keen on $Log$ these days - developers can always run "cvs log" on the file itself to see all the change history.</p></div>
