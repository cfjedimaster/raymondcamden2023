		<div class="comment_text"><p>Hi Raymond,</p><p>I like getting the full post.  Since I''ve already read everything on your site it''s not like I click through your RSS "teaser" and then surf around - I just click through so I can read the rest of that one post.  I''ve heard two reasonable arguments for doing teasers instead of full posts:</p><p>[1] Your site relies on traffic (i.e. advertising) for revenue, so you need folks clicking through and surfing around.</p><p>[2] Your text is wedded to your presentation rather than standing alone, so you want your users to see your writing within the context of your site design.</p><p>For [1] (and I know this is not you), I say put your ads in the RSS feed.  If your content is worth reading, I''d still rather suck down the ads than click through.  And if it''s not, well...</p><p>For [2], I can understand this concern (again, not necessarily that you share it), but I''m all about the text, so I''d rather read what you have to say rather than admire how prettily it''s presented.  Not that I don''t appreciate a well-designed site when I''m surfing, but when I''m aggregating I just want the text.  I''ll click through if the presentation is important (like with Simon Willison''s excellent &lt;a href="<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsimon.incutio.com%2Fcategories%2Fcsstutorial%2F%3A_9X4HDNodj1SOr7rOruw7-jMqN0&amp;cuid=3321886" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://simon.incutio.com/categories/csstutorial/">http://simon.incutio.com/ca...</a>"&gt;CSS ain''t Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt; series.</p><p>Take care,</p><p>Jim</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>Make it a parameter and allow folks to say how big the excerpt should be:</p><p>generateRSS(mode="full")</p><p>or</p><p>generateRSS(excerpt=100)</p><p>mode, exceprt both optional, mode defaults to "partial", excerpt defaults to 250.</p><p>Personally I prefer to be able to read the entire entry in my RSS reader - since I''m usually reading RSS/news on BART (i.e., offline).</p></div>

		<div class="comment_text"><p>I think it''s pretty obvious how people feel. I plan on adding this along with some additions that Rob Brooks-Bilson had added. (Basically, the ability to pass params to generateRSS like you to getEntries - this will allow for getting a filter RSS feed.)</p></div>
