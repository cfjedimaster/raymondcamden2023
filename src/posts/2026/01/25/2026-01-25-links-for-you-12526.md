I write this in the midst of a huge ice event - which thankfully isn't so bad here in south Louisiana. We're very cold and rainy, but no real ice yet, which is good. The worst is coming in later tonight and the schools have already shut down, but thankfully I work at home so there's no need to get on the roads. Today is also the 26th birthday of my eldest child, which makes the age ranges of my little army (8 kids total) go from 10 to 26. Wow. 

## Temporal is Coming... 

Ok, most likely you've seen this across your feeds already, I swear I saw it at least ten times, but ["Date is out, Temporal is in"](https://piccalil.li/blog/date-is-out-and-temporal-is-in/) is a great introduction to the new date hotness in JavaScript, the Temporal API. 

According to MDN, the [support is good](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal#browser_compatibility) so I imagine I'll be using this soon myself.

## The Personal Site is Back!

Or at least that's what I hear. Personally, I miss seeing all the cute, weird, personal web pages from the old days, so any effort to help promote this trend is a good thing in my book. [Personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/) is a collection of personal web sites and a quick way to hop to a [random](https://personalsit.es/random) one. Anyone can submit a PR to add your own. (I did!)

## Free APIs to Get Your Hack On

This isn't new, but I love a good API, and what's better than one good API? How about near 500 of them! [Free Public APIs](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) is exactly what it sounds like, a collection of free APIs. Building simple API wrappers are a *great* way to learn a new language. Sadly though there are only [three cat APIs](https://www.freepublicapis.com/tags/search/cats?query=cats) - someone fix that please!

## Just For Fun 

Another music discovery for me, hemlocke springs is an American singer and songwriter who just started being active in the music scene over the past few years. She's got a great sound, and while this is the only track I've tried so far, I'm looking forward to listening to more from her.
