Happy Superb Owl Day! As my team didn't even get close to the playoffs, I'll be rooting for the Seahawks, but even more so, hoping for a fun game. Tomorrow I head out to Vegas for my first offsite with Webflow, and the first in-person company event I've been too since Auth0 nearly a decade ago. I'm looking forward to meeting my teammates in person and meeting new people. Now - to the links!

## Adding Touch to PowerShell

A few months back, I traded in my Windows laptop (it was having horrible hardware issues) and moved back to Mac. I've gone back and forth over the years, and even when I was on Windows for my personal machine, my work laptop was usually a Mac, but I've decided to go back to Mac for my personal machine ... at least for a while. That being said, one of the aspects of Windows I wanted to get into more, but never got around to it, was scripting in PowerShell. I knew it had a *lot* of power and flexibility, but I spent most my time in WSL so I didn't really dig into it. 

This post by [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/) demonstrates a simple example of this, rebuilding the [touch command for PowerShell](https://cassidoo.co/post/touch-on-ps/?utm_source=cassidoo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=happiness-is-a-choice-that-requires-effort-at). On the offhand chance you don't know what touch does, it simply creates a new blank file with the name you specify, so `touch cats.txt` will create the file `cats.txt` in your current directory. Apparently, Windows has a command like this already, `ni`, but Cassidy wanted to use the same function in multiple OSes. 

## Invokers on the Web

Next up is a look at [invoker commands](https://pawelgrzybek.com/more-invoker-commands-and-more-reasons-not-to-use-javascript-please/) by [Pawel Grzybak](https://pawelgrzybek.com/). Invoker commands let you bind HTML elements to actions without needing JavaScript, and are available across all modern browsers (even <strike>IE</strike>Safari). You can extend the built-in invoker support with JavaScript as well.

## State of JavaScript Results

Last up are the results from the annual [State of JavaScript](https://2025.stateofjs.com/en-US) survey. This is a *wide* ranging survey of the JavaScript, and greater web, ecosystem. It's quite a bit of data and worth your time checking out.

## Just For Fun

Usually I reserve the "fun" link for music videos, but this was just too good to pass up. My buddy [Todd Sharp](https://recursive.codes/) discovered this a few days ago and it's a fascinating look at the history of the Japanese mail system. Trust me, it is *absolutely* cooler than it sounds, and a quick read at that. Enjoy!
