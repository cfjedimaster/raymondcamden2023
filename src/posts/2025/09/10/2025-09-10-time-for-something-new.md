So, maybe you're noticing a new look here. Or maybe this is your first time here. Either way, welcome to the new (and hopefully) improved raymondcamden.com, my little home on the internet.

For the past few weeks, I've been sharing my experience using GenAI to generate a blog theme on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/user/theraymondcamden). My plan was to share those results here and ask folks which theme they thought would be best. I still plan on sharing those results here, but yesterday while frustrated and anxious, I decided, screw it, one theme really spoke to me, and it's the one you see here. While I know I've still got stuff to fix here and there, I'm really happy with this update and I hope yall like it. Or if not, I hope it doesn't bug you enough to never return. ;) 

As an FYI, the actual tech stack didn't change at all. I'm still using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and writing most of my content in Markdown. If you're bored, you can dig into the [source code](https://github.com/cfjedimaster/raymondcamden2023) and see how I've patched this huge (nearly 7000 page) beast of a site together.
