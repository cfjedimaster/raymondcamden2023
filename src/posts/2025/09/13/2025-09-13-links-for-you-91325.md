Yeah, I'm not even going to try to comment on this past week. I can say I had two interviews, which I think went well, and I finished some demos I've been working for a while, so that's a positive. Outside of that, just want to not think too much about the state of things and focus on sharing awesome, nutritious links for you to enjoy.

## Intl and Segmenters

You know me and you know I love the [Intl API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl), so first up is a look at getting [accurate text lengths](https://blog.sangeeth.dev/posts/accurate-text-lengths-with-intl-segmenter-api/) using Intl and the Segmenter feature. This post comes to us from [Sangeeth Sudheer](https://blog.sangeeth.dev/) with the nicely named "Automagic" blog.

## Flight Data to the Database

Next up is an incredibly cool post that demonstrates streaming [real-time flight data from MS Flight Simulator](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/flight-telemetry-monitoring-influxdb-3-enterprise/) into InfluxDB 3. I've been a fan of Microsoft's Flight Sim since version 1 or so, but I had no idea you could hook into the data being generated from it. [Heather Downing ](https://www.quorralyne.com/) does a great job explaining all the details here, and it's definitely worth a read. 

## An Intro from Doctor JavaScript

Ok, "Doctor JavaScript" isn't a name he goes by, but it just suddenly made sense to me, so I'm going with it. I've shared posts from [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://dr-axel.de/) many times here and he easily the world's expert on JavaScript and has an incredibly deep understanding of the language. Last month, he began a new series for people [learning web development](https://2ality.com/2025/08/learning-web-dev-toc.html) that I recommend checking out, even if you've been in the biz for a while. As of today, he has <strong>12</strong> comprehensive posts covering multiple different aspects. Check it out!

## Just For Fun

Last up is an incredible song by a new artist (new to me anyway), John Glacier. That's not the artist's real name, but is instead the stage name of a rapper from England. You can read more about her [here](https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/55809/1/john-glacier-a-renegade-rapper-on-the-rise-interview), an article from 2022, so I was definitely late in discovering her. Anyway, this track is absolutely incredible:
