As I mentioned on the blog a few weeks ago, I (finally) landed a new job. The market is *beyond* tough right now, so I'm very happy that I was able to land a new role, especially one that's going to be just about perfect for me - API Evangelist for [Foxit](https://www.foxit.com/). I'll be talking more about my role and what I'm covering later (we've got some really cool stuff brewing!) but for now, I can't wait to get busy again!
