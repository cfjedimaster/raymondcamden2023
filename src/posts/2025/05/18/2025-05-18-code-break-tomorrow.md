description: Quick note about my next Code Break episode.

Just a quick note to let my subscribers know that my next Code Break session will be tomorrow, May 19th, at 12PM CST. I plan on continuing my look at [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), a platform for using the web platform to build desktop apps. Depending on how much time I've got, I may also start playing with a Python platform as well. You can RSVP, or just watch, here: <https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-05192025/>.
