description: Happy Holiday Weekend Links
---

I missed posting my links post last weekend but I had an absolutely good reason. This previous week was my first week at [Foxit](https://www.foxit.com) and while I've only had three days so far, I'm incredibly excited about this new role and being able to introduce a whole suite of new offerings to developers. The next few months are going to be pretty busy and I'm really happy about that. My new job also coincided with a little vacation my wife and I are taking in Saint Louis. While I've been in Louisiana for sometime now, I grew up in Saint Louis and love visiting here. (My mom still lives up here.) Yesterday we visited the [Missouri Botanical Garden](https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/) which was beautiful. 

This isn't a pretty picture, but I LOLed at the name:

Ok, on with the links!

## Learning about MCP

MCP is *incredibly* hot now in the AI world, and it's something I've yet to truly wrap my head around yet. I plan on getting up to speed with it more very soon, but I thought it would be useful for folks in the same boat to point out an excellent series of articles by Todd Sharp (this is the third week in a row I've led with one of his articles so it's something of a trend now): [Hype or Hope - Is MCP The Missing Piece of the Puzzle?](https://dev.to/aws/hype-or-hope-is-mcp-the-missing-piece-of-the-llm-puzzle-c88).

This is part one of a four part series, so buckle up and be ready to learn. 

## On Being Principal Developer Advocate

Next up is a good read on the good, and bad, of being the principal developer advocate in an organization. [Dewan Ahmed](https://www.dewanahmed.com/) wrote about the challenges facing developer advocates in regards to the great freedom the role has in opposition to the great responsibility as well. It's a great read: [The Principal Developer Advocate Paradox: Scaling Impact Without Burnout](https://www.dewanahmed.com/being-principal-da/)

## Tips and Tricks for Better File Uploads

Last up is a good set of tips for better file uploads in your web apps: [7 Best Practices of File Upload With JavaScript](https://storagebowl.net/blogs/best-practices-of-file-upload). Most of these are things I knew already, but haven't really thought about in a nice list here as written by [StorageBowl](https://storagebowl.net/). (Who, conveniently, offer a storage solution that I probably need to play with soon.)

## Just For Fun

My readers know I love a good cover (in fact, I've got a nearly 11 hour Spotify playlist of covers) so why not enjoy this *really good* cover of The Cure's "Burn" by NITE:
