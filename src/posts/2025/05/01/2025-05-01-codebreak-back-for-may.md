description: Info on my next Code Break
---

Hey folks, after a break last month (for reasons), I'm happy to announce that [Code Break](https://cfe.dev/talkshow/code-break/) is back on schedule. I'm ditching any further exploration of React for now, but instead turning my attention to something I think is really fun - building desktop apps. This first session will focus on a JavaScript-based framework while my next one will cover using Python. 

My next session will *not* be on a Tuesday, but Monday, May 5th, at 12PM CST. You can RSVP/sign up/etc here: <https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-05052025/>

I hope to see you there!
