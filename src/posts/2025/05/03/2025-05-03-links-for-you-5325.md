Happy Saturday, Happy Pre-May the 4th, and happy "I don't have to beg for a job anymore". Yep, I've got a job. I'm going to be announcing where and what later this month when I start, but, finally, I can stop the hunt. Oh, and the crippling fear and despair being gone is an added bonus. So, happy day! Let's get to the links.

## Tubes, tubes, tubes

Last week I started off with a post from Todd Sharp so why not do it again? Todd wrote up his experience using [Momento Topics API and Nixie Tubes](https://dev.to/recursivecodes/using-the-momento-topics-http-api-to-update-nixie-tubes-3d18). Nixie Tubs are beautiful steam punk looking tubes that can be connected to hardware and then changed programmatically. I did a bit of hardware hacking last year but the project Todd describes here is way beyond my skill set. 

## Handling Light and Dark Mode for Images

While this post mentions both Markdown and GitHub in the title, the [guide](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-make-your-images-in-markdown-on-github-adjust-for-dark-mode-and-light-mode/) is actually a great HTML tip that shows you how easy it is to have your images support light and dark mode.

This tip is from Cassidy Williams and her excellent [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/).

## Tracking Web Analytics with Val Town

Last up is a [good article](https://orjpap.github.io/valtown/http/analytics/blog/jekyll/2025/04/15/blog-analytics.html) by Orestis Papadopoulos on using [Val Town](https://www.val.town/dashboard) to track web analytics. I used Val Town in an [earlier post](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2025/04/30/a-test-of-eleventy-fetch) to stand up a simple API and it's a service I've been meaning to dig more into for like a year now. Orestis' [article](https://orjpap.github.io/valtown/http/analytics/blog/jekyll/2025/04/15/blog-analytics.html) is a great example of why the service is so cool.

## Just For Fun

Did I mention I got a job? I did? Well, I got a job. Which means (at least for now and completely ignoring everything going on in the country) ...
