Sadly, I find myself in the same situation I did a few months ago. My time at Foxit has abruptly come to an end. While it didn't work out, I am *incredibly* proud of what I was able to achieve in such short time. I'm a bit in shock now, but, I love my work, I love helping developers, and I can't *not* work if my kids want to eat. (Rudely they tend to get hungry - like every single day.) As always, if you know me, and know of an opportunity, I'd love any introductions you can give. I got through this once, I can get through it again!
