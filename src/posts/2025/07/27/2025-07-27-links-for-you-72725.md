description: Links... just links

Good afternoon, programs. This past week was... frustrating. Incredibly slow. Don't really want to get into it but luckily I've had a very lazy and relaxing weekend. I'm counting my blessings but - like I said - frustrating. Let's just get to the links, shall we?

## Importing JSON is Easier Now 

Normally when importing JSON into my code, I'll do a `fetch` and parse the response into JSON. Not a big deal, but, it's now simpler as explained by Thomas Steiner on the web.dev blog: ["JSON module scripts are now Baseline Newly available"](https://web.dev/blog/json-imports-baseline-newly-available). This feature is "Baseline" available means it works in modern browsers. Check the post for a full example, but here's a one-liner:

```js
import astronomyPictureOfTheDay from "./apod.json" with { type: "json" };
```

I think for the most part it just works, but do note the warning in the post to ensure you server JSON files with the right content type. (Also, Thomas Steiner is the guy who helps me/comments on my Chrome AI posts and he's been super helpful!)

## Old School Weather

I *love* weather apps, sites, and APIs. I can't get enough of them. I *especially* love this old-school retro-TV interface at [WeatherStar 3000+](https://weatherstar3000.netbymatt.com/).

## Literature and Calendars

I've recently done a few posts on calendars with [BoxLang](https://boxlang.io), so calendars have been on my mind lately. This post on Reactor discusses [different books and calendaring systems](https://reactormag.com/counting-the-days-five-sff-approaches-to-calendars/), specifically focusing on how it impacts the story, reflects what's important to the society discussed in the books, and so forth. It sounds very academic, but it's honestly a good short read and great food for thought.

## Just For Fun

Lastly, a few days ago my wife introduced me to Laufey, an Icelandic singer who is a bit Bluesy, folksy, poppy, etc. A fantastic blend. I feel like I'm still getting to know her music so while this track may not be my favorite so far, I thought it was a pretty cool video. Enjoy!
