description: Upcoming Presentations and stuff!
---

Hey folks. Next week I've got not one, not two, but three different presentations happening. Here's what I've got going on.

## Code Break Episode 29

My next [Code Break episode](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-07082025/) will be Tuesday, July 8th at 12PM CST. I'll be doing some playing around with vibe coding, and yes, I still hate that term. But I've had some recent successes, and failures, with it and I thought it would be fun to explore. Whether you are pro, or anti, generating code with AI, I'd love to have you come in and share your feedback. 

## The DevRel Show

I'll be on Frédéric Harper's DevRel show on July 10th at 2PM CST, talking about APIs, specifically [Foxit APIs](https://developer-api.foxit.com). This is my first time on his show and the first time I'll be talking publicly about our new APIs, so I'm pretty excited. Here's the direct link to the stream: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSrhIwRWIe0> 

## The Ben and Ryan Show

Ok, let me start off by saying I don't have a link for this one yet, sorry, I should have it Monday and in theory I could have waited to post this till then, but with Code Break coming up soon I wanted to get it out the door before the weekend. I'll be joining Ben Nadel and Ryan Brown on their show, appropriately named "The Ben and Ryan Show", also on July 10th (busy day!) at 12PM CST. I'm 90% certain of that. ;) As soon as I get a link, I'll edit this post so just check back and you'll get the deets then (as the kids say).
