So my last [Code Break](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-03062025/) was... painful. My experience trying to learn React did not go well. Because of that I thought strongly about giving up, but what fun would that be? Join me tomorrow (March 18th) at 12PM CST where I'll, once again, try to learn some basic React features and get a trivial web site built. Will I make it? Probably not! But you can come join me and cheer/heckle me on! I hope to see you there:
