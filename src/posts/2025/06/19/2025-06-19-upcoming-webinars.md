description: News on two upcoming webinars by yours truly.
---

Good morning, programs. I wanted to share some news about two upcoming webinars. The first is my next Code Break show, ["Building Desktop Apps with Python and Flet - Part Deux"](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-06242025/), happening next Tuesday, June 24th, at 12PM CST. As you can tell by the title, I'll be continuing my look at the *awesome* [Flet](https://flet.dev/) project and seeing if I can finish the app I started last time. If you don't remember, it's quite deadly... (And be sure to check out the [last session](https://youtu.be/rzMfd-rwjcI) for the first part!)

Next, on July 23rd, 11AM CST, I'm hosting a free webinar where I'll live code [building a BoxLang application](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/free-webinar-build-an-app-in-boxlang-with-raymond-camden-tickets-1416084208989?aff=oddtdtcreator). My plan is to see how far I can get in an hour (which means I need to figure out what I'm building soon-ish) and if it's a success, I'll follow up with a second part and keep hacking away. I'm sure you've seen my [BoxLang](https://boxlang.io) posts, but if you haven't given it a try yet, this will be a great time to see it in action. I hope to see you there!
