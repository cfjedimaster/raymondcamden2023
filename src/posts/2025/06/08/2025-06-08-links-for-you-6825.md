Welcome to another edition of my "this was supposed to be down on Saturday" biweekly list of links. Yesterday my wife and I made pretzels at home for the first time. It was a rather simple recipe that didn't need any boiling and they came out incredible. We also watched the new Predator movie, [Killer of Killers](https://letterboxd.com/film/predator-killer-of-killers/), which was quite spectacular. I definitely recommend watching it when you can. Ok, on with the links!

## Releative Colors in CSS

CSS never ceases to amaze me, despite me knowing I'll never be really good at it. In this article by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/), he introduces the concept of native color modifying in pure CSS. Ie, taking one base color and changing it to be lighter or darker. It looks relatively simple to use and is [supported](https://webstatus.dev/features/relative-color) well. Read more at his blog post: [Relative Colors](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-relative-colors/). Also note that his post has some great interactive elements to it.

## Yet Another SSG

Yes, I'm sharing a link to another static site generator, but [Publican](https://publican.dev/) looks kinda cool. It's Node.js based with all the usual bells and whistles of SSGs, Markdown support, templates, and so forth. It makes use of [jsTSACS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstacs) for templating. (A lot of times the template engine is the deciding factor for me.) You can read more about the rationale for building another SSG at the product's blog: [Why create another static site generator?](https://publican.dev/news/why-another-ssg/).

## Implementing Image Uploads in the Background

Last up is a great article by [Amejimaobari Ollornwi](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/amejimaobari-ollornwi/) on building an [offline friendly image upload system](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/04/building-offline-friendly-image-upload-system/). This makes use of IndexedDB and the `sync` feature of service workers, something I've rarely seen people using. I've got a few nits about his use of IDB (see my comment at the end of the article), but it's a dang good example!

## Just For Fun

Last but not least, did you know Garbage released a new album *and* it's pretty damn good? Check out one of the singles below:
