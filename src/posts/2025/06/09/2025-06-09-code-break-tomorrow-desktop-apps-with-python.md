Greetings, programs. Tomorrow (June 10th) at 12PM CST (Cool Standard Time), I'll be hosting my next Code Break, ["Build Desktop Apps with Python and Flet"](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-06102025/). My last two sessions covered building desktop apps with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), a TypeScript/Rust platform, so I'm looking forward to playing with a Python version of the same idea.
