description: Yet another Sunday...
---

Greetings, programs. This has been a quite excellent weekend so far, and today will be awesome for one reason alone - there's not one dang thing on our calendar. A day with nothing to do is a glorious day indeed. I spent this morning finishing prestige 10 in COD and catching up on my comics ("One World Under Doom" is incredible). Now let's get to the links...

## What exactly do I do?

I've had to explain developer advocacy and evangelism for years now, but I absolutely love this explanation by [Ashley Willis](https://ashley.dev/blog/), ["What Is Developer Advocacy (2025 Edition)"](https://ashley.dev/posts/what-is-developer-advocacy/). In it, she goes into great detail about the job myself, and many of my friends, love, and talks about how the role has changed in the both post-COVID and in the current economic hellscape. (Have I mentioned how happy I am to have a job?) It's a great read and worth your time. 

## Yet Another Josh Comeau Link

I've shared [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) links *many* times here and his ability to explain technical matter with incredibly simple and well-built demos is easily the best in the industry. His [Operator Lookup](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/) tool is no exception. If you were ever curious about random and unusual JavaScript operators then this tool will explain them in detail. As an example, here's the [Logical AND Assignment Operator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup?match=logical-and-assignment). That was one I had absolutely zero clue about.

## Did You Know CSS Could...

Did you know CSS could style alt text for images? I didn't. [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/author/andy-bell) goes into great detail about how CSS can be used to [style alt text in images](https://piccalil.li/blog/you-can-style-alt-text-like-any-other-text/) with plenty of great examples. Frankly I'm at a point where I think CSS can pretty much do anything. 

## Just For (Musical) Fun

Ok, this isn't really a fun song, it's actually quite moody and brings up way too many emotions in me, which makes it an incredible song. I play this one almost daily, although I try to avoid if I'm already in anxious/depressed mood.
