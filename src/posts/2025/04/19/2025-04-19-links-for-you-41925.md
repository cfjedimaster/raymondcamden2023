Normally I preface these posts with little updates and such, but I'm too busy today and am sitting on what could (possibly) be good news. So, let's just get right into the links, shall we?

## Translating Live Streams in Real-Time with On-Device AI Models

I've been *real* excited about Chrome's upcoming [AI on device](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) efforts, so when my buddy Todd Sharp wrote up a cool demo of it, I had to share. In his [post](https://dev.to/aws/translating-live-streams-in-real-time-with-on-device-ai-models-p5b), Todd describes using on device transcription of a video source that then makes use of Chrome's new AI feature to perform translation on the viewer's side. Obviously this only works in Chrome Canary, but as an option in the future when it's mainline, this would be absolutely awesome for video streams, especially since the translation is all on device. 

## BASIC Python

Not basic Python, but [BASIC in Python](https://github.com/richpl/PyBasic). For those of us elderly people, BASIC was often the first language we learned on, and now you can parse/run BASIC code in Python itself. You can even save and load in BASIC files from the file system and the [repo](https://github.com/richpl/PyBasic) includes some examples, including Oregon Trailer. (Spoiler - you **will** die of dsyentry.)

## MySQL and MCP

Anyone doing anything in GenAI lately has heard about MCP. I've only done a bit of research into it so far, and honestly, I'm both excited for it and disappointed it's not this:

Ignoring that for now, you should definitely read this blog post by my other good buddy Scott Stroz where he explains how to connect [MySQL with MCP](https://stroz.dev/posts/2025/april/mysql-mcp/) and demonstrates with some interesting golf data. (Ok, don't tell Scott, I don't find golf that interesting, but what he did with his golf data was absolutely fascinating.)

## Just For Fun

I've been subscribed to [@matt one](https://www.youtube.com/@matt_one) on YouTube for a few weeks now and I believe I probably shared one of his videos before. He creates some pretty stellar remixes and mashups. This one is a remix of one of my favorite Cure songs and I hope you like it too:
