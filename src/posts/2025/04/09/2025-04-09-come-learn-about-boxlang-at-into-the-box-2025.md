description: About my upcoming speaking engagement.
---

Later this month, I'll be speaking at [Into the Box 2025](https://www.intothebox.org/) in Washington, DC and online. I've spoken at Into the Box in the past and the Ortus team puts on a great show, so I'd absolutely suggest checking it out if you can. In person tickets are [available](https://intothebox2025.eventbrite.com/), although close to selling out.  The [virtual event](https://itb_virtual_2025.eventbrite.com/) gives you everything the in person event does minus the workshops. 

What will I be speaking about? [BoxLang](https://boxlang.io) of course! I'll be giving an [introductory session](https://www.intothebox.org/into-the-box/sessions/detail?slug=sessions/getting-started-with-boxlang) on the language and talking about how you can start using it today. I promise multiple, enterprise-worthy cat demos to go along with it!

Come join me and many others!
