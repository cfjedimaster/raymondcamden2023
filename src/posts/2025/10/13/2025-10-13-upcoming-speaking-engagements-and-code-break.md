With full-time employment being a bit up in the air this year, I've not submitted to nearly as many conferences as I have in the past (but hey, my rejections are at an all-time low!), but I've actually got not one, but two upcoming talks this month. 

First up I'll be giving an introduction to [BoxLang](https://boxlang.io) to the Mid-Michigan CFUG user group on October 21st. You can find details here, <https://mmcfug.org/>. This meeting is 100% open to the public so if you've been curious about BoxLang from my posts here, you can get yourself a good intro later this month. 

Next, and this is somewhat new for me, but I'll be giving a presentation on something near and dear to my heart, developer relations and advocacy. I'll be presenting to the [Tech Academy](https://www.meetup.com/techacademy/) online on one of my favorite days of the year, Halloween. You can find the details, and RSVP, here: [Tech Talk | Developer Relations and Advocacy: A Career in Explaining](https://www.meetup.com/techacademy/events/311363457/).

## Code Break

I [launched](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/01/22/my-new-show-codebr) Code Break (sometimes `<Code><Br>`) back in January 2024, and since then have run [twenty-seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRUsvAR4oQ&list=PL_z-rqJYNijqhtPcEbwacp34TiFfb8eyO) episodes of me exploring, building, and sharing, while many of yall provided feedback and kept me on my toes. 

As I've said (maybe too much), this year and the job situation has made it difficult to find time to host the show, and I've been on an unannounced break for the past few months. 

I fully attend on starting the show again. I love that I had 'regulars' showing up and felt like it was really picking up steam before, well, life hit me with a curveball. It's coming back. I'm going to get a job. Life is going to go from incredibly chaotic and scary to "normal" chaotic and scary and I'll be in a much better place to be able to host the show. That being said, it will no longer be on Certified Fresh Events. 

Last month, Brian Rinaldi [announced](https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/the-future-of-cfe/) that CFE is shutting down after nine years. CFE was an incredible resource for the development community and I'm incredibly proud of what Brian worked so hard to build. Brian has been both a resource to the tech world and, more importantly, a dear friend of mine. He's the combo of being smart and a damn fine person which is rare. 

When I bring Code Break back, most likely I'll be starting a new Twitch stream. That will be new for me, but I absolutely want to continue what I started, and see those familiar faces in the audience again. 

I hope to see you there!
