description: Happy (Almost) Halloween Links
---

Greetings, programs, and welcome to another links post. The weather is *finally* beginning to turn here which doesn't necessarily mean cold weather, but days in the low 80s, mid 70s, which is an absolute relief from summer. Just in time for Halloween as well. Last year we unfortunately got rained out - this year it looks to be clear, and I can't wait to walk with my kids (and yes, I'll be in full costume myself). Here are some links for your reading enjoyment. Stay safe out there.

## On DevRel and the Unnatural Act

Up first is a stellar post by Leon Adato, [HOW TO DEVREL: The Most Un-Natural Act](https://adatosystems.com/2025/09/25/how-to-devrel-the-most-un-natural-act/). In his post, he describes how he not only got people to stop by his company booth but to also partake in a challenge that involved setting up a game with monitoring. I can attest to this working because I actually *saw* this at a conference, was immediately drawn to it, and did the challenge.

## Eleventy Performance Tips 

I haven't blogged about [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) in quite some time, mostly because it "just works" and continues to be awesome. Alex Russel is a recent (I believe) user of Eleventy and shared a [bunch of cool tips](https://infrequently.org/2025/10/11ty-hacks-for-fun-and-performance/?utm_source=11tybundle&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=11ty-bundle-issue-79-8f54#bonus-hack%3A-global-acronyms-for-better-%3Cabbr%3Es) for how to get the most performance out of it. As an FYI, I found out about this article thanks to the excellent [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/) newsletter.

## Abort Your Lack of Knowledge about Abort

Finally, an older post, but ["Dont Sleep on AbortController"](https://kettanaito.com/blog/dont-sleep-on-abort-controller) is the first blog post on `AbortController` that really clicked with me. This is a great overview by [Artem](https://kettanaito.com/) and credit goes to [Stefan Judis](https://front-end.social/@stefan) for sharing the post on Mastodon.

## Just For Fun

Last but not least, I'm not sharing a music video for once, but rather a fascinating project called [WindowSwap](https://www.window-swap.com/Window). WindowSwap shows random videos taken from windows around the world. I can't stop watching this.
