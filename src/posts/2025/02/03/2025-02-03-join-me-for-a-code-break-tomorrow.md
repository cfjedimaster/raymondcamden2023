Greetings, programs! This is just a quick reminder that my installment of `<Code><Br>` will be tomorrow, February 4th, at 12PM CST. You can find details and RSVP below:

<https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-02042025/>

I plan on continuing my look at generative AI with Google Gemini. If you didn't catch the last session (you can watch the recording [here](https://youtu.be/lbMYi59xPjA)), I did a quick introduction to generative AI with Gemini and tested multimodal input by having it scan and give feedback on my resume. I then began building a Flask web app to make the process more dynamic.
