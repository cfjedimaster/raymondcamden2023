Greetings, programs. I'm writing this from the deep, deep south where my kids were all off school this week because of... snow. I kid you not. On Tuesday we got around ten inches of snow, more than the area's ever seen in recorded history I believe. I grew up in Saint Louis so I've seen snow before, but in the nearly twenty-five years I've been here there's never been anything like it.

The snow is pretty much gone already (I think the high today will be near 70), but I'm so happy the kids got a chance to play in the snow, just like I did, many many years ago.

## JavaScript Import Maps

This is a pretty cool article. [Victorio Lo](https://lo-victoria.com/) demonstrates how to implement [JavaScript import maps](https://12daysofweb.dev/2024/js-import-maps/?utm_source=12daysofweb&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=day-8-2542) to help you skip build tools in your development process. This is a feature supported in all modern browsers so it's something you can start using right away. 

While you check out the article, be sure to head up to the rest of the site, [12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev/), which has a great set of web platform articles from last month. 

## What's New in Node

I feel like I've mentioned this before, but I really feel like Node.js has been improving quicker than I can catch up, specifically in the areas *outside* core language stuff. Built-in features and such that help with your development in general. In ["10 modern Node.js runtime features to start using in 2024"](https://snyk.io/blog/10-modern-node-js-runtime-features/), [Liran Tal](https://snyk.io/contributors/liran-tal/) does a great job covering the things you may not have known that were added to Node recently. I'm happy to say I knew six of these and was still able to learn quite a bit from the article. Definitely check it out.

## Music Metadata

About twenty of so years ago, back when I was doing a lot of ColdFusion, I can remember doing a bit of research into MP3s and building some simple code that would read in a mp3 file and extract the embedded metadata. It wasn't great code, but it worked. Honestly, I haven't thought about that since then, but the [music-metadata](https://github.com/borewit/music-metadata) project aims to provide similar functionality for Node.js, and a whole lot more. Support covers MP3s, WAV, AIFF and more and can nicely support large audio files. Be sure to check out the [Winamp-inspired online demo](https://webamp.org/) as well. 

## And last but not least...

My friends know I love a good mashup, and I can't think of anything better than a Chemical Brothers/Star Wars mashup. Enjoy!
