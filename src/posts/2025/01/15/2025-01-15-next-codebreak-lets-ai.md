description: Announcing the next Code Break session on AI
---

Hey folks! One of the things I promised to do better with the [Code Break](https://cfe.dev/talkshow/code-break/) show was scheduling. With that being said, I'm here to announce the next event and I've got about 4 already on the calendar after that. Hopefully this year I can get a bit more consistent with schedule. That being said, we'll see. Life is crazy at times. ;)

Ok, with that out of the way, my next session is Tuesday, January 21, at 12PM CST. I'll be talking about AI, specifically Generative AI, with a focus on Google Gemini, but also client-side stuff as well (with Chrome's built-in support and Transformers.js). I imagine this topic will cover two or more sessions. We'll see how much I get covered. 

In the meantime, you can find more details and RSVP here: <https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-01212025/>
