On September 11th, [Todd Sharp](https://recursive.codes/), [Scott Stroz](https://scottstroz.com/), and myself will be launching a new livestream called [The Undefined Show](https://www.twitch.tv/theundefinedshow). Every Monday at 8 PM EST, we'll be hosting a session on different topics, including development, languages, developer relations, and most likely quite a bit of non-technical things as well. Heck, at bare minimum, join us to heckle!
