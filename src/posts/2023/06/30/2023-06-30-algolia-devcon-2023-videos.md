description: Links to the Algolia DevCon 2023 Playlist
---

Normally I save links for the "Links for You" post I do a few times a month, but as I've been a bit quiet here recently (most of my side work has been on my Alpine.js video series), I thought I'd share this quick note. This week, [Algolia](https://algolia.com) held an online conference (DevCon) with two days of short presentations about their products, demos, and so forth. I've only had a chance to watch the first two so far, but over the next week, I'm going to try to watch them all. There's some *great* stuff in the playlist, including, of course, a lot of AI-related material as well as examples of real-world Algolia. 

As a reminder, I use Algolia on my [search](/search) here, and it's been incredible for me (and hopefully my readers). 

Anyway, check out the playlist below:
