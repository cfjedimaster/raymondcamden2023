description: Announcing my first Web Components presentation.
---

I am *super* excited (and a bit scared) to announce I'll be giving my first presentation on web components later this month. On May 30th, at 8 PM CST, I'll be presenting virtually to the [.Net User Group of British Columbia](https://www.meetup.com/net-user-group-of-bc/). This presentation will be online and open to anyone and will be recorded as well. 

I've really been enjoying digging into [web components](https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/web+components/) and I'm excited to have a chance to digest, summarize, and share what I've learned with all of yall. 

To sign up, just RSVP here: <https://www.meetup.com/net-user-group-of-bc/events/293540789/>
