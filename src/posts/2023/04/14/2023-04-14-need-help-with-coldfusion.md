description: A suggestion for finding help with ColdFusion issues.
---

As folks know, I *love* it when yall send me questions via email. I like to help others, I like to dig into issues and figure things out, and I'm always on the lookout to learn new things. However... 

As I just got an email about ColdFusion Event Gateways, I want to let folks know that my ColdFusion skills are somewhat rusty these days. You are *absolutely* ok to reach out to me about it, but I haven't used ColdFusion on the regular in probably over a decade now. (This week was an exception when I spent the better part of a day helping out one of our Acrobat Services customers who use ColdFusion.) 

So given that I thought I'd suggest folks consider the CFML Slack at [cfml.slack.com](https://cfml.slack.com/). When I've needed to do a few CF things recently I't gone there. It's incredibly active with lots of really smart folks. You'll find channels related to Adobe ColdFusion, Lucee, Box, and more. 

But of course, Slack *still* doesn't offer a way to allow people to sign up unless developers set something up on their own. I'm truly surprised that they haven't made a change in that area yet, but for now, if you want to sign up you just hit the form at [cfml-slack.net](http://cfml-slack.net/). Big thanks to Charlie Arehart for [blogging](https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/2/6/new_url_for_cfml_slack_signup) about the signup URL.
