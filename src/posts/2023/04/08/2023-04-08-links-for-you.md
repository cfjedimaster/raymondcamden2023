## 6 CSS snippets every front-end developer should know in 2023

Over the years, I've been incredibly happy watching the web platform mature and grow and while CSS is still my weakest area, I try to pay attention to its updates and latest developments as well. This [article](https://web.dev/6-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2023/) by [Adam Argyle](https://twitter.com/argyleink) covers six different CSS techniques developers should be aware of. I knew... none of them. 

## All JavaScript and TypeScript Features of the last 3 years

One good "tech roundup" deserves another. This [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/all-javascript-and-typescript-features-of-the-last-3-years-629c57e73e42) by [Linus Schlumberger](https://medium.com/@LinusSchlumberger) enumerates every single JavaScript and TypeScript change from the past few years. It's a huge list, but a good way to quickly see just how fast the platform is advancing. 

## And now for something completely different...

I like scary movies, but in general, I'm not a fan of gore. No, my main thrill is "creepy" movies, ghost stories with jump scares, creepy environments, etc., that's my jam. Recently I discovered a TikTok creator who uses CGI to create creepy short videos and I absolutely love it. I've often been a fan of media created from Creepypasta, like the [Channel Zero](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4820370/) show. 

This week, a [story from Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/best-creepypasta-what-is-backrooms-tiktok-steam-reddit-1850298058) hit my inbox about the Backrooms. The concept is simple. If you were somehow able to "no clip" (a video game cheat that lets you pass through walls) out of our reality into ... someplace else ... what would it like? Turns out it's pretty horrifying. 

If this sounds interesting to you, check out the [Backrooms playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVAh-MgDVqvDUEq6qDXqORBioE4Yhol_z) by @Kane Pixels. It's probably about 1.5 hours total and it scared the hell out of me. I'm willing to bet half or so of my readers will hate it, but the rest will (hopefully) be enthralled like I was.
