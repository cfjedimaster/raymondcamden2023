Next week, Tuesday August 8 at 11AM CST, I'll be giving a free, online presentation at CFE.dev on ["Automating Image Workflows with Photoshop APIs"](https://cfe.dev/events/automating-images-with-photoshop-apis/). Here's more information from the event description:

<blockquote>
Inarguably, Photoshop dominates the professional image editing software world. But did you know that many of the capabilities of Photoshop can be added to your own applications via Adobe's Photoshop APIs? In this session, Raymond Camden will show you how to add image automations including modifying and enhancing images with powerful filters using the Photoshop APIs.
</blockquote>

If you can't make it, just watch the recording later, and reach out with any questions.
