description: Last of the Year Links!
---

Welcome to the last [Links For You](https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/links4you) for 2024. Believe it or not, I started this series way back in April of 2022, and I don't know about you, but it's been one of my favorite features of my blog. I love sharing cool links (and music videos!) with readers, and I hope yall have enjoyed it as well. This is my *second* to last post for the year so there's still a bit more content coming, but for now, let's get into the cool stuff!

## An Alpine.js Bluesky RSS Reader

Folks know I love [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and this first post is a great example of why. [Andy Jarrett](https://www.andyjarrett.com/) demonstrates how he built a [RSS reader of his Bluesky profile](https://www.andyjarrett.com/posts/2024/creating-an-alpinejs-rss-reader-using-bluesky-profiles/) using Alpine.js. It's relatively simple to do so, and one of the reasons I think Alpine.js is so great is that it's a lightweight addition to your web page, versus heavier options like React and Vue. 

## JavaScript's Nullish Coalescing Assignment Operator

I'll be honest with you. I can't always remember all the "special" operators JavaScript has. Once again, this is a good reminder about why I tend to fail code tests in interviews. (And I'm fine with that.) In [this post](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/javascript-nullish-coalescing-assignment-operator), Trevor Lasn explains the nullish coalescing operator (`??=`) and how you can use it in your code. 

This is explained better in the post, but to be clear, this operator is not the same as the nullish coalescing operator. One is always going to assign a value and one (the nullish coalescing *assignment* operator) will only assign if the value is currently null. Take my word for it, just [read the post](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/javascript-nullish-coalescing-assignment-operator). 

## Destructuring in JavaScript

Last up is another JavaScript post, this one focused on destructuring: ["A guide to destructuring in JavaScript"](https://piccalil.li//blog/a-guide-to-destructuring-in-javascript/). This is a fairly intensive guide to destructuring filled with loads of examples. I thought I knew this topic pretty well but I definitely ran into a few things I did not know, so once again, this is well worth your time. 

## Just for Fun

Last but not least, how about a freaking **music** video built in CSS and HTML? Yes, just when you thought you couldn't fall behind in how awesome CSS has become, here's a great example!

<p class="codepen" data-height="500" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="jOgEyPO" data-pen-title="CSS Music Video - No Images - Pure Code." data-user="ivorjetski" style="height: 500px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
