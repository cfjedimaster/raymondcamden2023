Hello friends. The next, and final (for the year!) Code Break will be Tuesday, December 17th, one week from today. I've got some surprises in store and would love to use this last session to answer questions from my audience. If you've got a question you would like me (and others - oh wait, that's part of the surprise!) to answer, leave me a comment below and I'll try to get to it. I hope to see you there!
