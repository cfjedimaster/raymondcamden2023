description: Quick note about the next Code Break.

Hey folks, just a quick note. My next Code Break show will be *this* Thursday, December 5th, at 12PM CST. I apologize for the randomness of these sessions. My goal in 2025 is to get them a bit more consistent. We'll see how well that works out. ;) 

To RSVP for the next show, head over to <https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-12052024/>. I'll be doing more building on a blog with Eleventy. I'm also hoping to have another session later in the month!
