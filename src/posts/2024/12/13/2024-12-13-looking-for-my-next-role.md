This week I discovered, unfortunately, that my position at Adobe has been eliminated. I'm incredibly proud of what I've achieved during my time at Adobe, but now need to find my next opportunity. If you've ever gained anything from one of my posts, or presentations, I'd absolutely love a recommendation or referral for a position in developer relations. I'm also looking for a role where I could mentor, or lead, a team of developer advocates/evangelists. So, if you know of a role, or have a role yourself, please reach out!
