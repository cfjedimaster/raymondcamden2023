description: Happy GET ME A JOB Links Day
---

Good morning folks, as I [shared](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/12/13/in-search-of-my-next-role) yesterday, this week has been a bit rough as I found out my job was eliminated at Adobe, but the outpouring of support, and links to jobs, has been overwhelming. You people are pretty darn good, you know what? I'm confident I'm going to be able to land a good job, but at the same time, it's going to be a heck of a lot less stressful once I actually do. On top of that, I've got a head cold, which is annoying af as the kids say, but, I'm alive, surrounded by people who love me, well fed and warm, so all things considered, I'm pretty dang lucky. Let's get to the link.

## AI in the Browser - A Playlist

A month or so ago, and I'm having trouble finding the link, Google hosted a one day conference on AI in the browser, covering things like Transformers.js, Tensorflow, and their own efforts to add AI natively to Chrome. The playlist for the conference is available and it's got some great content. Each one is relatively short and can be watched over a lunch break, and I definitely recommend checking it out. I'm only about half way through myself, but plan on finishing it soon.

## A-Maze-ing JavaScript

Next up is a fun one, [generating random mazes with JavaScript](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/generating-random-mazes-with-javascript/), by [Paul Hebert](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/generating-random-mazes-with-javascript/). His post goes into the details of generating mazes, something that's fascinated me for years, although the last time I did anything in this space was with ColdFusion **way** back in 2009: [Generating mazes in ColdFusion](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2009/07/23/Generating-mazes-in-ColdFusion). Hebert's [post](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/generating-random-mazes-with-javascript/) does a great job of breaking down the steps and explaining the code. 

You can play with a finished demo below:

## Cooking with Eleventy

Last up is look at adding [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) support to Eleventy: [Adding Cooklang Support to Eleventy Three Ways](https://rknight.me/blog/adding-cooklang-support-to-eleventy-two-ways). As the title says, Robb demonstrates three different ways to add Cooklang, a recipe markup language in Markdown, to Eleventy. As I've said before, one of Eleventy's many strengths lies in it's customizability, and this is a superb example of that. 

I currently use [Saffron](https://www.mysaffronapp.com/) for my recipes, and while it's a very nice app, I'm almost at the limit of the free tier, and while I think the app has value, I'm don't think I'm going to pay the subscription fee to upgrade (if I could do a one time purchase I'd consider it). I've been thinking for a while now about moving my recipes to a simple web site. I talked about using Saffron's output way back in 2022, [Use Your Saffron Recipes in the Jamstack](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2022/04/11/use-your-saffron-recipes-in-the-jamstack), but I think I may look at converting Saffron's output to Cooklang instead. When I have time. Ahem.

## Just For Fun

One of the reasons my wife and I use Spotify so much is music discovery. We'll put on a favorite song, let it finish, and often Spotify will riff into things we like, and things we've never heard of. A few days ago, Spotify suggested "Indie Frequency", a playlist of new indie songs from black artists. Sadly, I don't think I recognized more than one artist on this list. Happily, it was damn good.
