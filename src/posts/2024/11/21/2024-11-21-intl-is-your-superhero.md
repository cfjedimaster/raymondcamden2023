description: Recording and links for my Intl presentation
---

Last week I had the pleasure of presenting at the [Mid-Michigan ColdFusion Users Group](https://mmcfug.org/) on the topic of [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl), the web platforms internationalization spec. I gave this presentation again this week at [connect.tech](https://2024.connect.tech/) as well. I *greatly* enjoyed working on this deck as I've been using Intl for a while, but had not had the opportunity to look into every nook and cranny. 

The slide deck may be found here <https://github.com/cfjedimaster/intl-is-your-superhero/> and viewed online at <https://cfjedimaster.github.io/intl-is-your-superhero/decks/main/>. 

The demos are all up on CodePen within one collection, which you can peruse here: <https://codepen.io/collection/oEKOwR>

And then finally, if you love hearing the sound of my voice, you can watch the recording:
