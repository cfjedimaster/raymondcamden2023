The last seven days have been... difficult. I don't think I need to go into why (even for my non-American readers), but I am doing my best, as are a lot of people, to take things day by day. Honestly, as a white hetero man, I'm not so much worried for myself, but I'm deeply concerned about my family and friends who are LGBTQ+ and other minorities. I don't talk a lot about my children here as I want to ensure their privacy is maintained, but seven of my either kids are adopted and Asian, and I my usual worry for them has risen quite a bit. 

Normally, my links here are almost always tech related, but today I'm going to do something different. The links below are resources that, I think probably folks in the groups I described above already know about, but if you're like me, it could help you help others, which is always a good thing. I promise to bring back the tech links next time, but this is too important to wait.

## LGBTQ Resource List

Earlier today I [asked](https://bsky.app/profile/raymondcamden.com/post/3laoetryrek2y) on Bluesky if any of my followers had any links/suggestions for resources for people who are LGBTQ. Unfortunately I didn't get any responses to that, but I did find a good list of links at [glaad.org](https://glaad.org) that may be of use. The list covers categories from youth to aging to legal and more so:

## RAINN

The [Rape, Abuse, &amp; Incest National Network](https://rainn.org/) first came to my attention when Tori Amos was their spokesperson in the 90s. They operate a sexual assault hotline and have programs meant to help prevent abuse and help survivors. At some point years ago they used ColdFusion and a developer there reached out for help. I was able to do something simple and small for them and I was glad to help out where I could.

## Stop AAPI Hate

I first heard of AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islanders) back when Trump was first elected. This organization was found to help stop racism and discrimination against both groups in America.

## One More...

Usually I end these posts with something fun, or cool music, but I thought this would be more appropriate. Honestly, I had no idea Kate McKinnon could play, or sing.
