description: My next Code Break will be Thursday, November 7

Hey folks - my next `<Code><Br>` will not be this Tuesday as I'll be presenting at [API World](https://apiworld.co/) (assuming American gets me there today) so I've pushed back the livestream till Thursday, November 7th. Usual time - 12PM CST. You can read more about the event here:

I'm going to be discussing [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and building a basic blog. I've wanted to cover Eleventy on my show for a while but was waiting for 3.0 to come out. Now that it has - I can't wait to introduce it to folks. Hope to see you there!
