Happy Half Way Through September... which isn't a thing I guess, but, I'm just in awe at how much faster time goes in the fall compared to summer. With the kids in school, and activities, time just seems to fly by. In roughly two weeks I'll (and my wife) will be in Vegas for the [Adobe ColdFusion Summit](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/). If you'll be there too be sure to say hi. Before then I'll be speaking online at the [JavaScript Global Summit](https://events.geekle.us/javascript/) next week. All of these upcoming conferences is just enough to make me forget I got a rejection today. ;) Lets focus on the positive, right, like some fun links for your enjoyment!

## CSS One Liners

First up is a great collection of [CSS one liners](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68055/ten-css-one-liners-for-almost-every-project) by [Alvaro Montoro](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68055/ten-css-one-liners-for-almost-every-project). As the title says, these are a set of simple CSS tweaks you can do to improve your web site. Even better, he shows "before and after" pictures of the changes so you can see exactly what they accomplish. 

## Alt Text Like a Dragon

Ok, maybe that's a bit over the top, but, the article, [Dungeons & Dragons taught me how to write alt text](https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/), is an incredibly good look at *how* alt text should be written. I think most folks (including myself) tend to focus on just ensuring we write *something*, but [Eric Bailey ](https://ericwbailey.website/) explains in detail what kind of information should go into your alt text (as well as what *shouldn't*). 

## Deep Dive into Location

Next up is a fun little article, [The <strike>Cake</strike> User Location is a Lie!!!](https://austingil.com/user-location-is-a-lie/). In it, [Austin Gil](https://austingil.com/) discusses the various ways to get a user's location, and what problems each of those approaches will have. Now, I will say I've got some problems with the article. (I'm mentioned in it based on my feedback. :) Specifically, I'm an incredibly strong opponent of basing a site's language on the user's location when browser's share (via a header) what language they prefer. That being said, this article is still absolutely worth your time. 

## And now for something you will hate...

This is a really bad but really fun video with Babymetal. I don't think it's bad, but this is the kind of thing you will either enjoy or absolutely, positively hate. Either way, turn your sound up and give it at least 30 seconds before you quit!
