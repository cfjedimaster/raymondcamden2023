Greetings, programs. This is just a quick note about my `<Code><Br>` show. Usually the show goes on every two weeks, but with the holiday this week I pushed it off to September 17th. You can find the details and RSVP here: ["Parks and Recreation - Using Leaflet and the NPS"](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-09172024/)

As the link says, this will be another stream involving [Leaflet](https://leaflet.js), which I've been having a *hell* of a lot of fun with the last few weeks. I hope to see you there!

And then on a completely *different* topic, I've entered the [Gemini API Developer Competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition) and honestly, I've probably got no chance to actually win, but I'd love for you to take a look at my entry, [Content Assistant](https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/content-assistant), and give it a vote if you like it. I'm also ok with you voting for it if you don't like it. ;) To be honest, it's an incredibly simple demo, but it felt like a decent example of the use of gen AI. Watch the video and tell me what you think.
