description: Announcing my next <Code><Br> Episode
---

Next week I'll be hosting my second episode of the [`<Code><Br>`](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-02202024/) show, "Shall we play a game?" In this session I'm going to talk about, and build, a simple web-based game. An hour is *not* a lot of time to do this so it will be a bit of a race, but I think this could be really fun. Check it out next Tuesday at 12PM CST.

p.s. As `<Code><Br>` continues, I'm not sure if I'll blog about *every* episode, but I definitely want to ensure folks are kept up to date so for now, I apologize for the noise.

p.p.s. Wait, this is my blog, I can do whatever I want. Enjoy the noise!
