description: A note on the July schedule for <Code><Br>
---

I'm probably worrying too much about this, but as the schedule is changing *slightly* for `<Code><Br>` in July, I just wanted to let folks know. Normally the next session would be Tuesday, July 2nd, but with Adobe being shut down that week I'm doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well, ok, that's a lie, I'll be doing stuff, but hopefully nothing by my office. 

The schedule for July will be:

* July 16th - Hacking Arduino Hardware as a Noob
* July 30th - Something else I'll figure out when I need to - do you have an idea?

This will be the longest break between shows so I wanted to sure folks were aware. Right now, the schedule isn't up on the [website](https://cfe.dev/talkshow/code-break/), but it will be in a day or so.
