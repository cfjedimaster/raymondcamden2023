This is somewhat last minute but it just came together in the past 24 hours. This Friday, at 4 PM CST, I'll be giving a free, online workshop on Alpine.js: [Web Development with Alpine.js](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-ontario-tech-university-presents-web-development-with-alpinejs/). Thank you to the Ontario Tech University Google Developer Student Club (whew, that's a long name) for inviting me to present to them. Just hit the link to RSVP and you'll be invited.
