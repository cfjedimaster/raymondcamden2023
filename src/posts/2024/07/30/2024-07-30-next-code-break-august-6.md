description: Quick scheduling update
---

Hey folks, earlier last month, I [mentioned](https://developer.adobe.com/firefly-services/docs/firefly-api/guides/how-tos/firefly-services-with-powerautomate/) a tweak to my `<Code><Br>` schedule, and originally I was going to have one today, but that has been pushed out to August 6th. You can find out more here: [Hacking Arduino Hardware as a Noob Pt. 2](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-08062024/)

My plan is to continue showing Arduino/web integration and I've got an interesting bug to share. (I love it when I make mistakes that are good lessons!) I hope to see you there!
