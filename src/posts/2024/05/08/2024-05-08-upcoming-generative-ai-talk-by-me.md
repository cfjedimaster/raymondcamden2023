I don't normally blog about upcoming conference talks, but I'm *really* excited to announce my first talk on generative AI, specifically [Google's Gemini](https://ai.google.com) will be in a few weeks at the [F/ND Tech Conference](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-craiova-presents-fnd-conference-2024/). This is a free, online conference covering a wide range of topics. My talk, "Adding Generative AI to your Workflow with Google Gemini", will absolutely be appropriate for beginners (as that's what I am) and hopefully provide a gentle introduction to working with Gen AI. Now, one point of warning - this is a Europe-based event so my talk will be... 5:45 AM on a Saturday morning, but admit it, wouldn't you *love* to wake up early on a Saturday to hear me talk about AI?
