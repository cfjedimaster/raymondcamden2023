Next week, a very cool, and very free, online event is being held by the fine folks at Certified Fresh Events, [theJam.dev 2024](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2024/). This is a two-day online conference covering web development, AI, serverless, frameworks, and certainly more than just the Jamstack. 

Speakers include Cassidy Williams, Alex Russel, Zach Leatherman (creator of Eleventy!), Riz√®l Scarlett, and more. I'll be giving a quick lightning talk on generative AI and writing, and you can see the [full schedule](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2024/) on the website. 

Did I mention it was free? Did I mention it was online? You've got no reason to miss this, so check it out!
