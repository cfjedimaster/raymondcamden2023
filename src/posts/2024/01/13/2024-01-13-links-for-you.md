Hello friends. This week has been absolute hell as I've been sick since Wednesday. I'm on the mend, but it's taking its sweet ole time moving out of my system. I feel like I can barely put two words together but I somehow managed to do some work, give and record a presentation, and... I think that's it actually. On a happier note, it's my wife's birthday and she's awesome, so that makes the day pretty dang good. Let's get on with the links!

## Huge list of deep debugging tricks

This came out a little while ago but I never got around to sharing it. The [list of 67 debugging tricks](https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/browser-debugging-tricks) is a fascinating collection of browser debugging tips. I thought I had a pretty good understanding of all the ways you could debug with devtools but wow, this post really blew my mind. Credit for this collection goes to [Alan Norbaur](https://alan.norbauer.com/).

## Introduction to Text Embeddings

Anyone looking at, or curious about GenAI, has heard about text embeddings. It's a fairly complex topic, and ["An intuitive introduction to text embeddings"](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/11/09/an-intuitive-introduction-to-text-embeddings) does a good job of *trying* to make it simpler. I'll be honest, I understood, kinda, about half of what was discussed, but it was definitely worth my time and at least helped improve my understanding.

## The End of Jamstack

Or is it? Zach Leatherman shares his thoughts in ["The Tension and Future of Jamstack"](https://www.zachleat.com/web/jamstack-future/). There's definitely been a shift in the community over the past few months and with Netlify seemingly moving on from the term... I kinda don't care. I view my tools, Eleventy, static sites in general, to be a powerful approach that's not going away anytime soon. It was never a golden bullet for all situations, but I continue to think "static first" before thinking about a full-on app server. 

Related to this, the CloudCannon folks are doing a great set of interviews that included yours truly:
