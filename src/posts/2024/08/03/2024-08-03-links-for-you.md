The past few weeks have been a bit crazy, although mostly crazy good. Since the last one of these posts, my family and I went on vacation in San Antonio for a few days, and currently, my wife and I are in New Orleans for a short break. Last night we went to the Postmodern Jukebox concert which was easily one of the most fun concerts I've been to. I'll share one of their clips at the end, but let me just say that they were a real treat live. 

## CSV for Eleventy

First up is a great example of why I love Eleventy - its flexibility. This post, ["Eleventy - Add CSV data file support"](https://www.roboleary.net/blog/eleventy-csv?utm_source=11tybundle&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=11ty-bundle-issue-48) describes how you can use CSV files in Eleventy to drive your content. Eleventy's [Data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data/) feature is incredibly powerful and this post by Rob O'Leary gives a great example of that. 

## Automating Redirects with Eleventy

If I've shared one Eleventy link, why not another? [Flamed Fury](https://flamedfury.com/), who wins the award for then coolest domain/name I've seen in a while, wrote up a post on creating a `.htaccess` file automatically with Eleventy: [Automate 301 Redirects In 11ty](https://flamedfury.com/posts/automate-301-redirects-in-11ty/?utm_source=11tybundle&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=11ty-bundle-issue-49). This also serves as a great time to remind folks that while his example uses Nunjucks, you can always recreate their logic in any of the other supported Eleventy languages, or just include it. Eleventy is fine with that. I normally recommend folks stick to one language in their project, there are times when it's really helpful to be able to mix in another language. I do this myself with EJS (although I'm removing those pages soon).

## Exploring JavaScript 

Repeat readers of [this series](http://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/links4you) know that I've often shared links to [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://dr-axel.de/). He has consistently, for years now, done incredibly deep explorations into JavaScript. He has shared the latest version of his book, [Exploring JavaScript](https://exploringjs.com/js/) for free on his website. You can, and I suggest you do, also purchase the book as well to show your support, but that is completely optional. (He even provides a helpful chapter to read [before you buy](https://exploringjs.com/js/book/ch_about-book.html#ch_about-book) to help you with that decision.) I especially like the ["New in"](https://exploringjs.com/js/book/ch_new-javascript-features.html#ch_new-javascript-features) section which breaks down updates by release.

## And last but not least...

Ok, so I mentioned above I'd share a Postmodern Jukebox track for you all to enjoy, so here's one of their latest. As I said, they are *spectacular* live!
