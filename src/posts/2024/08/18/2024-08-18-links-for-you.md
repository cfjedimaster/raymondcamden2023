description: Happy Football Links
---

Woot, welcome to football season! Ok, preseason, but I am beyond excited to watch my Saints play later today and, hopefully, look halfway decent. My wife and I are both big football fans and the start of the season is always a happy occasion. This past week I traveled to Atlanta to give a lab on Adobe's Firefly Services APIs which went well, and I get to do it again next week in New York City. I hope your week goes well, and here are some interesting links for you to enjoy.

## Migrating from Netlify to Cloudflare

In this post, [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) discusses how she migrated her site [from Netlify to Cloudflare](https://sia.codes/posts/migrating-netlify-to-cloudflare/). This was done primarily due to Cloudflare releasing a new service to [block AI crawlers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click), something she felt important enough to go through the work of a migration. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is pretty impressive and I've really dug their serverless support, and while I have no plans of migrating my site, Sia's guide is well done and could be helpful to others. 

## Pipedream Adds If/Else

Readers know I've been a **huge** fan of [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) for years now. They are, to me, the best Low Code solution out there. One aspect they were missing though was more advanced workflow controls like IF/ELSE conditions. Well, now it's here, well, almost here. The feature is available for testing but not quite done yet. You can find out more and see a cool demo below:

Personally, I really like how they implemented this, especially the support for collecting the results at the end of each branch.

## Handling Rounding Errors in JavaScript

For your last link, here is a deep look at [handling rounding errors](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-rounding-errors/) in JavaScript for financial applications. This isn't something I've ever had to worry about and always figured I'd research it when I need to, but I'm really happy I read this article as it was fascinating. 

## And Now For Something Completely Different

This is - easily - the most silliest and interesting form I've seen. I don't want to say anymore as it's just fun to experience it:
