Just a quick note to my faithful readers out there - tomorrow, October 22nd, at 12PM CST (Cool Standard Time), I'll be hosting my next episode of `<Code><Br>`:

In the [previous stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqVWXpvTEY), I talked about charting with JavaScript, specifically using Chart.js. In this followup, I'll attempt to use another library so we can compare and contrast. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a lot of fun. (I really enjoyed the last stream.) 

And with this being the last stream before Halloween - I may even dress up!
