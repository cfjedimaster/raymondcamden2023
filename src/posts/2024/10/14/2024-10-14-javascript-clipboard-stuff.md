description: Just a pointer to my series on JavaScript clipboard reading and writing.
---

Forgive the somewhat vague title, but I wanted to point folks to a series of articles I've had published on the [Frontend Masters blog](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/) the past few weeks. I started writing for them recently, and while I note my "external writing" on my [About](/about) page, I wanted to specifically call out this series. Over three articles, I discuss reading and writing to the clipboard with JavaScript as well as working with paste events:

* [Reading from the Clipboard in JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/reading-from-the-clipboard-in-javascript/)
* [Writing to the Clipboard in JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/writing-to-the-clipboard-in-javascript/)
* [Handling Paste Events in JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/handling-paste-events-in-javascript/)

That last article is an updated version of a [post of mine](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/07/03/working-with-pasted-content-in-javascript) from July, but it's got some new material in it so I definitely recommend checking it out.
