Over the years, I've built many websites, tools, bots, utilities, and while I've probably forgotten more than I remembered, I thought I'd try to list out the more interesting ones here on my "Stuff" page. This is my lab, my playroom, my collection of dumb ideas that were fun to build. Most likely none of what follows will be useful in any real way, but if it brings a smile to your face, that will make me happy.

## Games

As an avid gamer, I've enjoyed building my own web-based games over the years. Here are a few recent examples.

* [IdleFleet](https://idlefleet.netlify.app/) - an idle clicker game that has you build a space trading empire.
* [Cat Herder](https://catherder.netlify.app/) - another idle clicker game, although this one requires a bit more attention as you attempt to manage an army of cats.

## Random Sites

* [Cat Facts](https://codepen.io/cfjedimaster/full/jEbGKpV) - a collection of random cat facts.
* [Dad Joke](https://mydadjoke.netlify.app/) - a simple PWA for showing dad jokes.
